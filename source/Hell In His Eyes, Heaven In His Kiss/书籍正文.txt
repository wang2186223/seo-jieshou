###Chapter 1 One-Night Stand
Gabriela Haynes stumbled out of Room 1205 at the hotel before dawn, hair tangled, lipstick smudged,clutching her shoes with numb fingers.


Just before the company retreat, her world had caved in-her boyfriend caught red-handed with someone else. One heartbreak and two shots of tequila tonight,she'd lurched down the wrong hallway and let herself into the wrong room.


The instant she crossed the doorway, she spotted a man inside. Gabriela tried to retreat, but her legs gave out and she tumbled right into his arms.


He went rigid with surprise. For a heartbeat, there was only his low, startled murmur, then he gently tilted her face up and pressed his mnouth to hers.



She wanted to shove him away, but as his lips traced the line of her jaw and his steady heartbeat thundered beneath her palms, the alcohol and sadness blurred her senses. She melted into his warmth, helpless as her will slipped through her fingers.


By the time he held her waist tightly and thrust into her, everything had spiraled out of control. Once their lovemaking was over, regret hit GGabriela like a sharp and merciless wave. She slipped out as quietly as she could, nerves jangling.


She glanced back at the gleaming number plate on the door-and realized, with a jolt, that she'd spent the night in Brenden Saunders's room. He was the department's general manager.


A breath escaped Gabriela's lips as relief washed over her.


Brenden had a reputation for womanizing-his list of ex-girlfriends could fill a small phone book. A one-night stand with him meant nothing; he probably wouldn't remember her, especially since the room had stayed dark. He hadn't even gotten a good look at her.


She resolved to put this episode behind her, acting as if nothing had occurred between them.


Trying to wash away the remnants of their intimacy.she returned to her own hotel room and lingered under a steaming shower,then tugged a high-necked sweater over her head to hide the scattered hickeys on her skin.



No sooner had she finished dressing than Aubrey Holt,her ever-dramatic coworker, started pounding on the  door. "Gabriela! Open up! Something big just happened-hurry!"



Gabriela's pulse stuttered. Dread pooled in her gut.


Could her night with Brenden already be out in the open? It wasn't even sunrise yet.


Brenden held a high-ranking post at Apex Group,while she was just a lowly intern caught up in a mess she never meant to make.



If word ever got out, Brenden wouldn't lose a wink of sleep-he already had a reputation for chasing women and left a trail of rumors wherever he went. But for her, the fallout would be brutal. An intern daring to get tangled up with a senior executive? Her career would be finished before it even started.



With shaking hands, she cracked open the door.


Aubrey burst in, practically bouncing with excitement,completely missing Gabriela's ashen face and the stiff,self-conscious way she moved.


"Hurry up! You have to come with me-guess who's here? The company heartthrob himself! Mr. Moss actually showed up here!"


So that was all it was. Her secret was still safe, for now.



As Aubrey rambled on, Gabriela's nerves began to  settle, and she followed her into the bustling hotel buffet.



Wesley Moss-the company's enigmatic CEO-had only crossed paths with Gabriela once, back during her interview. Still, he was impossible to forget. He was dangerously handsome, the kind of man who could own a room without saying a word.



Wesley had built the entire company from nothing,transforming it into an industry heavyweight in just seven years.


Back at her interview, he'd barely cracked a smile,keeping his expression all business, but Gabriela had been instantly hooked. Quietly, she'd dubbed him her unattainable crush.



Now, there he was by the window, posture perfectly upright, exuding an effortless poise and silent authority that made him impossible to overlook-like the sunlight itself had picked him out of the crowd.



He looked so polished and self-assured that Gabriela found herself utterly entranced.


Most of the women in the room were angling for a seat near Wesley, their heads together in a swirl of murmured speculation and shy glances.


"Mr. Moss is unbelievably good-looking!" "I just realized-he's got a hickey on his neck!l wonder which girl scored that last night?"


The word "hickey" drifted over from the next table,making Gabriela instinctively yank her collar higher.The thrill of seeing Wesley instantly fizzled out as memories of her own recklessness from last night hit her.



Meanwhile, Aubrey practically vibrated with the urge to dig out the story behind the hickey, but Gabriela barely had the energy to acknowledge her.



Just then, Brenden strode in with his usual swagger and claimed the seat directly across from Wesley.


"So, did you get a good night's sleep?" he queried,a smirk curling on his lips.



Wesley took his time with breakfast, the corners of his mouth twitching with barely concealed amusement.Though his gaze swept the room, it paused-just for a heartbeat-on Gabriela, his eyes dancing with quiet mischief.



"Not bad," he replied, a cocky grin spreading across his face.



Gabriela instantly felt the weight of his once-over.Embarrassed,she hunched over her plate and shielded her face with her hand, desperate to blend into the crowd and disappear.


Brenden grumbled, dropping his voice to a dramatic whisper, "You snatched my room! I bet you slept like a king, while I wandered the halls last night hunting for a place to crash. Have a little sympathy,will you?"


With the entire Apex Group holed up at the hotel,every room had been snapped up. Wesley's last-6minute appearance at the retreat meant that as a 日（mere department manager, Brenden had no choice but to surrender the best suite.


07Wesley offered a lazy reply. "I'll make sure you get a raise later."
it

C Brenden's mood flipped instantly, a cheerful expression brightening his features.
###Chapter 2 A New Friend Request
Gabriela's table sat far from Wesley's, leaving her clueless about the hushed conversation happening across the room. She remained blissfully unaware that the man she'd encountered in Room 1205 last night hadn't been Brenden, but Wesley.


Watching Brenden wave his arms around, animatedly chatting with Wesley, Gabriela's nerves were shot.


Her pulse thudded in her ears, half-terrified she'd be recognized, but even more rattled by the fear that Brenden-the company's infamous flirt-might let something slip right in front of Wesley. She couldn't focus on a single thing all day, her thoughts spiraling with unease.



By some miracle, the day passed without incident, and the retreat wrapped up without drama.


When the company shuttle arrived to pick everyone up, Gabriela found herself lagging behind, every muscle in her body still aching from the intense lovemaking of the previous night. Moving stiffly,she ended up boarding last.



Aubrey spotted her and waved. "Gabriela, over here!" The bus fell into a sudden hush. Wesley's voice broke the silence, laced with impatience. "Is there really nowhere else for her to sit?"



Gabriela froze mid-step, her nerves jolting. Why was Wesley on the shuttle bus? Was that sharp tone directed at her? Was he annoyed she was holding up the line?



She was only an intern-surely the CEO didn't care where she sat.



She darted a glance toward the front. A gorgeous woman was already halfway into the seat beside Wesley, her cheeks flushed with hope. Wesley met her eyes with an icy stare and jerked his chin toward the aisle, clearly dismissing her.


A soft sigh escaped Gabriela when she figured out Wesley's words weren't meant for her


The woman shrank back, mumbling an apology before awkwardly squeezing into the row next to Aubrey-nabbing Gabriela's intended seat in the process.


With a scowl, Aubrey remarked, "That spot's for my friend."



The woman shot her a sharp, irritated look. "What?Does your friend's name come engraved on the seat?This shuttle belongs to the company-when did your  friend get an exclusive spot in here?"


Aubrey's jaw snapped shut, her glare smoldering with outrage.



Only one seat remained-right beside Wesley. For a split second, Gabriela thought about fleeing the bus and blowing her savings on a cab ride home.


But Wesley's gaze pinned her in place, his expression thunderous. "Well? Are you sitting down or not?"


Gabriela froze, completely thrown off.


Was he really getting irritated just because she hesitated?



With everyone else watching-some barely hiding their jealousy, others shooting her looks of sympathy -Gabriela finally took the seat next to Wesley, her heart pounding in her chest.



A tense silence followed,until Wesley leaned over and inquired, "Do I really look that intimidating?"


Gabriela silently agreed with every word, though she'd never dare admit it.



She might have been hopelessly smitten, but at this moment, Wesley's expression was all sharp angles and stern authority. If she spoke her mind, she'd probably be out of work before the week was over.



Instead, she mustered her brightest, most ingratiating smile and met Wesley's inscrutable stare. "Not at all,Mr. Moss. It's honestly an honor to sit with you."


Wesley's posture loosened a fraction. He leaned back,closed his eyes, and projected a chill so strong it could frost the windows.



Gabriela sat frozen with anxiety, trying not to fidget.



Luck really wasn't on her side.



She'd recently discovered her boyfriend was cheating and lost her virginity in a drunken blur. Now she was riding home beside the CEO himself, tense as a violin string, counting every minute until this ride finally ended.



The second Gabriela set foot outside the shuttle, she filled her lungs with the crisp morning air. For a brief,blissful moment, life seemed a thousand times brighter now that Wesley was nowhere in sight.


Aubrey fell into step beside her, practically bouncing with curiosity. "Tell me-what was it really like sitting next to Mr. Moss?"



Gabriela's expression didn't budge as she answered,  "Like a naughty child caught in the act."


Blinked in confusion, Aubrey pressed. "Why?"


Gabriela let out a theatrical sigh. "Because I wouldn't dare move an inch!"



A look of pure sympathy washed over Aubrey's face.Without another word, she suddenly hurried off,casting Gabriela a glance so mournful it was almost comical-like she'd just seen something terrifying.


Gabriela frowned, tempted to call after her, but something on her phone caught her attention-a new friend request on WhatsApp from a bizarre jumble of letters. Figuring it was just spam, she declinedit without a second thought.



Almost instantly, the same friend request reappeared.This time, there was a message attached. "You left something behind."



Gabriela racked her brain, trying to remember if she'd actually forgotten anything. As far as she could tell,nothing of hers was missing.



She nearly brushed off the message, but then a jolt of panic shot through her.



What if she had forgotten something in Brenden's hotel room last night? Her stomach dropped. That would be a disaster.



Was this friend request actually from Brenden?


With her nerves on edge, she hit"accept" and typed,"What do you want?"



Almost ten minutes dragged by before a reply finally popped up. "Teaching you,naughty girl,a goodlesson."


Gabriela's heart skipped a beat



Had Brenden heard her venting about Wesley earlier?That would explain why Aubrey had made such a hasty getaway.



But what truly unsettled her was this odd tone-the person on WhatsApp felt less like Brenden and far more like Wesley himself.


That couldn't be right, could it?



Gabriela raked her fingers through her hair, half-laughing at her own paranoia. Clearly, she was just being ridiculous.



Without overthinking, she hurriedly typed out a message. "About last night-it was all just a mistake,Mr. Saunders. Let's put it behind us,all right?"



The moment she sent it, dread washed over her. That sounded way too blunt. Panic-flushed, she yanked the  message back and tried again. "When would be a good time for me to come by and collect my things?"



Meanwhile, in the CEO's sleek office, Wesley sat behind his imposing desk. His jaw tightened as he read Gabriela's text. Each keystroke came down cold and deliberate. "You actually thought I'm Brenden?"



Gabriela could practically hear the tension crackling in the silence, picturing him grinding his teeth on the other end of the line. Her stomach twisted itself into knots as she responded,"Aren't you?"


The screen stayed stubbornly blank. Nothingcame back.





Was Brenden just messing with her this whole time,and now that she'd caught on, he was pissed off?


That was funny. If anyone had the right to be pissed off,it was definitely her.


These situations always ended up with the woman taking the fall,every single time.


If she had even an ounce of true courage, she'd be striking back, going after Brenden with no mercy.Losing her job? So what?



But deep down, she wasn't really that fearless.


Gabriela forced herself to swallow her pride and asked  quietly, "Mr. Saunders, when would you have time?I need to collect my things."



His reply was frosty and abrupt. "Just wait."


The blunt dismissal left Gabriela reeling, at a total loss.



Wait? But for how long?



With the team-building event over, everyone had left for the day. The shuttle had already dropped them at the office, and her colleagues had all vanished.



Even Aubrey was nowhere to be seen. Gabriela found herself alone in the echoing lobby, the empty space making her anxiety swell.



How long was she supposed to stand here, waiting for a man who clearly had no intention of making things easy for her?

###Chapter 3 He Was Just Plain Difficult
Night closed in, painting the city in deep shadows.


Gabriela sat hunched over her phone, the screen castinng a pale glow across her tense features. Brenden hadn't sent a single update about collecting her things,nor bothered to answer any of her frantic texts.


A cold dread seeped into her bones. What exactly was he waiting for? Did he want to corner her just to sleep with her again?


After last night's tangled, reckless affair, wasn't he satisfied?



She longed to walk away, but anxiety nagged at her


Apex Group was influential, and she considered herself lucky to have been accepted as an intern.Angering Brenden, her boss, now would be as good as throwing her own future away.


Gabriela sat alone, nerves raw, endlessly cycling through half-remembered fragments of the company's protocol in her head.

 
She tried every trick she knew to steady herself,even willing her own heartbeat to slow.


In the end, reality won out. After all, her entire future at Apex Group hung by a thread Brenden held.


Worse yet,she was the one who had stumbled into his arms last night-drunk and reckless. Even if she wanted to report him, who would take her side?


By the time the wall clock ticked past nine, Gabriela had sunk into numb resignation. At last, sharp footsteps echoed down the polished floor-leather soles striking the silence like a warning.



"Well, what do we have here? Who's still hanging around at this hour?" Brenden's breezy voice sliced through the lobby, cool and unhurried, making Gabriela stiffen.



She sprang to her feet, forcing composure into her voice. "Mr. Saunders, you are finally here."


Arching an eyebrow, he queried, "You were actually waiting for me?"


As if he didn't already know.


Gabriela swallowed her irritation, searching for a civil response, but Brenden cut her off,his tone suddenly sharp,"And what were you mumbling about just now?"


He'd noticed Gabriela from day one, mostly because of her striking looks. Shealways appeared so sweet and delicate-every bit the gentle beauty-but in reality,she was icy and kept her distance, completely unfazed by his usual brand of charm.



Why hadn't she just gone straight home after the retreat? What was she still hanging around the office for?



"I was reciting the company's protocol," Gabriela snapped, clenching her jaw before immediately wishing she could take it back.



Though Brenden typically treated his employees well but what if she'd just managed to get on his bad side?


While she scrambled for a way to fix things, a low laugh drifted in from the hallway. Gabriela turned and found herself face-to-face with Wesley, tall and impossibly composed, watching the whole scene unfold.



He filled the hallway, his sculpted features casting sharp. shadows beneath the overhead lights-a living,breathing work of art. No amount of cocky smirking could dim that allure; a face like his was magnetic in any mood.


Gabriela's pulse stuttered. Just standing there,Wesley somehow raised the bar for every man she'd ever laid eyes on. Brenden let out a snort, clearly amused by how completely Gabriela was captivated by Wesley.


He had to give credit to his cousin Wesley for his unmatched charm. Even Gabriela-the company's most aloof beauty-couldn't keep it together around him.



The sharp sound snapped Gabriela back to earth.



That was Wesley, the man who signed her paychecks -her forbidden obsession. And there she was,shamelessly gawking at him like a lovesick teenager.Did she have a death wish?



Gabriela forced herself to concentrate-getting her things from Brenden had to come first.


She snapped her attention back to Brenden.Saunders,about last night-"


Before she could get another word out, Wesley's voice sliced through the tension. "Brenden, go get the car.”、



Wesley always had his own driver, but Brenden clearly knew better than to argue. He shot Wesley a stiff nod and slipped away without a single complaint.


Now Gabriela was stranded in the echoing lobby with Wesley,nerves thrumming so loud she could barely  breathe. What was she supposed to do now?


Wesley's face was unreadable, but his cool stare made her wonder if he'd picked up on something between her and Brenden



Outside, Brenden pulled the car around just as his phone buzzed. When he saw it was his girlfriend calling,he shot Wesley a cheerful goodbye and sped off, eager for his own evening.


Wesley paid Brenden no attention. He slid into the car,shutting the door with finality.


For a split second, Gabriela finally exhaled, relief flooding through her. Maybe now she could escape.


Wesley's presence was so intense, she barely dared to breathe.



But before she could even move, Wesley's window slid down. His eyes, dark and appraising, landed on her "How are you getting home?"


Trying to sound casual, Gabriela replied, "Oh,I'll just catch the bus, Mr. Moss."



A sharp frown creased Wesley's features. "Get in."



Panic sparked in her chest. The idea of letting the CEO drive her anywhere was unthinkable. She quickly shook her head, hands raised in protest. "No, it's really  fine. I can take the bus, honestly."


Wesley fixed her with a look so unreadable it sent an involuntary shiver crawling up Gabriela's spine. She barely breathed as she eased open the car door,moving straight for the back seat-distance was safety, and right now, she needed every inch she could get.


Before she could settle in, Wesley's voice cut through the quiet, cool and razor-sharp. "Do I look like I run a taxi service or something?"



Though his tone was polite enough on the surface, the bite underneath made her heart lurch. Flustered,Gabriela quickly abandoned the back seat and slipped into the front beside him, fastening her seatbelt with shaky hands.



She kept utterly silent the entire ride. Wesley's face stayed icy, his jaw clenched tight and his mouth set in a severe line.



Gabriela clutched her bag so hard her knuckles turned pale; her fingers trembled uncontrollably.



After several interactions with Wesley today, Gabriela realized he was just plain difficult, his moods shifting like storm clouds.



She made up her mind right then: from now on, she'd keep her distance. When they hit a red light, Wesley looked like he might say something, but after a moment's hesitation,he just stared straight ahead in silence.


Even after she climbed out of the car, that look of cold disdain still lingered on his face.



Gabriela's chest tightened with frustration and a sting of injustice.



She hadn't done anything wrong. She'd never asked him for a ride, so why did he have to act so annoyed?



But the gloom was short-lived. Her irritation flared up -because just then, she spotted her ex,Dustin Owen,standing at the entrance.
###Chapter 4 Brenden Is Getting Transferred
Gabriela and Dustin had been inseparable all through college,dreaming up wedding plans the moment they got their diplomas.



But the minute Gabriela dove into her first real job,Dustin stabbed her in the back-hooking up with her cousin, Phyllis Haynes.



He didn't even bother to apologize. Instead, he looked her right in the eye and had the audacity to rationalize everything. "Gabriela, I do care about you,but honestly? I care more about having money. We're adults now. We can't just float through life on feelings.Let's not kid ourselves-besides being gorgeous,what do you actually bring to the table? We've dated for years, and you still won't let me touch you! Your parents are gone, and you have nothing to your name.If we-get married-if we ever buy a house or a car-it'll all come out of my family's pocket. It's not just the men's responsibility anymore; women have to contribute too. What can you offer? You can't even bring a single cent to the table. My mom's right-you're nothing but a burden. I'm done. Let's just end it."



At first, Gabriela felt devastated, convinced that maybe she really wasn't enough.


Now that she finally saw Dustin for who he was,everything snapped into focus. The cause of their breakup had never been her-it was Dustin.


He wanted to take advantage of his future wife for an easy life, all while spinning it so she'd feel like the burden.



And if it weren't for their breakup, she wouldn't have drowned her sadness in wine, leading to a one-night stand with Brenden.



In hindsight,she wanted to scream at her past self for ever being so blind. How had she let herself get swept up by someone like Dustin?



Now that he'd wormed his way into Phyllis's life,Dustin strutted around in tailored suts, every inch the polished poser, his shameless charm replaced by a mask of fake sophistication.


He intercepted Gabriela at the door, blocking her way."Why are you getting home so late? Phyllis hasn't slept a wink waiting for you, you know. You're a guest under someone else's roof-don't give the hosts anything to worry about."


Gabriela almost laughed out loud at the ridiculousness of his words. This was her own home!



On her deathbed, Gabriela's mother entrusted everything-eight-year-old Gabriela,the house,and the business-to her brother, Josh Haynes, asking him to take care of her daughter. That was how Phyllis's family ended up moving into the house her mother had left behind, all under the pretense of looking after Gabriela.



Now,somehow,she'd become the outsider in her own house.



Arguing felt pointless. She ignored Dustin. As she stepped forward to leave, his hand clamped down on her arm.



"How can you be so cold when Phyllis is concerned about you?" Dustin scolded, his eyes hard and full of judgment.



Gabriela didn't even bother to fake a smile. "My phone was on the entire time."



Phyllis's excuse was quite flimsy. Who actually waited up for someone without just calling or texting these days? The whole thing was a theatrical act-and somehow,Dustin had fallen for it.



He really was hopeless. Dustin's scowl deepened, impatience seeping into his voice. "Phyllis couldn't sleep because of you,and you still refuse to acknowledge her kindness? Is it that difficult to show a little warmth to your own family?After everything your uncle's family has done for you,this is how you act?"


He threw his shoulders back, self-important. "Go apologize to Phyllis. And from now on, let her know if you'll be late."



Gabriela yanked her arm free and marched into the house,done playing along.



Phyllis lounged across the sofa, one arm thrown over her forehead as if she might faint at any second.



Spotting Gabriela, she pushed herself upright, her voice trembling with practiced concern. "Gabriela,you're finally back! I've been worried sick."


Gabriela barely mustered a glance, exhaustion dulling her expression as she brushed past, intent on reaching her room.



But Dustin caught her by the wrist. "Seriously? Why the cold shoulder? Phyllis couldn't sleep because of you,and you just walk away?"



Phyllis rushed to play peacemaker,her tone soft and apologetic. "Don't blame Gabriela, Dustin.She has the  right to be upset with me since I hurt her."


Dustin wrapped his arms around Phyllis, glaring daggers at Gabriela. "This isn't on Phyllis," he said, his voice low and defensive. "If you're upset, take it out on me. I told you-my feelings changed, that's all.Don't blame her for it."



Gabriela couldn't keep up the charade any longer.Her lips curled into a cold, dazzling smile. "Oh,couldn't sleep? Sounds serious. Maybe get it checked out-insomnia's no joke. I'd hate for you to drop dead from missing a few winks."



Her words sliced through the room, and Phyllis's face drained of color. Tears sprang to her eyes, shimmering on the verge of falling.


"How could you say something like that, Gabriela?"Phyllis's voice wavered with feigned hurt. "You loved Dustin for so long-I get how much this must hurt. But you can't blame me for everything. Dustin and I, we genuinely love each other."


Dustin's expression twisted, his jaw clenched in irritation. "Gabriela, I never imagined you could be this bitter and petty. Honestly, I'm disappointed in you."


Phyllis immediately stepped in, pressing a gentle hand over Dustin's lips and gazing at Gabriela with an overdone look of sympathy. "Let's not be too harsh,  Dustin. Poor Gabriela might never find another man as extraordinary as you. She'll just have to settle for a guy who is way beneath your league. I can only imagine how much she's hurting.I feel for her."



Gabriela let out a cold, dismissive laugh. Please, she had just spent the night with someone like Brenden.She didn't like Brenden, but next to Dustin, he was practically a prince.



Gabriela refused to sink to Phyllis's level-she didn't have the energy for such pointless bickering.



Without a word,she retreated to her room and locked the door behind her, shutting out the noise from the hallway.



A hot shower washed away some of her tension. Soon after, she sprawled across her bed, staring at the ceiling as the whirlwind of the past few days replayed in her mind-ridiculous, almost absurdly overblown.


She braced herself for a sleepless night, certain her worries would keep her tossing and turning.Instead,exhaustion took over and she drifted off almost instantly.



When morning came, Gabriela shrugged off the gloom like an old jacket, determined to reclaim her usual carefree self.



At the office, she barely had time to set down her bag before Aubrey appeared at her side, eyes sparkling with mischief. "Did you hear the news? Mr.Saunders is getting transferred to one of the branch offices."



Gabriela's spirits soared. "Wait,what happened?"


For once, fortune seemed to smile on her. Things were working in her favor.



Aubrey leaned in, voice hushed. "Everybody knows he's connected to Mr. Moss. Naturally, only Mr. Moss could have arranged for his transfer." She added,barely able to contain her smirk, "He must've crossed the line with Mr. Moss."



He deserved that for antagonizing Wesley.


But Gabriela's happiness faded as quickly as it arrived.She abruptly remembered she'd left some things with Brenden, and a fresh wave of anxiety rolled in.



She turned to Aubrey, her voice tense."Do you know when Mr. Saunders is leaving?"



Gabriela's pulse kicked up a notch-she had to retrieve her things from him before Brenden disappeared from headquarters for good.



"I heard he's already clearing out his office. He'll be gone any minute," Aubrey murmured, glancing around warily. Without wasting another second, Gabriela rattled off a quick excuse, brushed past Aubrey, and ducked out of sight. She fished out her phone to send a message to Brenden.



"You're really invested in him, aren't you?"


The sudden, icy remark sliced through the air behind her. Gabriela's grip faltered; her phone nearly slipped from her hands.



She turned around, heart pounding, to find Wesley standing just inside the doorway. What on earth was he doing in the sales department?
###Chapter 5 Wesley Enjoyed A Little Flattery
Gabriela glanced up and found herself staring straight into Wesley's sharply defined, irritable features. One look, and she knew she'd wandered straight into a hornet's nest.



Brenden had already managed to provoke Wesley and been transferred on the spot. Determined to keep Wesley from suspecting her connection to Brenden,Gabriela rushed to distance herself.



"You're mistaken, Mr. Moss. There's nobody here l care about more than you," she blurted, pouring as much sincerity as she could muster into her voice.


The second the words left her mouth, she realized how misleading they sounded, and she fumbled for a way to explain. But then she caught a subtle shift in Wesley's expression-the faintest trace of satisfaction breaking through his annoyance.



Gabriela's eyes went wide with disbelief



So even someone as cold and untouchable as Wesley enjoyed a little flattery?



That was a revelation-a secret window into a side of  him she'd never seen before.



Determined to make the most of it, she pressed on."Honestly, you look extra sharp and energized today."



Wesley straightened, giving a soft cough as if feeling shy. "Oh? Is that so? What makes you say that?"



Gabriela froze for half a second, realizing Wesley wasn't the type to accept half-baked compliments.


She cranked up the flattery, her voice sugary-sweet."Truly, Mr. Moss, you're the whole package. You walk into a room and everyone else just fades into the background. No wonder people fall for you."


Quick thinking saved her yet again.



Even though her compliments were blatantly over the top, Wesley actually looked pleased. "At least you know quality when you see it," he replied, his tone lighter than usual.


With that, he strode off, leaving Gabriela with a sense of relief.



Billy Clarke, Wesley's ever-serious assistant, stared at Gabriela in shock like she'd just performed some kind of magic trick. He stole a few more incredulous glances her way, struggling to process what he'd just seen. How had she managed to serve up such cringe-worthy praise-and not only get away with it,but somehow put Wesley in a good mood?



As far as Billy could remember, Wesley had always been cold toward his employees. Yet somehow,Gabriela managed to earn his favor.



Billy quietly filed Gabriela away in his mind as someone to watch.



Once Wesley was gone, Gabriela hurried to unlock her phone and returned to editing her message to Brenden.



Only	thendid she	notice	his	new username: "NotASaunders."


The update made her do a double take.



What was that supposed to mean? She was confused,but she quickly pushed the matter to the back of her mind.



Hesitantly, she typed, "Mr. Saunders, are you busy right now?"


Almost instantly, a reply came back. "Of course."



Gabriela couldn't risk approaching Brenden directly,fearful that her involvement with him would be  exposed. She sent another message. "When do you have a moment? I need to swing by and píck up what I left behind."


This time, the chat stayed silent. No answer came,no matter how long she stared at her phone.


In the meantime, Brenden hadn't even finished emptying his desk before Billy swept in, practically marching him out of the office and shoving him straight into a waiting car-no chance to say goodbye,not even a backward glance at his old team.


A strange unease gnawed at Brenden's chest.


Wesley had looked him in the eye and promised a promotion-sworn he had a bright future. But why did it feel like there were landmines buried beneath every step from here on out?


He didn't dare voice his doubts. All he could do was grit his teeth and follow orders.


Gabriela,meanwhile,still hadn't managed to retrieve her belongings. She trudged home,heavy-hearted,only to walk through the door and be greeted by a cheerful Phyllis.



"Guess what, Gabriela? Dustin asked me to marry him,and the wedding's set for next month!" Phyllis lounged across the living room sofa, her hand outstretched to show off a monstrous diamond ring. The stone glittered ostentatiously as she gushed, "He absolutely insisted on getting me this one-ten whole carats! He must have dropped a fortune. Isn't it gigantic? Do you think it's too much to wear around?"



Phyllis loved to put on a sweet, innocent front for the world, but behind closed doors, she never bothered to hide her nastiest side from Gabriela.



The diamond perched on her finger was absurdly oversized, sparkling obnoxiously under the light.


Gabriela offered a bland smile. "It's honestly way too much. If I didn't know you, l'd assume you bought it just to flaunt. But that's exactly your style. The bigger and flashier, the better for you."



Phyllis's lips twisted, her temper barely in check. you actually jealous? Maybe you should focus on finding a boyfriend of your own, so I don't have to worry about you making a move on mine."


Gabriela fired back without missing a beat, "Please.The only one in this room desperate enough to steal someone's boyfriend is you. Trust me, your guy is the last person I'd go after."



Phyllis's expression hardened, her tone growing icy."Still pretending to be tough? From what I hear,your company's crawling with single guys. They may not measure up to Dustin, but they're enough for you. Just find anyone who's halfway decent and call it a day."



Phyllis gave Gabriela a once-over, her gaze sharp and full of hidden malice. "With your situation, Gabriela,you should really just settle for someone ordinary."



Back in school, Gabriela had always attracted her share of admirers. Out of sheer envy, she'd cooked up ugly rumors-accusing Gabriela of chasing money and even whispering that she secretly worked nights at a bar as an escort.



Whispers like that, repeated over and over, always found someone willing to believe them.



Little by little, the decent guys who'd onceliked Gabriela started keeping their distance. The only ones left were the bold, predatory types-harassing her,ridiculing her for pretending to be pure while selling herself on the side.



For years, Gabriela had lived in Phyllis's toxicshadow.


But now, with a coveted job at a top company.Gabriela finally had enough confidence to fight back.



She deliberately pulled out her phone-having recorded the entire exchange-and shoved it under Phyllis's nose.



"If you don't want Dustin finding out what a venomous snake you really are, I suggest you back off and stop messing with me."
###Chapter 6 Dustin's Just A Piece Of Garbage
Phyllis's expression twisted as she lunged for Gabriela's phone. "You're actually recording me? Wow.I should've known you'd pull something this dirty. Do you really believe this trick will help you snatch Dustin away? Keep dreaming!"



Gabriela slid her phone into her bag, her eyes icy."Please. Dustin's just a piece of garbage." She smirked,voice dripping with sarcasm. "Honestly, you're doing me a huge favor by taking out this trash. If you want to act like he's some priceless treasure,be my guest.Just don't expect me to fight you for trash."



Phyllis's hands shook with fury, but the fire in Gabriela's gaze-and the threat of that recording-kept her at bay. She could only choke out, "You're just jealous because you'll never have him."


Gabriela slipped back to her room and let the hot shower wash over her,hoping it would chase away the last of her irritation. Putting Phyllis in her place felt satisfying in the moment, but unease still gnawed at her.



Despite everything, she couldn't deny that Phyllis's  father, Josh, had always been decent to her. There was no way she could refuse his invitation to the wedding.



The thought of seeing all those former classmates,knowing they'd shower her with questions about her ex-boyfriend, made her stomach knot with dread.



The next day, a new frustration landed on her doorstep. Josh, newly back from his trip overseas, had a talk with Gabriela.



He wasn't even fifty yet, but his hair had already turned half-gray, a detail that somehow made his insistence feel even heavier. He always wore sleek black frames, his demeanor polished.


In every way, Josh was admirable, except for the fact that he was always pushed around by his wife, Marie Haynes.



Whenever he couldn't convince Gabriela to do something, he'd resort to tears without fail,and every single time, she'd end up relenting with a sigh.


Still, Gabriela felt genuinely glad to see him."Uncle Josh, you're finally back. How was your trip to Ceswienia?"



Josh managed a tense smile, the worry etched in the lines around his eyes. "Marie and I spent the whole trip searching for wedding venue inspiration. Honestly,it was more exhausting than relaxing-just nonstop work.She launched herself straight into work the moment we touched down-didn't even set foot at home first.It's..."



Catching on that he was about to launch into another never-ending complaint, Phyllis let out a subtle cough to steer him back.



Josh blinked, snapped out of his train of thought, and wrapped Gabriela's hand in his own, laughing kindly "I've met Dustin. I'm more than satisfied. In fact, I owe you one. If it weren't for you, Phyllis never would've landed such a fantastic match."



Gabriela marveled at Phyllis's shamelessness and played along, raising her brows in mock astonishment."Oh, you really don't need to thank me. Phyllis snagged exactly what she wanted, all on her own-she's quite the strategist."


Josh's expression froze. Hadn't Phyllis claimed Dustin was Gabriela's former classmate, and Gabriela was the one who set them up?


A glint of frost flickered in Phyllis's eyes, but she was quick to slip her arm through Gabriela's, pasting on a sisterly smile. "You're such a joker, Gabriela. Dustin's so popular-he's got girls lining up for him. I had to pull out all the stops just to win him over." Then Phyllis turned to Josh, her brow furrowed with concern. "Dad, I already have a boyfriend, but Gabriela's still single. She must be feeling a little down,and honestly, I'm worried about her."



Josh let out a heavy sigh, clearly worried about Gabriela's feelings.



Phyllis pressed on, her voice sweet but insistent."There's this professor in our department-his son's a decent man. He's smart, ambitious, and just so busy he hasn't had time to date. Maybe Gabriela could meet him? It might be good for her."


Josh, taking Phyllis at her word, turned hopeful eyes on Gabriela, eager for her to agree.


But Gabriela turned down that idea without hesitation."Uncle Josh, I'm only twenty-four. There's really no reason for me to rush into anything like that."



Phyllis persisted, her tone softening as she tried to coax Gabriela. "The guy makes almost a million a year,and he's really a good match for you. Just meet him,okay? If you're not interested, no one's forcing you."


A faint shimmer of tears rimmed her eyes. "I'm about to get married, and you still don't even have a boyfriend. If your mom were still here, she'd probably say we haven't looked out for you at all."Josh's face tightened with emotion at the mention of Gabriela's mother. He swallowed hard, his own eyes misting over. "Your mom entrusted you to me. Seeing you like this... I can't help but feel I've let her down."



Gabriela was fed up with Josh's guilt trips.



Whenever Marie and Phyllis made her life miserable,she'd try venting to Josh.



But he'd just listen, swallow Marie's version whole,and sigh, "Your mother trusted me to look after you.Watching you struggle like this-I can't help but feel guilty..."



Sure,Josh had always treated her kindly, but he never stood up to Marie. He handed her the company,caved in every argument, and let her walk all over him.



Eventually, Gabriela realized that kindness alone wasn't enough-Josh just didn't have the backbone to protect her. Later, she learned to fend for herself and kept her distance from Marie and Phyllis.



Even now, as an adult finally able to fight back against that malicious mother-daughter duo, Josh's guilt still left her feeling trapped.



She let out a weary breath, shoulders drooping in reluctant surrender. "Fine. I'll meet him." Josh's expression softened, his voice full of encouragement. "Relax, Gabriela. If even Phyllis is vouching for him, he must have something going for him."



Gabriela flicked her gaze toward Phyllis, just in time to catch the fleeting spark of smugness in her eyes.



Whatever game Phyllis was running, Gabriela was more intrigued than anxious to see how it would play out.



The next day happened to fall on Christmas Eve.


Gabriela brought a white dress with her, hanging it discreetly in her office. As soon as her shift ended,she changed, draping a pale coat over the dress before heading out.



Her entire look radiated a subtle elegance with just a hint of innocence-enough to draw a delighted whistle from Aubrey the moment she stepped into view."Wow, Gabriela, you look incredible today! Big date with your boyfriend or something?"


Gabriela shrugged it off with a small smile. "Nope.My uncle's just forcing me into a blind date."



Aubrey rolled her eyes, exasperated. "Seriously? At your age-why is he rushing you into this? Your uncle's really ridiculous." At that moment, Wesley strode by. They managed a quick hello, but he barely glanced their way, offering only a stiff nod before disappearing into the CEO's exclusive elevator, his face unreadable.

 ###Chapter 7 A Blind Date



The blind date was slated for the cozy corner of Vanilla Waves Café.



Gabriela stepped inside and lingered by the entrance for a few minutes before her date finally appeared.He wore a sharply tailored suit that only emphasized his middle-aged gut, but not even expensive clothes could disguise the bland, lackluster aura he carried.



His lips curled into a smug grin. "Apologies for the delay."



Gabriela offered a polite smile, her tone even. "No trouble at all."



The man raked his gaze over her, lingering just a beat too long before saying, "Rhys Fox. I assume Phyllis has already filled you in. She told me you're...a bit materialistic." He gave a thin, pointed smile, then added coolly, "Just so you know-I don't hand over my paychecks for anyone else to control. You'll quit your job once we're married and focus on running the household.I expect you to take care of my parents as well. In exchange, I'll give you an eight-thousand monthly allowance."



Rhys, who was in his early thirties, already sported a receding hairline and an air of smug superiority.


Gabriela had never cared much about looks, but his arrogance made her skin crawl.


Honestly,she had anticipated this. Phyllis had set her up with this man out of spite, not concern.



But Josh's earlier phone call-his anxious reminder to give the blind date a real chance-echoed in her mind.Swallowing her pride, Gabriela forced herself to stay civil, biting back every insult she wanted to unleash.


Rhys pressed on. "Phyllis mentioned you lost your parents, and her family took you in. They've done their part. Now that you're an adult, you should be independent and start living on your own. If you really can't find a place to stay, you could move in with me.We'll treat it as a test run-see if you can handle married life. But let's be clear: if I decide you're not suitable, I'll have you move out, no questions asked."


Gabriela's fingers itched to fling her coffee right in Rhys's face and snap him out of his delusions.


She forced herself to remain calm instead of causing a scene. For Josh's sake, she had to swallow her frustration.



Ten minutes dragged by before she finally snapped.She excused herself to the restroom, pulled out her phone,and begged Aubrey for a rescue.
When Gabriela returned, Rhys's face soured. With an air of reluctance, he finally said, "You're far from perfect, but at least you're easy on the eyes. My parents should be satisfied. After we get married, I'll make sure you learn how to behave. Are you at least decent at cooking? I expect my wife to handle those basics, you know..."



Rhys rambled on, barely pausing for breath. Gabriela stared at him, forcing a polite smile as her patience wore dangerously thin. Just then, her phone vibrated.Relief washed over her when she saw Aubrey's name flash on the screen.



She answered, voice pitched in theatrical annoyance."What? Overtime again? You're telling me the project's a disaster and needs revision right now?"


The act was flawless. Hanging up, she flashed Rhys an apologetic look. "Sorry, but I've got a work emergency. I need to head back to the office right away."



Rhys's brow furrowed, his irritation impossible to hide."You're really going to bail for work in the middle of our date?"



Gabriela lifted her hands in mock surrender. "I don't have a choice. My boss squeezes every drop out of us -nothing but ruthless capitalism these days." Rhys refused to be brushed off. His lips curled into a sneer. "If you walk out now, don't expect to see me again."



With a sweet, wide-eyed look, Gabriela countered,"Mr. Fox, this project is worth billions. If I nail it, I'll have enough for a mansion. If it tanks, I'm out of a job.Are you offering to buy me a mansion if things go sideways?"



Her sharp sarcasm cut straight through his ego Flushed with indignation, Rhys spun on his heel and stalked off, muttering under his breath, "Phyllis had you sized up from the start. All you care about is money."



Gabriela felt no irritation at all. She finished her coffee with a cheerful flourish, waiting until Rhys had completely disappeared before rising from her seat.


As she made her way toward the exit, a familiar figure caught her eye.


There,half-hidden in a shadowy corner, sat Wesley.Even seated, his sharp suit and commanding presence made him impossible to miss.


Caught off guard, she called out, "Mr. Moss?"


Wesley glanced up,returning her greeting with a curt nod and an unmistakably sour look. Gabriela's gaze flicked to the lovely woman seated across from him, then back to Wesley's unreadable face. The situation clicked in an instant. Leaning closer, she lowered her voice. "Wait-are you here for a blind date too?"



She couldn't help but wonder why someone as formidable and accomplished as Wesley would choose such an unremarkable place.


Wesley offered a barely perceptible nod before rising from his seat. "Heading back to the office?" he asked,his tone unreadable.



Gabriela suspected he'd caught her entire exchange from earlier. She mustered a respectful nod. "Yes, Mr.Moss."



Wesley's lips quirked in a faint smirk. "Billy just called.I'll head back with you and sort it out."



Gabriela's mind stalled for a beat.



Her supposed work emergency was nothing but a convenient excuse-was he playing along with her charade?



Still,if Wesley wasn't interested in this matchmaking setup,who could force his hand?



Though a whirlwind of questions churned in her mind,  she kept her doubts to herself and trailed after Wesley in silence.

###Chapter 8 Working Overtime
Wesley and Gabriela reached the parking lot. She lagged behind, dragging her feet. He glanced back,catching her reluctance with a knowing smile. "Aren't you the one who insisted on going back to work or risk getting fired?" His tone was light, almost teasing


Gabriela ducked her hnead and muttered, "That was just an excuse-I wasn't being serious."


"Oh?" Wesley arched a brow, voice turning flat."Does that include the part where you said your boss squeezes every drop out of you-nothing but ruthless capitalism?"



Gabriela froze under his cool stare,her heart skipping a beat.



She'd only said that to get rid of Rhys, never imagining her own boss would hear every word.



Wesley's mouth quirked in an unreadable half-smile,waiting. Gabriela straightened her shoulders and rushed to reassure him. "You must've heard wrong,Mr.Moss. I would never say anything like that about you.I'm all in for the company. No one's more loyal than l am. If you need me to run myself ragged,just say the word."



Gabriela kept her eyes glued to the ground for a long moment before finally sneaking a glance at Wesley.She caught the faintest hint of a smirk tugging at his lips.


He replied coolly, "Then come back to the office with me."



After they had settled into the car, Wesley took the wheel. The tension between them was thick enough to choke on. Gabriela barely dared to exhale, nerves twisted tight in her chest.


It was Christmas Eve-she'd dreamed of nothing more than shopping and curling up with some feel-good TV,but now here she was, stuck on duty.



At the office, she kept up appearances by tapping away at her computer, then mustered her courage and rapped gently on Wesley's door.


"Mr. Moss, I've finished my work. If there's nothing else, I was hoping I could..."


"Before you go," Wesley said flatly, eyes never leaving his screen, and slid a hefty stack of paperwork across the desk, "I want these sorted."



Gabriela's heart plummeted. The stack looked bottomless-just glancing at it made her dizzy.Two hours,at least. Probably more if she dared to breathe



Without lifting his gaze, Wesley remarked, "What's the matter? Was all that talk about how loyal you are to the company just for show?


So he had heard her. And apparently, he was going to hold her to it.



Gabriela quickly swallowed her true feelings."Absolutely not," she replied, her voice bright and obliging.



Apex Group's high salary and lavish perks kept her tethered. As an intern, she couldn't risk crossing Wesley-not even by a hair.


With a practiced, enthusiastic smile,she accepted the towering stack of documents and inquired, "Usually this kind of thing goes to your assistant, right?"


"He's in the hospital. Something he ate didn't agree with him."



Meanwhile, Billy sat at home, poking half-heartedly at a bowl of instant noodles, his mind churning with anxious thoughts about his own future.


Wesley had never let him off the hook, even for major holidays.



But now, on just a plain old Christmas Eve, he'd been sent home? The whole thing felt off.


Was Wesley disappointed in how he tackled that last project?



Meanwhile,silence gripped Gabriela. She couldn't form a single word.


Wesley was the CEO, after all. Whatever he said,she had no choice but to accept.



Suppressing a sigh, Gabriela dutifully started on the mountain of paperwork.



But she'd joined the company with dreams of working in sales, not drowning in documents she barely understood.



Wesley glanced up, picking up on her hesitation. His tone softened, surprising her. "You can organize them here. If you run into anything confusing, just let me know."



She straightened, relieved by the offer. "Thank you,Mr.Moss."



The silence in the CEO's office felt almost sacred,broken only by Gabriela's tentative footsteps as she drew near to ask Wesley about the documents. Each time she approached, his clean, understated scent drifted her way.Alone with him in that hushed, exclusive space,Gabriela's pulse thudded with excitement.



He was her ultimate office crush, and being close enough to catch the details of his scent almost made working late seem worth it.



She worked fast and smart, managing to sort the intimidating stack of documents in just ninety minutes.


Stretching her arms overhead, convinced she was finally free, she froze as someone suddenly shouted out in the hallway, the sharp sound punctuated by the heavy slam of the main office door.


A chill crept up Gabriela's spine. Instinctively,she bolted to the exit, only to find the door firmly locked.


She banged on it and shouted for help, but the security guard was already drifting away down the hall,oblivious.



As she spun around, Wesley appeared behind her, his tone unruffled. "Our security guard's hearing isn't what it used to be."



Gabriela blinked, incredulous. "How does a massive company like this end up with a guard who can barely hear?"



Wesley shot her a sharp look. "We don't discriminate here. Everyone deserves a chance, disability or not."


Flustered,Gabriela quickly backtracked.


She didn't have a problem with people who had disabilities. In fact, she was always the first to stop and guide anyone blind across a crosswalk.


She was just caught off guard; that was all.


Realizing the guard couldn't hear her, Gabriela pulled out her phone to call for help, but not a single bar appeared.


Such a useless phone-she was already eyeing a replacement as soon as she got paid.


Desperate, she glanced at Wesley, silently pleading for help. He responded with a careless shrug, lifting his own phone. The screen was black, no life in it."Battery's dead," he said, not the slightest bit bothered.


She stared at him in disbelief.



He added, "My secretary usually handles small tasks like charging my phone."


Gabriela could only gape, a mix of frustration and awe rising in her chest. Typical CEO-helpless when it came to anything remotely practical.



Before she could finish silently grumbling,Wesley said, "I'm starving. Whip up something to eat."


Unbelievable. Overtime wasn't enough-now he expected her to play chef,too?


She mustered a protest. "Mr. Moss, we're literally locked in the building."



It wasn't an exaggeration. The two of them were trapped on the twelfth floor. Was she supposed to conjure dinner out of thin air?



Wesley just gestured toward the far corner. "My office has a lounge. Fridge is fully stocked."



Curiosity tugged at her as Gabriela stepped inside and spotted a snug kitchen bursting with every ingredient imaginable.



Left with no excuse, Gabriela resigned herself to the task and whipped up a simple pasta.



As she set two steaming bowls on the table, curiosity got the better of her. "So, why keep a whole kitchen's worth of groceries in your office, Mr. Moss?"


Wesley leaned back,his tone nonchalant. "Sometimes I'm here late, so I keep a few things stocked. Never know when you'll need them."


Apparently, he really did treat his office as a second home. Gabriela found herself quietly impressed. So even the legendary Wesley Moss was no stranger to late nights.Raking in millions clearly meant putting in the hours.



Wesley offered for her to stay and have her meal there.



Gabriela shook her head. "No thanks-I usually stream a show while I eat. It just makes dinner more fun."


Honestly,nothing beat zoning out to a drama on her phone with a plate of food in hand.


There was no way she could get away with that kind of behavior in Wesley's presence. That would just be crossing a line.



Wesley's gaze turned stormy. "You're implying you can't eat while staring at me?"



Gabriela froze, caught off guard.



Honestly, only Wesley could twist her words into something so dramatic.
###Chapter 9 Asking Him To Pretend To Be Her Boyfrie...
Gabriela remembered just how much Wesley relished a little flattery and wasted no time playing to his ego."Absolutely not, Mr. Moss. With a face like yours across the table, I'm worried my appetite might spiral out of control. I'm trying to watch myfigure,you know."


Wesley's expression stayed stoic, but a flicker of amusement threatened to break through his rigid facade.



Under the pressure of his cool, scrutinizing gaze,Gabriela found herself sharing an awkward pasta dinner with him.



She couldn't help digging in-every bite was enthusiastic, the clatter of her fork echoing off the conference table. She ate as if the meal was the highlight of her week, savoring every last bite.



But halfway through, she noticed Wesley had set down his fork and was studying her, eyebrows drawn together.



Startled, she wiped her mouth and quickly checked for any stray sauce before nervously inquiring,something wrong, Mr. Moss?" Wesley regarded her with dry exasperation. "Watching you eat at that speed, it's giving me the wrong impression."



Gabriela ducked her head. "What impression?"



He didn't hesitate as he remarked, "Honestly, it feels like I'm shoveling food to a hungry pig."



Gabriela replayed Wesley's words, feeling her blood simmer.Did he seriously just call her a pig? The nerve.



If only she could turn the tables and fire this arrogant boss for once. But reality bit back-her job was nowhere near that secure.



Reluctantly accepting her fate, she slowed her pace and dragged her fork through the pasta-twirling each strand with the precision of a food critic instead of her usual gusto.



Wesley finally deemed her behavior acceptable and resumed eating, visibly appeased.



Bored by her own exaggerated caution,Gabriela risked a sideways glance at Wesley. He wasn't just handsome -he had a natural grace, every movement refined.



Even the way he handled a fork was oddly mesmerizing. How was anyone supposed to compete with that? Honestly, he was the definition of adreamboat.



Once the meal was over, they handled the dishes together in awkward silence, the unspoken question of their sleeping arrangement hanging heavy between them.



Wesley's office featured a sleek lounge complete with a king-sized bed, as if it belonged in a luxury hotel.



He gestured toward it, inviting her to take the bed for the night.



Gabriela understood the unspoken rules of corporate survival all too well. If she dared let Wesley sleep on the sofa while she took the bed, she could kiss her job goodbye.



Steeling herself, she opted for the sofa without hesitation,and Wesley didn't press the issue.


Yet when morning arrived, Gabriela woke in a daze-nestled beneath the covers of Wesley's bed.



For a split second, she wondered if she was still dreaming. The memory of climbing into bed never surfaced. But there was no way the famously reserved Wesley would carry her-a mere employee-all the way over here.



Had she sleepwalked in the night? Flushed with panic, Gabriela scrambled out of bed and rushed to find Wesley and clear up the confusion.



She found him already impeccably dressed, seated at his desk, reading over documents as if nothing unusual had happened at all.


Overnight, the easygoing guy who'd shared dinner with her had vanished,replaced by the formidable CEO whom everyone admired but dared not cross.


Gabriela was still scrambling for a plausible excuse when Wesley shot her a cool look. "Why are you just standing there? Pull yourself together-Billy will be here any minute."


His words jolted her out of her thoughts. She was only an intern, and if anyone caught wind that she'd spent the night with the CEO-even under innocent circumstances-it would spark all kinds of rumors.That kind of gossip could do real damage, both to her and the company's reputation.


Wesley had covered every single detail without missing a beat.



Since he didn't seem bothered, there was no point in trying to defend herself. She gathered her things and offered a quick farewell, making a swift exit just as Billy bounded out of the elevator, his energy a sharp contrast to her nerves.
Billy paused mid-step, clearly caught off guard to find Gabriela there so early in the morning. He thought about Gabriela's bumbling attempt at flattery-and Wesley's uncharacteristic generosity. The more he dwelled on it, the more he felt like he'd stumbled onto some explosive office secret.



Gabriela was just as thrown.



Hadn't Billy been out sick yesterday, supposedly curled up at home with a stomachache?



Yet here he was, striding into work as if nothing had happened, the picture of health and efficiency.



That level of loyalty was rare-no wonder Wesley trusted him with everything.



When Gabriela was back in the sales department,Aubrey wasted no time pulling her aside, eager to hear every awkward and embarrassing detail of her blind date.



When Gabriela shared some of Rhys's most arrogant lines,Aubrey burst out laughing, barely able to catch her breath. "You're young, gorgeous, and honestly? If you wanted a boyfriend, there'd be a line out the door.Why torture yourself with blind dates?"



Gabriela let out a weary sigh,her frustration simmering just beneath the surface. Even if she dodged this setup by blaming work, she knew Phyllis would just cook up another scheme soon enough.



The only real solution was to find herself a boyfriend.But where was she supposed to pull one out of thin air?



That was when an idea hit her-a single name popped into her mind: Brenden.



Sure, he had a reputation for being a bit of a notorious flirt, but he was undeniably attractive, and more importantly, he always treated women with an easygoing patience that set him apart.



She remembered that night they'd shared together.Asking him to play the part of her boyfriend for one day didn't seem like such an outrageous favor.



Decision made, Gabriela grabbed her phone and fired off a message to "NotASaunders" on WhatsApp."Hey,Mr.Saunders. Got a sec? I need a favor."



There was a long stretch of silence before his response finally popped up. "What kind of favor?"


Gabriela didn't hesitate. She'd already mapped out her request in her head. "My cousin's getting married next month, and I really need a date for the wedding.Would you be willing to pretend to be my boyfriend for just one day?"



His answer came back almost instantly. "Absolutely not."



The text was blunt, but she could practically feel his annoyance radiating from the screen, which caught her off guard.



Aubrey-the office's queen of gossip-had always told her that while Brenden carried a reputation as a player,he wasn't the type to mess around with women.Even after breakups, he was the raresort who parted on good terms, always making sure his exes landed softly with generous compensation.



But this wasn't a breakup. She wasn't even asking for money-just a simple act. So why did he shut her down so fast?



She sent another message, her words genuinely earnest this time. "Mr. Saunders, I really don't have any guy friends I can ask. Could you please do me this favor?"



His response finally came through. "I can help, but I'm extremely busy. My time doesn't come cheap. How are you planning to repay me?"



His time didn't come cheap? Why not just claim that he made millions every minute like Wesley? Gabriela rolled her eyes and typed back, "Fine.How much for a day of your precious time?"



"I don't want money."



HHis smug reply made her heart lurch unexpectedly.



If it wasn't cash he was after, what was Brenden getting at? She was just a broke intern-what else could he possibly want from her?



An uneasy suspicion crept in. Was he hinting that he wanted to sleep with her again?
###Chapter 10 A Dress



As Gabriela recalled the passionate night they had shared, a chill rippled down her spine-the memory of how intense Brenden had been in bed made her skin prickle.



Absolutely not!



If sleeping with Brenden again was the price for his fake-boyfriend act, she'd rather scrap the whole plan.



Why should she feel uneasy attending her cheating ex and backstabbing cousin's wedding? If anyone should crawl under a rock, it should be them.



As for Josh... if he wound up bawling, well, she'd just sit beside him and sob too.



Gabriela was seconds away from texting him that she didn't need his favor anymore, when another notification flashed on her screen. "There's a banquet tonight,and I want you by my side."



Gabriela's eyebrows shot up.



Brenden had enough girlfriends to form a soccer team.

How could he possibly be lacking a date?



Almost as if he'd heard her thoughts, another message popped up. "It's a formal event."



So he really did know none of his so-called girlfriends could pass for decent in public.


She stifled an eye roll and replied, "Noted. I'll be on my best behavior at tonight's banquet."



Inside the spacious CEO's office, Wesley divided his attention between a mountain of paperwork and the constant stream of notifications on his phone. The corner of his mouth curled into a subtle, self-satisfied smile.



Then, as if an unwelcome thought had slipped in, his gaze darkened and the smile vanished.



He sent off a message, his words sharp as ever."Don't get ahead of yourself. You're not that impressive. Still, compared to the women I usually date, your looks are at least acceptable."



Gabriela stared at her screen, momentarily stunned by the blunt reply.


Why did Brenden seem to relish making things so difficult for himself? If he was so dissatisfied with his choices, what was the point of chasing after one disappointing girlfriend after another?



Despite her confusion, Gabriela had managed to rope in a fake boyfriend for the wedding. With that problem checked off her list, she turned her focus back to work.



At lunch, Aubrey slid into the seat across from Gabriela, eyes alight with gossip. "Did you hear about Alphacom Electronics?"



Whenever there was company news, Aubrey never failed to find Gabriela first, bursting with details long before anyone else.



Gabiela, on the other hand, was usually out of the loop."What happened with Alphacom Electronics?"



Aubrey leaned in, lowering her voice as if sharing a state secret. "They're about to go through a full restructure, and there's a massive deal coming-think,at least a billion dollars. Every sales manager in the building is fighting tooth and nail for it. Can you imagine the commission on something like that?" She shook her head in awe, envy flickering in her eyes."Of course, there's no way us interns would ever be allowed anywhere near something that big."



A wave of shock washed over Gabriela.



Just last night, she'd offhandedly mentioned to Rhys that the company was chasing a multi-billion-dollar contract. Now it was happening for real.



Was she some kind of corporate lucky charm? Had Wesley somehow caught wind of her accidental prediction?



Maybe-just maybe-she'd get pulled into the middle of it all.



Gabriela was tempted by the deal.


If she managed to play a part in securing it, her spot at the company would be practically guaranteed.


All day, the atmosphere crackled with tension. Sales department buzzed like a hive,each team hellbent on landing the contract.



Gabriela also dove deep into her research,combing through every scrap of information she could find on Alphacom Electronics.



Just as evening settled over the office, a sharply dressed young man appeared at her desk.He handed over a sleek gift box, his manner impeccably polite as he asked her to sign for it.



Aubrey, unable to contain her curiosity,peered over Gabriela's shoulder and gasped, "Isn't that the SK Elite Boutique logo? That's top-tier luxury. Not just expensive-exclusive. You can't even get your hands on their stuff unless you're part of the club."



Her voice dropped to a hushed tone. "The membership alone starts at a million-just to walk through the door." Gasps rippled through the office as her colleagues clustered around, eyes fixed on the extravagant gift box.



Gabriela barely got a glimpse before she was jostled to the edge of the crowd, her pulse racing just as wildly as everyone else's.



Even in her wildest dreams, she couldn't imagine owning anything from SK Elite Boutique-not even Phyllis could afford that level of luxury.



It was impossible. There was no chance this was actually meant for her-it had to be some kind of mistake.



Gabriela had barely opened her mouth to protest when Phyllis swept in, all drama and flair in a cherry-red wool coat that set off her freshly dyed,wine-red hair.



Trailing her was an obedient assistant clutching her designer handbag, the perfect prop for Phyllis's self-appointed aura of command.



All the noise in the office had drawn Phyllis like a moth to a flame. The moment she spotted the gift box,her expression soured.



Inside was the newest SK Elite Boutique design-a dress so exclusive so exclusive that even deep pockets couldn't guarantee acquiring it.



Phyllis instinctively glanced down at her own ten-carat ring. When Dustin first slipped it on her finger,she'd felt like royalty. But now, after she knew it was just a standard eight-thousand-per-carat diamond fitted into a custom setting, it suddenly seemed almost ordinary next to this dress.



How the hell was Gabriela supposed to afford a dress that expensive? Even if she auctioned off everything she had, she wouldn't make a dent in the price.



With a sharp, mocking smile, Phyllis scoffed,"Did you seriously bring a fake? If you can't afford the real thing, don't bother showing off. It's just sad."



Phyllis's grand entrance turned every head in the room.For a moment, nobody spoke. All eyes swept over her,silently wondering who she was-someone with that much presence had to be important.



Catching everyone's gaze, Phyllis tossed her hair back smoothly and flashed a confident smile as she offered a poised introduction.



"Hello, everyone. I'm Gabriela's cousin," she announced,her voice ringing out with effortless charm."I'm sorry to intrude, but I just had to deliver Gabriela's wedding invitation myself. It means so much more when it comes from family, don't you think?" Aubrey edged closer to Gabriela, murmuring under her breath, "Is it just me, or does your cousin come off a little two-faced?"



Gabriela met Aubrey's eye and replied, equally low,"Trust me, you're not wrong."



With all the grace of a pageant queen, Phyllis passed the invitation to Gabriela, her smile sweet but edged with malice. "I know you adore designer labels," she said, her tone dripping with honeyed condescension."But honestly, you shouldn't wear knockoffs, even if you love them. Imagine how humiliating it'd be if everyone noticed. Isn't that right?" She turned to the crowd,looking to gain their support.


At her words, the mood shifted. Gabriela could feel the room's energy curdle as colleagues eyed her with suspicion, their previous impressions unraveling.



Gabriela, once considered approachable and unpretentious, now found herself painted as the type who shamelessly paraded around in knockoff designer labels.



She leveled Phyllis with a frigid stare, her patience stretched to the limit.


 
As always, Phyllis seized every opportunity to tarnish her name.Gabriela wasn't concerned about Phyllis's petty digs,but she did care about her job-and how her colleagues saw her.



She opened her mouth, ready to defend herself.


Before she could get a single word out, the deliveryman interjected in a steady, professional tone."Please don't make baseless accusations, miss. This dress is a genuine piece from SK Elite Boutique. I'm an official courier for the company-here's my employee number. You can verify it yourself online if you have doubts."



He spared Phyllis a pointed glance-no interest in stirring up drama, but unwilling to stand by and let anyone question the dress's authenticity.



Protecting the brand was his job, and he took it seriously.

###Chapter 11 He Likes To Spoil Me
Curiosity surged as colleagues scrambled to verify the claim online, and within moments, they found the listing-complete with a photo of the deliveryman himself.



A wave of gasps and excitement rippled through the office. "Holy crap, it's legit!"



"No way-let me see that!"



"It matches exactly! That's the same dress. SK Elite Boutique,for real!"



The buzz swelled, voices overlapping in a rush of disbelief and envy.



Meanwhile,color drained from Phyllis's face,leaving her exposed and speechless.


She'd never expected the dress to be genuine, let alone straight from SK Elite Boutique.


Gabriela-the person she'd belittled all her life, the one from whom she'd stolen a boyfriend-somehow owned a dress from SK Elite Boutique that even she couldn't afford. How was that even possible? Of course Gabriela could never afford a dress like that. Not in a million years.


Given her limited finances, there was no way Gabriela had the means to purchase it herself.


Phyllis, after a beat, forced an apologetic smile. "Oh,Gabriela, I must've jumped to conclusions. I had no idea. SK Elite Boutique dresses cost a fortune.Just getting the chance to buy one is practically impossible I really didn't think you could get your hands on something like that."



Aubrey, fed up with Phyllis's thinly veiled barbs, shot her a glare. "Maybe it was a gift."


Phyllis's eyes narrowed, but her lips curled into a sly smile. "A gift? Who on earth would give away something so extravagant? Unless, of course..." She covered her mouth with exaggerated surprise."Gabriela, don't tell me you've got yourself a boyfriend now?"



Gabriela, who'd been convinced the dress was a delivery mistake, only caught on when she heard someone Phyllis's words.



That was right-she'd promised Brenden, just this morning,she would be his date for the banquet.



Could this jaw-dropping dress actually be from him? All day she'd fretted about how to afford a breathtaking dress, but apparently, Brenden had already solved that problem without a word.



He did have a reputation for spoiling women, but Gabriela had never experienced it herself-until now,with this extravagant surprise landing squarely in her lap after a one-night stand. So this was what it felt like to be truly doted on.



Recalling how Brenden had agreed to play her boyfriend, Gabriela faced the crowd with steady poise and confirmed, "Yes. I have."



Phyllis's eyes flashed green. Unable to keep the bite from her voice, she sneered, "Wow,your boyfriend must be rolling in it if he's buying you designer dresses like that."



Gabriela flashed Phyllis a smug smile and shot back,"What can I say? He likes to spoil me-and at least he's not living off someone else's dime."



Phyllis's jaw clenched, the sting of Gabriela's jab unmistakable. She knew perfectly well Gabriela was talking about Dustin, but there wasn't a single retort she could throw back.



It was true-Dustin's family had always struggled; he worked for Haynes Group, depending on her family's wealth to get by But that was perfectly fine. Dustin was good-looking,carried himself with confidence, and had a prestigious degree under his belt. He'd graduated a year before Gabriela and already knocked out a master's degree.



Marie never missed a chance to praise Dustin's ambition and potential.



And most importantly, Dustin was the prize Phyllis had stolen from Gabriela. Victory always tasted that much sweeter when you'd ripped it right out of someone else's hands.



Gabriela,freshly dumped by Dustin, had somehow managed to land herself an even more extravagant boyfriend-how on earth? She seemed to have sunk her claws into some gaudy, deep-pocketed sugar daddy.



Imagining that Gabriela had become the lover of a wealthy but distasteful and lecherous older man,Phyllis felt secretly pleased, a poised smile returning to her face.



She turned to Gabriela, voice syrupy sweet. "I'm getting married next month, Gabriela. You have to bring your boyfriend. We've already set aside the bridesmaid and groomsman spots just for you two."



Her lips curled with a hint of malice as she went on,"The groomsman does have to be single, though Does your boyfriend meet the requirements?"



Gabriela didn't hesitate. "Absolutely." She caught the mischief gleaming in Phyllis's eyes, but she wasn't fazed.



Brenden might have a reputation as a player, but his looks and his background made Dustin look positively ordinary-a true standout, even if he wasn't quite in the same league as someone like Wesley.



Gabriela's lips curved into a confident smile. "Trust me,he'll fit right in. My only concern is that he might outshine your groom and steal all the attention."



Phyllis eyed her skeptically, refusing to buy into the act.



An unattractive, loaded sugar daddy crashing the groom's spotlight? There was no way that could happen.



Dustin, for all his flaws,had movie-star looks-there was no denying it. If anyone was going to turn heads,it would be him, not whoever Gabriela dragged along at the last minute.



In Phyllis's mind, Gabriela was just bluffing, putting on a front for the crowd. No way could she actually pull this off.



With her own wedding only weeks away, Phyllis felt no  rush to expose Gabriela's lies-she was more than happy to let Gabriela keep up the charade. She'd see for herself soon enough what sort of man Gabriela could really find.
 ###Chapter 12 Ex-Boyfriend



The workday finally ended, and Gabriela followed Aubrey out of the building, the weight of the luxurious gift box tucked under her arm.



Aubrey's endless curiositybubbled over as they walked, peppering Gabriela with questions about her so-called boyfriend.



Heat crept up Gabriela's cheeks.



Was Brenden even her boyfriend? He was a notorious flirt, not exactly boyfriend material. All they were doing was scratching each other's backs. The only reason he'd sent that extravagant SK Elite Boutique dress was because he needed her to play the perfect date at some fancy banquet.



Realizing Gabriela wasn't in the mood to share,Aubrey let the topic drop, though her eyes still gleamed with mischief.



They reached the bus stop and settled in to wait.Suddenly, a bright red BMW slid up to the curb with a showy squeal, horn blaring in rapid bursts.



Both women turned, startled, just as the tinted window slid down. Phyllis lounged in the passenger seat, her smile bright and insincerely sweet. "Are you on your way home,Gabriela? | can give you a ride."


Before Gabriela could respond, Phyllis gave a theatrical little gasp and pressed a hand to her chest."Oh, silly me! With your new wealthy boyfriend, I'm sure regular cars aren't good enough for you anymore."



Gabriela barely spared her a glance, lips pressed in a thin,unimpressed line.



Noticing Gabriela's chilly silence, Phyllis's grin only sharpened. Clearly convinced Gabriela was bluffing about her boyfriend, she pressed harder. "If your boyfriend's so loaded,why isn't he here picking you up?Why are you standing around waiting for a bus?"



Gabriela's voice was flat and steady as she answered,"He's got work. He's busy."


Phyllis let out a smug little laugh. "Naturally-men that important must have a million people to meet every day. I guess there's no time left for his girlfriend."



As she finished, Phyllis angled herself so Gabriela and Aubrey had an unobstructed view of Dustin behind the wheel. "Not like Dustin. He always drops everything just to pick me up after work."



Dustin's grip tightened on the steering wheel the moment he spotted the SK Elite Boutique box in Gabriela's hand.



Gabriela stood quietly beside Aubrey, her beauty impossible to ignore-velvety skin, legs impossibly long, the kind of looks that made strangers stare. She could have stepped right off the pages of a fairytale Even after their breakup, Dustin couldn't shake the old feelings. Some part of him still wanted her-resentful as he was.



But Gabriela appeared to have moved on from him.She had barely ended things before flaunting a new boyfriend, and if Phyllis was right, this guy was rich-probably middle-aged,maybe even older.



What kind of young billionaire handed out gifts worth a small fortune just for fun?



The more Dustin mulled it over, the more bitter he became.He shot Phyllis a sidelong glance, voice laced with contempt. "She doesn't even appreciate it.You're wasting your energy picking her up. Seriously,you're way too soft. Just let her fend for herself."



Dustin's sneer only made Phyllis feel more pleased with herself, though she managed to mask it with a syrupy apology. "Oh, Gabriela, don't mind Dustin. He's just brutally honest. He doesn't mean anything by it."



Gabriela didn't so much as blink. "It's fine. When someone's working with such a tiny processor upstairs,it's only natural that whatever he says bypasses his brain entirely. Why would I waste my energy arguing with someone like that?"



Aubrey also leapt to Gabriela's defense. "That's right!Honestly, you two are a match made in heaven-one struts around like royalty, and the other cruises in a screaming-red BMW like it's a trophy. But here's the thing-Gabriela's SK Elite Boutique dress probably costs more than three times the price of your car. lf you're here to put on a show, you're just making fools of yourselves."



Aubrey's barbs hit harder than Gabriela's.



Phyllis's face went ashen, and Dustin's jaw clenched in rage. "Gabriela, I can't believe you've turned into such a bitter, petty person-and your friend is just as vain as you. I'm really disappointed in you."



He wrapped an arm around Phyllis and pulled away,leaving the sting of his words behind.


Aubrey blinked in disbelief, momentarily caught off guard and speechless.



"Seriously, your cousin's something else, Gabriela. So,that guy she is with-he's actually your ex? Were you always this bad at picking men, or did dating that clown scramble your standards?" A sudden heaviness pressed on Gabriela's heart.



How had she ever fallen for someone like Dustin She'd tried a hundred times to untangle the reasor but every attempt just made her mood worse-so thi time,she let it go.



Seeing Gabriela's mood suddenly drop, Aubrey waste no time to cheer her up. "Ugh, who cares about tha loser? You've totally leveled up. Let's just forge about him and focus on the real win-SK Elite Boutique! That's what I want to talk about."



She dove right in, regaling Gabriela with animatec stories about the boutique's wild popularity, anc insisted she take a million photos at the banquet to share later.



A bus rumbled up to the curb. After a round of cheerful waves, Gabriela boarded, swept into the evening rush.



By the time she made it home, the house was quiet-no sign of Phyllis. Instead, she found Josh pacing the living room



The second he spotted her, he hurried over. "Gabriela How could you suddenly leave and head back to work while you were on a blind date? And you didn't come home or pick up your phone all night! Rhys was furious.Phyllis claimed he complained about you a lot after coming home."



Gabriela steadied herself, then announced, "Uncle Josh,I have a boyfriend now."



Josh stood there, momentarily stunned, his mouth opening and closing as if searching for words. Then he snapped back to life, rattling off questions, "What's his name? What kind of work does he do?"



Just yesterday she'd been fussing about a blind date,and now she suddenly had a boyfriend? Was she just making up storiesto dodge the whole thing?



Gabriela calmly replied, "I'll bring him to Phyllis's wedding. You'll get to meet him yourself then."



That seemed to finally put Josh's suspicions at ease -at least for now.



Once she'd escaped his interrogation,Gabriela slipped away to her room and lifted the lid of the gift box.



No matter how many times Aubrey had warned her about SK Elite Boutique's jaw-dropping prices,Gabriela was still stunned when she finally saw the dress up close.



The gown was a breathtaking shade of deep blue,falling to her knees, with rows of tiny, real diamonds glittering around the hem. Wearing it was like being draped in a patch of sunlight sparkling on the ocean. She might not know much about designer labels, but even she could tell this dress cost an outrageous fortune.



A jittery thrill swept over her, quickly edged out by a prickle of anxiety she couldn't quite shake.



Once she slipped into the dress, Gabriela hesitated for a moment, then reached out to "NotASaunders" with a text. "Mr. Saunders, it's just a banquet. Did you really have to go all out on a dress like this?"

###Chapter 13 Thirty Girlfriends



The response landed in Gabriela's WhatsApp chat in the blink of an eye. "Because you deserve it."


As she read those words, her vision blurred, tears stinging her eyes before she could blink them away.



Growing up,her childhood closet had overflowed with beautiful dresses-at least, before Phyllis's family had moved in. After that, Phyllis snatched up her prettiest things,leaving Gabriela only what was outgrown or hopelessly worn.



At school,even her classmates had teased, "Gabriela,you're so lucky! Phyllis's family takes you in and gives you such nice clothes."


Whenever Gabriela tried to correct them,explaining they were all Phyllis's castoffs, she'd be instantly scolded. "You're an orphan. You should be grateful for whatever you get! Phyllis is being generous by sharing with you-stop complaining."


Phyllis, meanwhile, always put on a saintly face,stepping in with a gentle voice. "Don't say that about Gabriela. She's a girl too-it's only natural for her to want to look nice." In the end, all Gabriela ever got from others was more ridicule and contempt.



Gradually, she'd begun to accept that maybe she really was only worthy of Phyllis's hand-me-downs.


Never in her life had she imagined that one day, a well-known playboy would offer her sincere praise.


When her phone stayed silent for a few moments,another WhatsApp message popped up. "Why aren't you responding? Did you try on the dress? Does it suit you?"



Brushing away her tears with the back of her hand,Gabriela typed quickly, "Yes, I've tried it on. It's gorgeous.I love it."



Wesley's mouth quirked into a pleased,knowing smile.In his mind, anything he picked out was guaranteed to be flawless.



Gabriela, unable to contain her curiosity, responded,"It fits like it was made for me. How did you know my size?"



Wesley's gaze sharpened with a sly edge as he mused inwardly, "I have already explored every inch of you with my own hands."



The memory of that passionate night-her slender,warm body melting against his-sent a slow, burning heat through Wesley. He responded with deliberate ease, "I'm great at estimating measurements just by looking."



"That's awesome. Thank you, Mr. Saunders."



But as soon as Wesley read her reply,his mood turned stormy.



He'd handpicked that dress himself, yet she was thanking Brenden? For a split second, his jaw tightened.


Without missing a beat, he fired off a curt message."It's not a present. Just something for you to wear at the banquet. Don't read too much into it."



Gabriela paused, thumbs hovering over the screen,bewildered.



What was going on? Had she somehow managed to offend him?



With all the praise and thanks she'd given,what could possibly have him so upset? Was her gratitude too vague? Or did he expect something more?



Wesley grew annoyed when she didn't answer with the apology he was waiting for. With a calm but cold expression, he inhaled deeply and hit send on a new message. "A dress isn't a big deal. I've bought diamond necklaces and luxury jewelry for my thirty girlfriends."



His words landed like a cold slap, blatantly implying that Brenden spoiled his girlfriends with far grander tokens and that Gabriela had no reason to feel special.



Gabriela's mind reeled.



She'd always heard whispers about Brenden's endless string of flings, but thirty girlfriends? Was that even possible?



Her thoughts snagged on the memory of that hotel room-the feel of his hard, sculpted muscles beneath her hands, the fierce, greedy way he'd pulled her close.Heat flooded her cheeks despite herself.


Yet underneath that lingering warmth, an uneasy ache twisted in her chest.



Even so, she couldn't deny it-just thinking about the way he'd gripped her so fiercely and kissed her that night sent a little thrill racing through her chest.


She snapped back a bold reply. "You're absolutely right, Mr. Saunders. You really do have deep pockets Hope your girlfriends will stick around to help you spend every last cent."



Wesley read.her comeback and knew, with a quiet satisfaction, that he'd managed to erase whatever  fondness Gabriela might have felt for Brenden. The realization made his lips curve into a subtle, contented smile.



He tapped out a message, measured and calm."The banquet's about to begin. Stay put. I'll come get you."


Billy, glancing at Wesley in the rearview mirror,noticed the sudden ease in his boss's expression and silently let out the breath he'd been holding.



Just moments ago,Wesley's thunderous mood,fueled by the tense messages on his phone, had cast a heavy chill over the entire car.



Gathering his courage, Billy asked in a coreful tone,"Shall we make our way to the banquet now, Mr.iloss?"
###Chapter 14 You Really Shouldn't Stoop This Low

Wesley glanced at Billy and remarked, "We'll make a quick stop at Rosemont Gardens. I need to pick someone up."



Billy shot him a puzzled look in the rearview mirror.Who in the world could possibly be so significant that Wesley himself would show up at their door?



Rosemont Gardens wasn't exactly exclusive-just a cluster of tastefully bland homes for the comfortably well-off.It was hardly the sort of place that drew VIPs.Still, someone there had managed to snag Wesley's personal attention.



He didn't voice the question,just eased the car around with a silent nod and headed off.



Meanwhile, Gabriela glanced at her phone and shot off a brisk "Okay" to "NotASaunders" before tossing the device onto the table.



She knew she didn't care about Brenden, not really Yet somehow,his text still managed to upset her.


Frustration simmering just beneath the surface,Gabriela dusted on a quick layer of makeup, snatched  up her purse, and strode downstairs.



The second she pushed through the door, a sharp December breeze whipped against her cheeks.



Her thin dress did nothing to keep out the chill, and she instinctively hunched her shoulders,grateful she'd thought to bring a coat.



She had just started to shrug it on when Phyllis reappeared,practically glued to Dustin's side, parading her affection for everyone to see.



Gabriela breezed past them without so much as a glance, determined not to acknowledge their presence.


Still, Phyllis's sharp gaze locked onto the deep blue dress hugging Gabriela's figure-a rare edition she'd only ever admired in glossy magazine spreads,rumored to cost a jaw-dropping seven figures.


Jealousy flickered in Phyllis's eyes, but with Dustin at her side, she kept her envy tightly masked. She affected a gentle tone and called out, "Gabriela, are you going on a date with your boyfriend tonight? It's freezing out. No matter how much you want to turn heads,you really should cover up a little."



The words slid from her lips like honey,but the dig was razor sharp, aimed directly at Gabriela's bare shoulders and luminous, delicate skin-so flawless it seemed to give off its own soft glow, infuriatingly gorgeous.



When Phyllis saw Dustin's lingering gaze on Gabriela,she was filled with resentment. Dustin couldn't peel his eyes away from Gabriela, his gaze openly tracing every line of her exposed skin, barely disguising his desire.



That coat draped over Gabriela's arm appeared cheap,but the aura she radiated-carrying herself with effortless confidence-transformed it into a statement piece, giving her the poise of modern royalty.


Flashing a sugar-sweet smile, Gabriela replied, "No worries. My boyfriend's taking me out to an exclusive event tonight. Central heating and all-I'll be perfectly cozy."



Though she wasn't dating Brenden, Gabriela could play the part of a high-society girlfriend as smoothly as anyone.


Phyllis's expression soured. She leaned closer to Dustin, her tone dripping with contempt. "Gabriela's found herself a wealthy boyfriend, but won't even introduce him to the family. I'm honestly concerned she's fallen for some creepy older guy. Just yesterday,I tried to set her up with my mentor's son-a respectable, well-educated man. She practically

turned her nose up and even offended him! | guess |was just mneddling in things that aren't my business after all."



Dustin, never one to question what he was told,recalled the words Gabriela's colleague had said earlier.His jaw tightened in obvious irritation. "Gabriela,I know l've messed up and hurt you before, but you really shouldn't stoop this low. I'm honestly disappointed in you."



Who did this arrogant clown thini he was, lecturing her like he had any right?



In that instant, Gabriela found herself oddly grateful to Phyllis-at least now she saw Dustin's true nature with crystal clarity.



"My boyfriend isn't just wealthier than you-he's taller,better looking, and, best of all, he knows how to stay loyal.He won't cheat on me.Honestly, dating you was me stooping way too low."



She flashed a breezy, dazzling smile as she finished,watching with satisfaction as both Dustin's and Phyllis's faces dropped.



Were her barbs so sharp that they struck a nerve with them? She hadn't thought they'd both look so utterly floored.



As Gabriela took in their stunned silence, she caught their wide-eyed stares-only to realize they weren't even looking at her anymore.



She spun around and spotted a sleek black Rolls-Royce pulled up at the curb, accompanied by a cluster of towering bodyguards.



The whole scene radiated such quiet menace,no one in their right mind would dare approach.
###Chapter 15 Accompanying Wesley To The Party

A bodyguard in a crisp black suit addressed Gabriela with practiced courtesy. "Miss Haynes, please get in the car. Our boss is waiting for you."


Surprise hit Gabriela like a sudden jolt, freezing her in place.



Did Brenden really get here that fast? Had he overheard everything she'd just said?



She suddenly felt a twinge of embarrassment.



Meanwhile, Phyllis's sharp gaze lingered on the gleaming Rolls-Royce. It was a rare, limited-edition model-easily worth twenty times what Dustin's flashy BMW cost.



She drifted closer, straining her neck in hopes of spotting the man inside.



But the tinted glass was pitch black; nothing inside was visible.



The air of secrecy only fueled Phyllis's suspicions.He had to be some seedy old sugar daddy. Determined, Phyllis tried to circle around for a better look at the driver's side. Instantly, two hulking bodyguards intercepted her, their stony faces radiating silent warning. With one synchronized step, they blocked her path-making it abundantly clear she wasn't getting anywhere near that car.



Phyllis went rigid, her pulse skittering as the intimidating guards exchanged their stony glares for deference,bowing their heads and swinging the door wide for Gabriela like she was royalty.


Bitterness and envy twisted beneath Phyllis's ribs,so fierce she almost mangled the polished handle of her purse.



There was no way a guy with this kindof money and devotion was some spoiled, cocky rich kid. He had to be a withered old creep, someone hideous and lecherous,right?



Despite Gabriela's beauty, in the end, she'd just wind up a discarded toy-nothing but a temporary plaything for some old, predatory man until he grew tired of her.


"Phyllis, come on, quit gawking," Dustin murmured,slipping his arms around her waist. "Gabriela's made her choice. All your worrying won't change a thing-she doesn't even want your concern."



Phyllis smoothed away every trace of jealousy,  slipping on an elegant smile as she inclined her head."You're right. I'm a bit worn out. Let's just head home."



Dustin leaned in, his voice a gentle murmur. "You really do need your rest. You know how delicate your health's been lately..."



Meanwhile,Gabriela barely spared the loving couple a glance. Their over-the-top act wasn't worth her attention.



Right now, she was preoccupied with something else.Once she settled into the car, she spotted Wesley waiting inside, which sent an electric jolt through her.


She stammered, "Um, Mr. Moss? What are you doing here?"



After being stuck at the office all night and somehow winding up in Wesley's bed, she was still rattled, and the last thing she wanted was another encounter with him.



Yet fate, or bad luck, had her climbing into his car all over again, nerves tingling beneath her skin.



Wesley's gaze flicked toward her, lingering on the exposed skin of her shoulders before a faint crease formed between his brows.



Gabriela couldn't read the subtle shift in his expression,but his voice was level as he queried, "So, you're my  date for tonight?"



The realization hit her-Brenden had set her up as Wesley's companion for the evening.



Given how detached Wesley seemed, she could tell he was unbothered by the fact that she had hogged his bed last night.



She straightened, offering a polite nod. "Yes, Mr. Moss.You've got nothing to worry about-I will behave appropriately at the party."



With the briefest nod, Wesley murmured a word to Billy, who quietly turned up the heat.


Enveloped in the car's growing warmth, Gabriela mused that Wesley was truly considerate.



His attention slid to the coat bundled in her arms.After a glance at his watch, he instructed Billy, "Take us to the styling studio first."



"Right away, sir," Billy answered, keeping his face stoic even as disbelief sent his thoughts reeling.



Gabriela was just an intern, wasn't she? Yet here was Wesley himself, showing up to bring her along.



As for the dress she was wearing--Billy had watched Wesley spend nearly an hour with the designer,making sure every stitch fit her like it was custom-  made.



Just last night, she'd been working late alongside Wesley,and now it seemed she'd already captured his attention.



It seemed Wesley was drawn to hardworking girls with quiet manners, never to spoiled heiresses who batted their lashes and expected to coast on their parents 'money.



Billy kept his composure, quietly wrestling with his swirling thoughts as he navigated the city streets and pulled up to the styling studio.



Inside,Gabriela found herself swept into the middle of a whirlwind, A small army of stylists, every one of them impeccably dressed, bustled around her with brushes and designer palettes.



The lead stylist grinned as he worked, barely able to hide his excitement. "Miss Haynes, your skin is absolutely radiant. And your figure-honestly, it's flawless. I guarantee, you're about to steal the show tonight."



Gabriela caught a glimpse of the studio's logo and,remembering Aubrey's endless gossip, realized she was standing in the very same place that prepped all the A-list celebrities.


 
Apparently, this was just business as usual for the ultra  -wealthy: turning a simple banquet into a full-blown production.



When the team finally stepped back, Gabriela barely recognized herself in the mirror. Her reflection shimmered-polished,poised,every detail immaculate.



Compliments from the stylists poured in from every direction, each one more flattering than the last.



Yet beneath the glamorous transformation, Gabriela felt a twist of nerves. She wasn't sure she could handle being the center of attention at the party.



Wesley strode over, pausing for a second as he took in how stunning Gabriela looked beneath the soft lights. His eyes lingered appreciatively before he offered a rare nod of approval. "You look great."



Every trace of nervousness slipped away from Gabriela before she knew it.


Wesley had actually given her a compliment!


A fresh sense of resolve lit up inside her; tonight,she'd prove she deserved his recognition.



Still, after sliding into the backseat, she couldn't quite shake her nerves.



Wesley's imposing energy filled the car, making every breath feel deliberate. Even after those handful of awkward encounters, she still felt small in his presence.



She reached up and fidgeted with the delicate scarf,the one Wesley himself had ordered for her outfit, and tried to shrink into the shadows by the window. Maybe if she kept quiet, she could disappear for a little while.


But Wesley, seemingly in good spirits, glanced her way and broke the silence. "What do you think of Brenden?"

###Chapter 16 You Have A Kitten At Your Place
At the question, Gabriela straightened up, posture suddenly rigid and alert.



Though Brenden had just been demoted,whispers claimed he was related to Wesley.



She wouldn't risk criticizing Brenden in front of Wesley,so she forced a strained smile. "Honestly, he's actually a pretty decent guy."



Wesley's gentle façade vanished in an instant, his face clouding over. "Decent? How so?"



He had already tried to sway her opinion of Brenden by sharing details about his womanizing ways. So why didn't she seem bothered by it at all?



Gabriela's heart hammered wildly as nerves took over.



Maybe her answer had been too vague. Was he annoyed?



She scrambled for something more convincing. "Mr.Saunders is attractive, and he's always polite, very attentive, and honestly, he's quite generous." She had delicately avoided talking about his playboy ways. There was no way she'd slip up again.



Instead,Wesley's features turned even colder,his tone clipped and unreadable. "You've got the worst judgment when it comes to people."



Tension pressed down inside the car, leaving Gabriela's knees weak and her heart fluttering in her chest.



She slid closer to the window, practically melding into the cold glass, desperate for distance.



Being chastised by Wesley upset her.



She suspected this was his way of venting his frustration over her hogging his bed last night.



A sudden realization hit her like a lightning bolt.Maybe Wesley was just one of those people who woke up cranky, and his bad mood was finally catching up with him.



As Gabriela let her thoughts drift, Wesley's sharp voice cut through the silence."Why are you sitting all the way over there?"



She hesitated, then grudgingly scooted closer.


At that moment, Billy stomped on the brakes. The car  jerked violently, nearly throwing her into the seat in front of her-until Wesley's arm shot out, catching her and yanking her safely back.



She tumbled straight into his arms, her cheek brushing the cool, tailored fabric of his suit jacket. Wesley's heartbeat thudded strong and steady beneath her ear,radiating a warmth that sent a wave of déjà vu through her. For a moment, she just sat there,momentarily caught off guard by how natural it felt.



She tilted her head up, meeting Wesley's gaze.His eyes locked onto hers, dark and intense, as if he was struggling to mask something deeper beneath that calm exterior.



Up close, he was impossibly handsome-every line of his face sharper, every feature more striking under the car's dim interior light.



Gabriela found herself frozen, caught by the magnetic pull of his presence.


Wesley snapped out of it first, a hint of restraint flickering across his features as he demanded, "What's going on?"



Billy, already half out of the car, glanced back."There's a pileup up ahead. I'll take a look," he swiftly answered, disappearing into the night.


Still tucked securely against Wesley's chest, Gabriela  struggled to steady her breathing, her mind spinning with questions.


Why did his embrace feel so inexplicably familiar? It reminded her of how Brenden had held her during their one-night stand.



Just as she tried to collect herself, Wesley leaned closer, his voice dropping to a teasing rumble.my arms really that comfortable?"



Gabriela jolted upright, but in her panicked scramble,her hand collided with his manhood, which felt firm and unmistakably tense beneath her palm.



A shadow flickered across Wesley's face, his eyes turning dangerously dark.



Heat surged up Gabriela's neck, flushing her cheeks an impossible shade of red.



"S-sorry!" she sputtered, tripping over her own tongue.



Wesley sucked in a quiet breath through his teeth, the sound sharp and unmistakable. Gabriela, mortified,murmured softly, "Did I hurt you?"



Maybe she'd hit him harder than she realized. God,could she have actually caused some pain?



Wesley glanced down at her, his gaze inscrutable. "No,it's just that I have a few scratches on my back," he  said, his voice cool but laced with an odd fondness."A kitten got to me a few days ago."



The corner of his mouth twitched, betraying the faintest hint of amusement-even as he spoke of scratches, he didn't sound upset at all.



Gabriela's surprise slipped out before she could stop herself. "You have a kitten at your place?"



The question seemed to catch him off guard, and for a second, his annoyance broke through. "I haven't brought it back yet."



So it wasn't his cat-probably some stray.



Her eyes grew wide as she went on,"Wait-you got scratched by a stray cat? Stray cats can carry all kinds of viruses. Did you get it checked out? At least get a shot?"



Wesley responded with a chilly, dismissive laugh, "I don't need a doctor."



His irritation seemed to thicken the tension in the car,making the air feel even more suffocating. Gabriela found herself edging back, hoping to put some distance between them.



Just how many times could this man's mood swing in a single car ride? Dealing with rich people really took a special kind of endurance. A moment later, Billy climbed back inside, a trace of relief on his face as he reported, "Mr. Moss, there's a minor accident up ahead. We'll have to take a different route."



Wesley nodded, his tone steady and detached. "Fine.Do it."



However, the detour delayed them so much that they were the last guests to step into the banquet hall.



Yet with Wesley's imposing reputation, nobody dared utter a word about their late entrance. Instead, the crowd's attention locked onto the striking woman at his side, whispers swirling as they tried to guess her identity.



The event took place at the Sapphire Valley Hotel, a glittering behemoth of luxury towering over the city skyline.



But Gabriela hardly noticed the opulence-she was too tense, still feeling the chill of Wesley's lingering displeasure.



Wesley surged ahead, his long legs eating up the distance. Gabriela had to almost jog to match his relentless pace, her heels clicking frantically on the polished floor.



Before she could catch her breath, he stopped short She plowed straight into his broad back, nearly flattening her nose against his tailored suit.



Wincing,she clapped a hand over her face and hurried out an apology.



Wesley's mood seemed to have mellowed; he glanced over his shoulder and asked, "Did it hurt?"



Gabriela bobbed her head,half-expecting a hint of sympathy, but all Wesley offered was a single, biting word."Clumsy."



Left utterly speechless, Gabriela realized his brief kindness had only been a setup for anotherjab at her.



The man she'd once admired for his reserved and noble demeanor now struck her as petulant, even petty, his dignity slipping to reveal a streak of childish vindictiveness.



Before she could open her mouth to say something,Gabriela noticed every pair of eyes in the room fixed on her.

###Chapter 17 The Most Handsome Man On The...
Gabriela had never set foot in an event like this before.Surrounded by curious stares, she felt an unfamiliar tightness in her chest.



Wesley offered his arm, a silent invitation. "You don't need to be nervous," he murmured, his voice steady and low.



She slid her hand into the crook of his arm,her fingers clinging a little tighter than necessary.


In that moment, the distant, untouchable Wesley-so often a cold,intimidating presence-suddenly radiated a quiet strength she could lean on.



Standing beside him, she felt an unexpected calm,as if his presence alone could shield her from anything the night might throw her way.



As they stepped into the venue, Gabriela was hit by the scale of the occasion. The air crackled with glamour and ambition.



Tycoons she'd only glimpsed in glossy magazines mingled with A-list celebrities, famous faces from the silver screen gliding past in a blur of couture and diamonds. Everywhere she looked, she caught flashes of star power, dazzling and surreal, leaving her a little breathless as she tried to take it all in.



Wesley led Gabriela from one prominent figure in the business world to the next, pausing just long enough for polite introductions before moving on.



She found herself face-to-face with the CEO of a household appliance giant-his products notorious for being both outrageously pricey and somehow everywhere. He looked younger than she'd expected,though his thinning hair betrayed a few late nights and too many board meetings.



Next was the wife of a powerful man, radiant in a designer gown that shimmered beneath the chandeliers. The necklace at her throat-surely the same one tabloids claimed she'd dropped a fortune on -flashed like a lighthouse every time she laughed,drawing every eye in the room.



Gabriela could barely keep up, swept along as Wesley navigated the crowd with effortless authority.He barely lingered, offering quick, almost perfunctory introductions-his attention reserved,his conversation short.



Only when they reached another businessman did Wesley's posture straighten and his tone grow formal A steel-gray suit sharpened the man's lean frame. He looked to be around sixty, not especially tall, silver hair swept neatly back from a face carved with deep lines, though something gentle softened his gaze.



Gabriela recognized who he was at once. All that time spent studying up on Alphacom Electronics paid off -this was Mason Garner, the CEO himself.


A jolt of surprise ran through her.



Just this morning, she and Aubrey had brainstormed ways to connect with anyone from Alphacom's top executives. Yet now, here she was, with Wesley standing beside her, personally introducing her to Mason.



Mason's eyes crinkled in genuine warmth as he greeted Wesley. There wasn't a hint of the thinly veiled superiority older executives often showed the younger set-only sincere respect in his tone.


After a brief exchange of pleasantries, Wesley smoothly turned his attention back to Gabriela.



With an easy smile, Mason glanced over. "Aren't you going to introduce the lovely woman on your arm?"



Gabriela tensed,heart fluttering as Wesley replied with practiced calm, "This is Gabriela Haynes-she works for my company. She's joining me tonight as my companion."



He didn't clarify her position, but every executive in the room immediately picked up on the implication.



Wesley had never taken a woman to an event like this before, indicating that there was more between them than simply a professional relationship.



Mason's demeanor softened even further, and he offered Gabriela an effusive stream of compliments -calling her bright, capable, and striking.



Gabriela met his gaze, her voice sincere. "You're t00kind, Mr. Garner. I still have a lot to learn."



Mason,clearly picking up on Wesley's desire to groom Gabriela, struck up a long, friendly conversation with her. By the end, he offered his number and even floated the idea of grabbing dinner together sometime.



To Gabriela, it felt like the chance to secure a billion -dollar partnership with him was winking at her.



In the end, Mason only left after Wesley made a casual promise to have dinner together soon.








Slipping Mason's business card into her purse, Gabriela dutifully trailed after Wesley, shaking hands with one  industry titan after another until her cheeks began to ache from nonstop smiling.



All at once, she spotted a familiar face up ahead-Vincent Atkinson, the movie star everyone recognized on sight.



A rush of delight bubbled up inside Gabriela



She'd adored Vincent's films for years-catching a glimpse of her idol here, of all places, felt unreal.


Tonight's banquet had already paid off in spades; luck like this only came around once in a lifetime.


Gabriela held back her thrill. Under any other circumstances, she'd have dashed across the room,grinning, eager for a quick photo and an autograph from Vincent.



A low, teasing voice brushed her ear. "So you think he's good-looking?"



Gabriela's eyes sparkled as she nodded, unable to hide her giddy grin



The voice dipped. "What's so attractive about him?"


Gabriela didn't miss a beat. "Vincent Atkinson is my idol! I never imagined he'd be even more striking in real life. He's tall, magnetic,just...wow." 
But the second the words left her lips, an icy draft seemed to sweep over her.



She glanced up, and sure enough, Wesley's expression had darkened,his jaw tight.



She faltered, nerves creeping into her voice.Moss?"



Wesley's eyes narrowed. "So, who's better looking-me or him?"



The answer was obvious-especially when he looked that irritated. Gabriela offered her brightest smile and poured on the flattery. "Are you kidding? No contest at all, Mr. Moss. You're in a league of your own-the most handsome man on the planet!"

###Chapter 18 Jealousy



Wesley gave a short, frosty laugh. "Focus on your job.And keep your eyes off every other man in the room."



Gabriela seethed silently. He really did have a short fuse-and the jealousy to match.



She masked her annoyance behind a dazzling,innocent smile. "You're way too handsome, Mr. Moss.If I get to see your face every day, how could I even notice anyone else?"


Wesley gave another dry snort. "Do you really mean that, or is this just flattery?"



She kept laying on the compliments until his mood finally thawed.



Just then, one of Wesley's business associates appeared.



He turned to Gabriela and said, "Find somewhere out of the way and stay there. I'll come get you when I'm finished."



Gabriela promised she'd behave, then wandered off,eager to escape and finally snag a plate of food.



She barely had time to settle in before a sneering voice cut through the air. "So, you're Mr. Moss's date for tonight? You've got charm and beauty; it's no wonder he's into you."



Gabriela turned around and found herself face-to-face with an attractive woman whose eyes were blazing with irritation.



It took a moment before she realized the woman was none other than the A-list celebority Claire Houghton.



Gabriela knew she was captivating, but hearing such praise from someone who treated herself as the gold standard of beauty? That was a rare treat.



She couldn't help but smile, her tone warm but not overly sweet. "That's a big compliment. Thanks."


Claire clearly hadn't expected such an easygoing response. For a split second, her poise slipped, and surprise flickered across her face.



The truth was, she had been in a bad mood all evening.Her entire styling squad had been whisked away at the last minute-supposedly to handle Gabriela's transformation.



And to top it off, Wesley, notorious for his cold distance from women, had shown up with Gabriela on his arm. Worse yet, he'd snatched Claire's prized stylist team just for her. The slight was impossible to ignore. Over the years, Claire had exhausted every trick she could think of to capture Wesley's attention. She'd put on a show of dizziness, staged dramatic tumbles,and even once sprained her ankle in a desperate bid for sympathy-yet Wesley had never so much as spared her a second glance. Each failed attempt only fueled her frustration.



Now, as she watched Wesley parade around the room with a nobody like Gabriela, Claire's resentment burned hotter than ever.



All evening, she'd been seething, just waiting for a chance to put Gabriela in her place. At last, she cornered Gabriela by herself, every line prepared-only to be thrown by how calmly Gabriela met her gaze. It appeared that Wesley's support boosted her confidence.The audacity was staggering.



Brushing back her hair with disdain, Claire sneered, "Do you know who l am?"



Gabriela's smile stayed flawless as she replied, "Of course I do. That show you starred in was huge.Actually,one of my coworkers is obsessed."



"So you know exactly who I am,and you still have the guts to act like this?" Claire arched her neck,radiating smugness, as if she was bestowing Gabriela with the honor of an apology. Gabriela was unfazed, her tone remaining sincere "You paid me a compliment, and I thanked you.That's just good manners, isn't it?"


Rage spread across Claire's face, coloring it deep red.



Was Gabriela mocking her-implying she didn't know the first thing about manners?



How could Gabriela act so superior? Was Wesley so smitten with her that she felt she could throw her weight around?



For a split second, Claire hesitated, thrown off by the possibility that Gabriela meant more to Wesley than she'd realized. Irritated, she spat on the floor, fixed Gabriela with a piercing glare, and spun on her heel.



Pulling out her phone, Claire scrolled to a WhatsApp contact, transferred a sum of money,and typed,"Find out everything there is to know about Gabriela Haynes."


The reply came almost instantly. "Consider it done."



Gabriela couldn't be bothered by Claire's sour glare.All she could think was that Claire's so-called otherworldly beauty seemed ordinary now that she had seen it up close.



She couldn't wait to share that little detail with Aubrey later. Then Gabriela turned her attention to the food.



One bite was perfectly savory, the next sweet, the following one crisp and golden-she sampled everything with reckless abandon.


Eventually,she realized she'd overdone it.


Now she was stuffed to the point of discomfort, her stomach tight and bloated. Rubbing her middle, she glanced across the room and caught sight of Wesley.


He was surrounded by a cluster of well-dressed guests, but he seemed to stand apart from the crowd,drawing every eye in the room with that magnetic presence.



Even from a distance, he radiated authority,his profile sharper and more striking than anyone else's-even Vincent, the movie star, couldn't hold a candle to him.



Gabriela secretly wondered who would be deserving enough to stand beside him as his wife in the future.



Still a little dazed from her brief fangirl high, she gave her rounded belly a gentle pat and slipped quietly into the garden for a stroll.



The hotel's garden sprawled before her,dominated by a glimmering pool and cascading artificial waterfalls.Despite the chill of winter in the air, flowers bloomed everywhere,lush and impossibly vibrant.



The extravagance here was on a whole different level -being rich really did rewrite the laws of nature.



She wandered between beds of color, admiring petals sparkling with frost. "How do you manage to bloom like this in the dead of winter?" she murmured, half-talking to the pampered flowers, half marveling at the absurdity of it all.



Just then, her phone vibrated sharply in her hand.



Anew message flashed on her screen. "Where are you?"



It was from "NotASaunders."



She textedback immediately, "In the garden."



The reply shot back almost at once, the tone clipped and unmistakably irked. "I brought you as my date, and here you are,sneaking off?"



Gabriela blinked, puzzled. Brenden didn't attend the banquet at all. How could he be so well-informed about her every move?



She rushed through her explanation. "I ate too much.Just needed a walk to settle my stomach."



After a few quiet moments, an unexpected message popped up. "So, what do you think of Mr. Moss?"
Gabriela instantly straightened, her curiosity piqued.


Wasn't this almost the exact question Wesley had tossed her way about Brenden earlier, back in the car?


Now it felt like she'd stumbled into some secret game where they were sizing up her loyalty.



Determined not to let anyone trip her up, Gabriela's fingers danced across her phone as she fired back."Mr. Moss is outrageously handsome! You should see it for yourself-every woman here is staring at him.Even Claire, who's supposedly the top beauty in the business, can't keep her eyes off him."



Worried her praise still wasn't enough, she immediately added, "Honestly, I think he's the most attractive man in the event. Even the movie star Vincent doesn't come close."
###Chapter 19 His Flaw



"NotASaunders" sent another message that carried a clear note of skepticism. "So Mr. Moss doesn't have any flaws whatsoever?"



Desperate to come up with a harmless flaw, Gabriela typed,"Well, his legs are ridiculously long. He always walks so fast that I'm left chasing after him. Does that even count as a flaw?"



She hit send and stared at her screen, waiting for any sign of a reply. Seconds dragged into minutes, but her phone stayed stubbornly silent.


Meanwhile, Wesley slipped his phone into his pocket,quietly excusing himself from a businessman who tried to strike up conversation, and made his way toward the garden.



Billy trailed after him, unable to hide his astonishment.



All evening, Wesley had kept one eye on his phone,and just a moment ago, Billy could've sworn he saw the man actually smiling at the screen.



This was utterly unthinkable. Wesley, known for his icy,no-nonsense demeanor, had smiled in a message? Was lhe really falling for someone? It would certainly explain why his moods tonight had swung so wildly.clear skies one moment, thunderclouds the inext.



But who could this extraordinary woman be-the one who thawed his glacial heart?



Lost in thought, Billy was startled when Wesley's cool voice cut through the silence. "Take the car and go.Make sure the guards leave,too."



Billy blinked in disbelief. In all his years at Wesley's side,he'd never heard such a strange command."Sir,if I drive off,how will you get home?"



Wesley's calm gaze never wavered, brooking no argument. Billy swallowed, gave a crisp nod, and hurried out,leading the bodyguards away as instructed.



Out in the moonlit garden, Gabriela was still quietly admiring the winter flowers when a familiar, low voice reached her. "Gabriela.”



She turned and saw Wesley moving through the shadows,his posture relaxed, his presence impossibly magnetic in the chilly night air.



He was irresistibly breathtaking.



Gabriela's heart responded with a tender flutter she couldn't ignore. "Time to go," Wesley said simply.


Only then did Gabriela realize the banquet had ended.


She trailed after him to the hotel entrance-only to find the driveway empty, the expected car nowhere to be found.



"The car broke down," Wesley announced in a steady tone."I've sent it for repairs. We'll have to grab a taxi out front."



Gabriela almost blurted out her disbelief.



She'd spotted at least two other luxury sedans tailing them earlier-how could he lie so smoothly, without the faintest flicker of guilt?


Still, she didn't dare challenge him, not when just holding his gaze made her palms sweat. Forcing a bright, breezy smile, she trailed after him as if everything was perfectly normal.



It was well past eleven. The city had slipped into a hush,and the nearly deserted street seemed to belong to them alone.



As they strolled side by side, their shadows stretched across the pavement, tangled together in the golden streetlight-a scene so gentle and quiet it almost felt stolen. Gabriela gradually realized something was off.Wesley,who usually outpaced everyone with those impossibly long strides, had slowed down to a pace even she could manage in high heels. More than once, she found herself pausing and glancing back, only to see him lagging behind.



She recalled him complaining earlier in the car about getting scratched by a cat, and her worry bubbled up."Is your back still sore, Mr. Moss? Is that why you're walking so slowly tonight?"



Wesley shot her a sidelong look, his eyes unreadable."You have a problem with the way I walk?"


The question caught Gabriela off guard.



She stared at him, momentarily thrown. Then the realization struck-Wesley had gotten jealous about Vincent earlier. Vincent had starred in a classic film,strolling in slow motion to dramatic music, exuding effortless cool.



Could Wesley actually be competing with Vincent's charm?



Gabriela nearly laughed out loud as the realization dawned on her.



So men cared about appearances just as much as women did-maybe even more. She threw him a reassuring smile. "Honestly, I think you look great no matter how you walk, Mr. Moss."


Wesley stopped abruptly, pinning her in place with a look both sharp and unreadable. After a moment, his lips curled in a wry half-smile. "You little liar."


For a second, Gabriela forgot how to breathe.Was she really that easy to read?



She fumbled for another charming reply, but her mind drew a blank. Embarrassed, she just let the silence settle between them, the hush deepening under the streetlights.



Then, out of nowhere, Wesley's tone softened as he asked, "You did well tonight. Is there anything you want?"



That question snapped her out of it. Gabriela's head shot up, eyes suddenly bright with anticipation. "What do you mean, Mr. Moss?"



Was he offering her a raise? Or maybe he intended to help her close that enormous deal with Mason?



"Whatever you wish for, just tell me-I'll make it happen for you." Wesley studied her, his eyes shining with an odd sort of patience, as if silently urging her to say whatever she truly wanted. Gabriela wavered, uncertainty flickering across her face. After a brief pause, she gathered her courage."Um... once my internship ends, is there a chance l could officially join the company?"



Wesley's features went cold in an instant, a thundercloud settling over his expression. "That's it?That's all you want?"


His reaction rattled her. Gabriela's heart dropped, and a sharp wave of regret rushed in. Of course he'd caught her playing it safe-he'd probably meant for her to reach for something bolder, and instead she'd exposed herself as yet another intern angling for a shortcut.



No wonder he dominated the business world-he could read people with a glance and see straight through every ploy.



Panic welled up inside her as she realized the damage was likely done. That was the end of her hopes to become a full-time employee.



Desperate, Gabriela scrambled to fix her mistake. "I swear,Mr.Moss-I'll prove myself.I'll work harder than anyone, earn my spot here, and give everything I've got to this company!"



He fixed his gaze on her, brows drawn in wary disbelief. "Seriously? That's it? You're sure you don't want anything else?"



Noticing the way he hovered, clearly expecting her to ask for more, Gabriela hesitated, then lowered her voice. "Actually, since it's freezing and already way past midnight... do you think I could get paid double overtime?"



His expression didn't budge as he queried,"You really think tonight qualifies as overtime?"


Wasn't it? Gabriela blinked, momentarily thrown off by the question.



His features remained perfectly composed, his voice flat,but underneath, Gabriela sensed a storm brewing.


He was genuinely furious and no amount of sweet talk could even hope to thaw him.



She gazed at his imposing, broad-shouldered silhouette and felt a sinking feeling grip her.


Truthfully,he was acting ridiculously petty.



The moment she brought up money, his mood detonated. Of course he'd be ruthless-he hadn't clawed his way to the top of the business world for nothing.



And this was the legend who supposedly made millions every minute? Apparently, just mentioning overtime pay was enough to strike a nerve.
###Chapter 20 Delivering Breakfast To Wesley
Wesley paused and glanced back, catching sight of Gabriela trailing further and further behind, her gaze flitting anxiously, clearly miles away in her own thoughts.



He shot her a look of irritation as he remarked, "I'll have Billy drive you home."


Without missing a beat, Gabriela blurted out,"Didn't you already have him send your car in for repairs, Mr.Moss?"



Wesley's face chilled, the corners of his mouth twitching. "I keep a spare."



A short while later, Gabriela found herself tucked into the plush back seat of the backup car, with Billy himself at the wheel. She offered Wesley a courteous farewell before the car slipped away from the curb.



As the city lights flickered past her window, curiosity finally won out. "Mr. Clarke, can I ask you something?"


Billy glanced up in the rearview mirror, his tone gentle and reassuring."Of course, Miss Haynes. What would you like to know?" Cabriela hesitated momertarily struck by how everyone in Wesley's orbit seemed unfailingly polite -no matter the hour, they treated their colleagues with a kind of old-school respect mhat telt out of place in her world



"Exactly how many cars does Mr. Moss ovin?" she ventured, lowaring her voice.



Billy chuckled, completely unbothered,	。not couniing what ha's got parked at his family estate.there are maybe seven or eight around here."



Gabrlala barely stifled a grumble, WVesley had so much money he could scatter luxury cars across the city-yet he still pinched pennies when it came to her overtime pay.



Honestly, what a cheapskate.



Back at Rosemont Gardens, Gabriela offered Billy a quick, grateful nod before climbing out of the car. She barely got her footing before she spotted Phyllis dragging Dustin along and craning her neckto peer into the back seat



Gabriela immediately saw through the act, rolled her ayes inwardly, and walked right past her without a word



Yet Phyllis stapped in front of her, feigning concern while openly sizing Gabriela up. "Why are you getting home this late, Gabriela? Shouldn't your boyfriend be a gentleman and walk you to the door?"



With a breezy shrug, Gabriela responded, "I'd rather not. There's someone here who loves to steal other people's men." She flashed a light, teasing grin as she went on, "My boyfriend's quite the catch. I'd hate for anyone to get ideas, so I'm keeping him out of sight."



Phyllis's lips twisted into a sulk, her eyes turning teary as she looked at Dustin and murmured in a vulnerable tone, "I'm just worried about you. Why are you being so hostile toward me?"



Dustin's jaw tightened, his irritation obvious as he shot Gabriela a stern look. "Gabriela, we've explained everything already. Why do you insist on stirring things up?"



Gabriela crossed her arms, coolly retorting, "Maybe try getting the story straight for once. Phyllis is the one making a scene, not me."



A sly smile tugged at Gabriela's lips as she added,"Honestly, I hope you two last forever. Let's just keep our distance-otherwise, Phyllis might start thinking you're following in her footsteps, juggling more than one person at a time."



Back in high school, everyone had gossiped nonstop  when Dustin chased after Gabriela. He'd marched right into the middle of the campus with a dramatic bouquet of roses, boldly declaring his feelings for her in front of a crowd.



Gabriela had only ever felt a flicker of interest in him,but with so many eyes watching, she couldn't bring herself to shoot him down and embarrass him in public.



Just like that, her first relationship kicked off. But Gabriela's heart had never been in it, not really.



So when Dustin's betrayal finally came to light,she barely gave it a day's thought. Why the hell would she waste time mourning a jerk like that?



After putting that shameless pair in their place,Gabriela felt like a weight had lifted off her shoulders.At this point, even Wesley's refusal to pay her overtime couldn't dampen her spirits.



Once Gabriela had finished washing up and scrubbing away the last traces of her makeup, she tossed a wary glance at that over-the-top gown glimmering in the corner.Without a second thought, she fired off a message to "NotASaunders" on WhatsApp.



She wrote, "Mr. Saunders, tonight's banquet wrapped up smoothly. I'd like to return the dress-could you send me an address?" A beat later, his answer popped up, short and dismissive. "No need."



The blunt response sent a quick flutter through her chest.



Uncomfortable accepting such an extravagant gift from Brenden, Gabriela replied with careful politeness,"The dress is far too expensive. I honestly can't keep it."



After a brief pause, his reply landed-just as bold as ever. "It's already been worn. Who else am I going to give it to? Another girlfriend?"


Gabriela stared at her phone, nearly rolling her eyes at his gall.



Of course he had a collection of girlfriends, but did he have to make a spectacle of it every chance he got?What on earth was he trying to prove?



Gabriela took a steadying breath before offering,"How about I return the dress to the boutique and pay you back for it?"



She'd grown up learning to rely on herself-never taking handouts, always wary of the invisible strings money could attach to people. Favors made her uneasy; she preferred to keep things free of mess. Don't even think about it." His sharp, authoritative reply came.



Before she could type another word, his next message landed. "If you're so grateful, bring breakfast to the office tomorrow."



Her fingers shook with nerves as she typed, "You're coming to headquarters tomorrow?"



Not bothering to clarify, he responded, "If you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend, you'll need to do things my way. And don't forget-I'm still holding onto some of your things."



Irritation crawled beneath Gabriela's skin.



The infamous flirt had finally been shipped off, and now he was breezing back into headquarters-supposedly just for a breakfast?



But she had no choice. If she refused, she'd lose the fake boyfriend she'd schemed so hard to secure.



Worse, in her carelessness that night, she hadn't even realized she'd left something behind in hotel room 1205.



The stress left her restless all night, tossing and turning until two stark shadows appeared beneath her eyes by morning. Long before sunrise, Gabriela hauled herself up,packed two breakfast sets, and slipped into a quiet corner of the company plaza to wait.



She stood waiting, nerves prickling, clutching her bags as a steady stream of employees filed past.



Even Wesley had already swept into the building,his usual entourage in tow-yet Brenden still hadn't appeared.



Gabriela couldn't shake the feeling that Brenden had played her.


Choosing her words carefully, she messaged "NotASaunders," hoping for a smooth response. "Mr.Saunders, I've brought breakfast to the office."



Wesley, lingering by the elevator, felt his phone vibrate. Still in a surprisingly decent mood, he fired off a clipped response. "Take it to the CEO's office.For your boss."



Outside the building, Gabriela hunched on a cold stone bench, her legs tingling and numb. She gaped at the message,utterly baffled.



What exactly was Brenden plotting this time?



The previous night, he and Wesley had put her through a loyalty test she hadn't even seen coming.  She'd offended Wesley by accident, and now she couldn't shake the feeling he'd be gunning for her today.



Securing a permanent spot at the company felt more impossible by the minute.



All she wanted was to steer clear of Wesley's radar,yet here Brenden was, practically pushing her straight into the lion's den. Did he honestly want to see her squirm?



Gabriela couldn't hold back anymore-she fired off an angry string of words on her phone, barely thinking about the fallout if her involvement with Brenden slipped out



Before she could finish, a light rain swept in out of nowhere, the cool droplets dousing her fury.



In the end, all her bravado fizzled, and she sent only a single, meek reply. "Okay."



She hated how gutless she was-then reconsidered.For an underling like her, delivering Wesley's breakfast wasn't just a task, but an honor.



Why would she bother getting upset? Life was still good. No sense in wasting energy on outrage.



She tucked her phone away, trying to collect herself,when a pair of gleaming black leather shoes suddenly came to a stop in front of her.



Just then, the rain above her vanished.



Blinking in surprise, Gabriela glanced up-and found Wesley standing over her, a sleek black designer umbrella held out to shield her, his steady gaze locked on her face.
###Chapter 21 You Jerk



Gabriela couldn't help staring-Wesley looked almost unreal, standing there with the rain cascading off his umbrella. She scrambled to put on a bright smile and chirped, "Morning, Mr.Moss!"



Wait, hadn't he already gone inside? What was he doing back out here... and shielding her from the rain,no less?



Her mind spun, but she still managed a cheery wave,tilting her head, trying to look as sweet and endearing as possible.



Wesley's tone was even, but his gaze lingered on her "It's raining. Why are you crouched here?"



Realizing how awkward her posture looked, Gabriela straightened her back a little and answered truthfully,"My legs went numb."



For a moment, she thought she glimpsed a smile flicker in his eyes. Then, without warning, Wesley offered her his hand. "Come on. Get up."



Gabriela blinked slowly, disbelief flooding her eyes.



Was she really supposed to accept the CEO's hand  like that?



Wesley leaned in, his voice a notch softer."Are you going to keep spacing out?"


His hand hovered closer. Panicking, Gabriela tried to leap to her feet, only to discover her legs were still wobbly.She lurched forward, completely off balance.



Wesley caught her, his hand steadying her as a faint,teasing smile flickered at the corner of his lips."What's this? Throwing yourself at me again?"



Gabriela, still unsettled after last night's awkward showdown over overtime pay, found herself strangely composed in the face of this new embarrassment.



After all, if Wesley had already gotten the wrong idea about her,things couldn't possibly get any worse.From that moment on, she knew she wouldn't be afraid of what came next.



She drew in a quiet breath, lifted her chin, and offered him the breakfast with both hands. "Mr. Moss, I brought you breakfast."



She had no idea how Brenden managed to get Wesley involved in something as trivial as breakfast delivery,but if Brenden dared to ask, their relationship had to be closer than she'd realized.



Wesley accepted the meal with a polite nod. "Thank  you."



Without another word, he turned and strode back to his office.



Knowing winter mornings turned food icy in minutes,Gabriela had carefully sealed everything inside a sturdy thermal container.


When Wesley twisted off the lid, a comforting wave of steam drifted up, rich with the scent of freshly made breakfast.



Every detail showed how much care Gabriela had poured into the meal.


But as Wesley realized exactly who all this attention was for, an unwelcome irritation pricked at him.


From the sidelines, Billy nervously watched Wesley's ever-shifting expression, eyes glued to the little thermal container, uncertain how the scene would play out.



Without warning,Wesley plucked his phone from the desk and fired off a message to Gabriela. "This breakfast doesn't cut it."



At that moment, Gabriela had already made her way back to the sales department, powering up her computer to slog through another round of data entry.Aubrey,ever the gossip,hovered at her side, rehashing every juicy detail from last night's banquet.



Gabriela answered in distracted fragments, still simmering over being dragged into Brenden's games.When she caught sight of his text, her mood plummeted even further.



Of course a spoiled rich playboy who dined on five-star cuisine would turn his nose up at a plain breakfast.But why had she, of all people, become his chosen target for amusement?



Gabriela gritted her teeth but forced herself to swallow her frustration, her fingers hovering over the keyboard before she typed out a neutral reply. "What would you like to eat?"



Wesley, reading her mild response, only grew more irritable. His reply came back cold and fast. "I want another tomorrow, and you're cooking it yourself."



Gabriela's eyes widened in disbelief as her irritation hit a boiling point. But before she could react, another notification appeared. "I don't eat cilantro or onions.Nothing too sweet. No strong flavors, and absolutely no chili. Got it?"


That was it. Gabriela finally snapped, her fingers flying across the screen as she shot back, "You've got to be kidding,you jerk! You're so picky, but you still want me to cook? What if I just poison you instead?" Brenden knew exactly what she wanted-his silence about their night together and his cooperation in the boyfriend charade.



It gave him all the leverage he needed, and he relished every moment of keeping her on edge



Gabriela decided she'd had enough. If it meant losing her fake boyfriend and this internship, so be it.



With a top university on her résumé and a master's degree on the way, she had no reason to cower anymore.



Meanwhile, Wesley read Gabriela's rare burst of rebellion and, for the first time all morning, his mood brightened.



A hint of a smile touched his lips as he calmly opened the breakfast container and ate with effortless grace.



Billy stood by the door, anxiety fluttering in his chest as he waited for Wesley to sign off on the stack of documents. But when he caught a rare glimpse of Wesley in good spirits, a wave of relief washed over him.



At the same time, curiosity gnawed at Billy.



Wesley,usually so unreadable and reserved, seemed oddly light today-almost approachable.

 Trying to be subtle, Billy craned his neck,angling for a peek at the phone in Wesley's hand.



He couldn't see who was on the other end, but the flash of a venting message caught his eye and left him reeling.



His eyes widened, pupils narrowing in surprise.



Before Billy could puzzle it out, Wesley's voice broke through his thoughts. "Go make some coffee."



Billy straightened immediately. "Understood," he said,then slipped out to the break room.



No sooner had he started the coffee machine than Jerome Cruz, one of the secretaries, appeared in the doorway. He looked anxious not to miss a chance to butter up. Rushing over, he offered, "Let me handle the coffee.Please."



Jerome,always meticulously dressed,had clawed his way onto the CEO's secretarial staff and treated the role like it was the pinnacle of his career. He took immense pride in every detail, refusing to let Billy handle even the most trivial tasks-like making coffee -if he could do them himself.



Billy shot Jerome a strange look, and suddenly blurted out,"Jerk." Jerome's lips twitched in quiet frustration as he muttered, "Billy, did I do something wrong? Why did you start insulting me?"



With a lazy half-smile, Billy clapped Jerome on the shoulder. "Relax. I don't mean it."



Most people would've bristled at being called a jerk.But instead, Wesley-of all people-seemed oddly cheerful, as if the insult had brightened his day.


Did he actually like being ridiculed? Was there something weirdly gratifying about it for him?



Upon returning to the office, Billy stared at Wesley in disbelief,handing over the coffee.



Later that afternoon, Wesley presided over a high-stakes meeting that dragged on for well over an hour,with no resolution in sight.



Yet, for once, the air in the boardroom was lighter-Wesley's mood was unmistakably upbeat, his usual harsh critiques replaced with surprising patience.



After the meeting wrapped up, one of the executives sidled over to Billy, lowering his voice with practiced nonchalance. "Mr. Moss is in a surprisingly good mood today.Did the Athea project finally go through?"



Billy just shot him a mysterious smile. "Why don't you take a guess?"



The executive, curious, pressed on. "So it's not that?Is there some other good news? Enough with the theatrics-spit it out."



Billy only shook his head, lips curving in the faintest hint of amusement. "That's classified."



Well, the real reason behind Wesley's sudden cheer -the fact that he'd actually enjoyed being insulted-wasn't something Billy would ever share.



The executive walked away, defeated. His quest for office gossip thoroughly thwarted.



While Gabriela stewed over her earlier outburst, she braced herself for Brenden's sharp reply.



Instead, the reply arrived lazily around four o'clock."Make pasta and borscht for dinner."



She stared at the message in disbelief



Pasta? Borscht? Was this somekind of joke?



She responded bluntly, "I don't know how to cook."



The reply came almost instantly, as if the other person had been expecting her to protest. "Leave the office early and bring dinner to the company by seven. I'll give back what you left in Room 1205." Gabriela racked her brain, trying to remember what on earth she might've forgotten in Room 1205. Was Brenden just making it up to mess with her?



She fired off a curt reply, "No way!" then began stuffing her things into her bag, determined to make her exit.



Inside the CEO's office, Wesley stared at the text, lips quirking with genuine amusement. "She's got some temper," he mnurmured.



Just then, Billy walked in just as Wesley's lips curved in a rare, genuine smile at his phone.



For a second, he stood frozen in the doorway,wondering if his boss had just been insulted again.



Wesley's strange delight in insults cracked his normally aloof image.



The whole idea left Billy quietly rattled. 
###Chapter 22 His Birthday



Wesley had barely begun typing his reply to Gabriela when his phone rang with an incoming call from his grandmother,Loretta Larson.



"Wesley, it's your birthday today. Come have dinner at my place tonight," Loretta said, her voice warm and expectant.



After his mother's passing, Loretta had stepped in to raise him. Their bond ran deep.



"I'll be there," Wesley promised.



He ended the call, noticed it was nearly five o'clock,and told Billy to get the car ready.



Loretta's home sat tucked away in the quiet suburbs,a long drive from Wesley's company. By the time the car eased into her driveway, the sky had already turned a deep blue.



Stepping out, Wesley immediately spotted Brenden standing by the porch, hands shoved in his pockets.Wesley's eyes narrowed, the faintest crease in his brow betraying his annoyance.



Brenden, as oblivious as ever, waved him over with boyish enthusiasm. "Wesley! I knew you'd show up for dinner tonight. It's been a long time since | saw Loretta,and since it's your birthday, I thought I'd crash the party too."



Brenden's father was the younger brother of Wesley's father-making them cousins by blood. After his parents split, Brenden had ended up with his mother -who was rarely around.



Growing up, he'd attached himself to Wesley, trailing after his older cousin through childhood and spending more time under Loretta's watchful care than with his own mother. Maybe that was why he and Loretta connected so deeply.



Wesley merely acknowledged him with a brief nod.



Sticking close, Brenden fished a gift box from his bag -wrapped meticulously, ribbon and all. "Happy birthday,Wesley."



The date never failed to weigh on Wesley; his birthday landed on the same day his mother had died. No one in the family ever made a fuss about it.



Still, Brenden had always insisted on bringing a present each year.



Wesley accepted it, his voice level. "Thank you."



Billy quietly stepped in to take the box, handling it with care.



They moved forward together, the three of them passing into the living room.



Loretta was mid-conversation with a young woman,her animated gestures filling the room with a lively energy.



As footsteps echoed across the polished floor,Loretta glanced up and her whole face lit with joy. Rising from her seat, she reached out to take Wesley's hands in her own, her eyes shining with unmistakable grandmotherly affection. "Wesley, you've gotten so thin! Are you eating enough?"



A rare, gentle smile softened Wesley's features."Grandma," he greeted, his voice low but fond.



Brenden arrived a beat later, eager to get in his own greeting. Loretta pulled him in for a hug, treating him with the same radiant affection.



With a delighted little flourish, Loretta turned to the young woman at her side. "Wesley, do you remember this lovely girl? This is Fiona Dewitt. You two were in elementary school together-doesn't that bring back memories?"



Wesley's brow furrowed, an uneasy suspicion flickering in his eyes. So much for a simple family dinner. Was he being set up on a blind date?



Fiona stiffened for a heartbeat, caught off guard by the sight of Wesley in person.



She'd researched thoroughly before agreeing to meet him. She understood Wesley had a reputation as a rising titan in the business world.



What she hadn't anticipated was his sheer presence-he commanded the room effortlessly, and he looked even more striking than she remembered.



Quickly masking her surprise, Fiona folded her hands in her lap and waited, poised and silent, for Wesley to break the ice.



Brenden, whose weakness for pretty women was legendary,straightened with interest and shot Wesley a mischievous wink. With a teasing undertone, he murmured, "Guess today's your lucky day."



Wesley's eyes turned glacial. One warning glare from him had Brenden's bravado crumbling; the playful smirk vanished and he immediately fell silent.



At last, Wesley addressed Loretta, a trace of weary affection in his voice. "Grandma, what's going on here?"



Loretta explained, "Fiona's just come back from her studies abroad-she's earned her PhD! Beauty and brains all in one package. She heard it was your birthday, so she came all this way just to celebrate."



Fiona set a meticulously wrapped present on the table,her cheeks tinged pink. "Happy birthday, Wes."



Wesley replied with a nod,his expression frosted over with indifference,"Thank you."



Keeping his tone civil but drawing a clear boundary,he added, "Ms. Dewitt, just call me Wesley. I'm uncomfortable with you using that endearment for me."



His chilly reserve needed no further explanation.



Fiona blinked, completely taken aback.



She'd always been confident in her beauty, her doctorate, and the opportunities her lineage provided.Men usually bent over backward for her-how dare Wesley treat her like this?



Being brushed off so bluntly was completely new to her.



Her cheeks burned with embarrassment and anger.Biting her lip, she turned toward Loretta, glossy eyes swimming with unshed tears.



Loretta's smile faded, her tone turning mildly reproachful "Wesley, Fiona's our guest. You could stand to be a little friendlier."



Out of deference to his grandmother, Wesley swallowed his irritation and managed a stiff, remote apology. "Sorry."



Fiona's frustration only deepened.



How could he treat someone like her-elegant,successful, impossible to overlook-with such indifference?



Even so, Wesley's striking looks almost made up for his frosty manners; she could overlook a little arrogance in a man who looked like that.


She gathered herself, smoothing her expression into something poised and refined. "Don't worry about it.Feeling a little out of place after so long is only natural,Wesley."



Wesley let her words hang without a response.



Eager to lighten the mood, Brenden leaned in with an easy grin. "Hey, Fiona, remember me? Brenden Saunders-I was in your class too, back in elementary school.With Wesley."



Fiona managed a gracious smile, her voice perfectly cordial. "Nice to see you again, Mr. Saunders."



Outwardly she kept up her polished facade, but inside  she barely spared Brenden a thought, already dismissing him as unworthy of her attention.



Though he carried Moss family's blood, Brenden used his mother's last name, and the family's fortune never touched his life. None of the Moss business or assets were his to claim.



If not for her own need to maintain appearances in front of Loretta, Fiona wouldn't have spared Brenden a glance.



Brenden, hopelessly charmed by a pretty face and completely blind to Fiona's indifference, leaned in with a hopeful grin. "Want to add me on WhatsApp?Let me buy you dinner sometime."



Fiona unlocked her phone and exchanged contacts with him. Then she immediately turned toward Wesley,phone in hand, her tone casual but unmistakably pointed. "Wesley,I just realized-we're not connected on WhatsApp either."



With Loretta's gaze on him, Wesley had no choice but to comply. He accepted her request, expression unreadable.



Loretta, visibly delighted by the display of youthful harmony, clapped her hands together. "Go on and chat, the three of you. I'll get dinner ready-it won't take long."
Soon enough,Loretta returned, arms full of steaming dishes, and called everyone to the table.



She absolutely doted on Fiona, urging her to eat more and constantly adding food to her plate, her approval shining through every gesture.



Annoyance sparked behind Fiona's lashes, gone as quickly as it appeared.


That grimy fork had obliterated any trace of hunger,but she forced herself to smile through it, determined to appear gracious for Wesley's sake.



Wesley,arms folded,watched her performance unfold.



Once the meal ended, Loretta bustled over and tapped Wesley's shoulder. "Wesley, Brenden-sit with Fiona for a while. I'll whip up some drinks for everyone."



Brenden didn't want to be the third wheel, so he angled himself toward the opposite end of the couch,already half-distracted by his phone as he shot off a quick message to his girlfriend.



Fiona edged a little closer to Wesley,letting herself lean into the solid comfort of his presence. Her voice came out soft. "Wesley..."



"Sorry, I have to catch up on some work," he interrupted, not looking at her as he slid his phone  from his pocket. He offered a clipped, polite nod, then focused on his screen, thumbs moving deliberately as he scrolled through unread notifications.



At the top sat his last WhatsApp chat with Gabriela-a blunt refusal from her to make him pasta. The memory pulled at him.



He found himself wondering what Gabriela was doing now.



Actually, Gabriela was busy in the kitchen, sleeves rolled up and hair tied back.



She was a master at talking herself into surrender-and tonight proved no exception.



It didn't take long for her to realize that cooking was nothing next to the danger of getting fired from Apex Group.



Since Phyllis was out for the evening, Gabriela slipped into the kitchen and enlisted her cook's help. In no time,she had a pan of pasta simmering on the stove,the rich aroma curling through the air and making the whole kitchen feel inviting.



She moved on to the borscht, working with quick,practiced hands.



Watching from the edge, the cook, Ken Belmont,couldn't help but praise her. "Honestly, your cooking might even surpass mine."



Gabriela returned his smile, her eyes bright with mischief."Thanks."



Making borscht was child's play, but those arrogant texts on her WhatsApp kept replaying in her mind,souring her mood. Irritated, she started tossing ingredients into the pot with reckless abandon.



"Oh, you don't eat cilantro or onions. Nothing too sweet. No strong flavors, and no chili. Let's see how you handle this," she muttered under her breath,grabbing fistfuls of sugar and chili and flinging them in.



Ken could only stare, speechless.



He quietly rued his earlier praise as the soup transformed into an unappetizing mess.



With brisk efficiency, Gabriela ladled the potent soup into a thermal container, snapped the lid shut, and hailed a cab for the office.



She arrived before seven, only to find the main doors locked tight against the evening chill.



Shivering on the steps, she pulled out her phone and shot off a text to "NotASaunders."



"When will you arrive?"
###Chapter 23 Do You Have Any Idea What Today Is
The gentle buzz of his phone caught Wesley's attention. He glanced at the screen and replied,"Where are you?"



Gabriela's eyelid gave an involuntary twitch. Was Brenden messing with her again?



She swiftly responded, "I'm at the office. You told me to cook dinner for you, didn't you?"



Wesley's brows shot up. He fired off another message."Didn't you say you wouldn't do it?"


Gabriela had braced herself for this. Grinding her teeth,she answered, "It's just pasta and borscht. Making it doesn't take much effort."



A subtle smile flickered across Wesley's lips as he typed, "Wait there. I'll be over soon."



Gabriela stiffened at hiswords,her temper simmering


She couldn't help but remember that night after the team-building event,when he'd told her to wait-then left her hanging till midnight. This time, she wasn't willing to put up with it any longer. Fuming, she shot off a message. "What the hell is your problem, you jerk? I've put up with enough of your crap! If you're going to act arrogant, go ahead -pull whatever stunts you want. I'm tired of always going out of my way for you!"



Wesley broke into quiet laughter, picturing the fire blazing in her eyes as shetyped.



Across the room, Fiona had been lurking in silence,feeling invisible. The second she caught the amused glint in Wesley's eyes, jealousy burned through her.



Who on earth was flirting with Wesley?



Determined to get his attention, she plastered on a concerned smile. "Wesley, I'll see if Loretta needs anything," she murmured sweetly, pushing herself to her feet. She put on a show, purposely twisting her ankle as she staggered toward him.



Wesley, sensing her plan, stepped aside without a second thought.


Fiona's little performance backfired-she collided straight into the edge of the sofa, her chin throbbing where it struck the armrest.



Despite the ache, Fiona's sharp eyes caught a glimpse of Wesley's phone. The WhatsApp name "Liar" flashing on Wesley's screen didn't escape her notice.



But the real shock wasn't the name-it was the content. Whoever it was, the person wasn't sending Wesley flirtatious messages, but outright mocking him.



The person actually called him a jerk, right to his face.



To her astonishment, Wesley only smiled, looking almost pleased, as if he relished the insult.



Fiona was utterly bewildered.



Without giving Fiona's stunned expression a second glance, Wesley coolly directed Billy to bring the car around.



Afterward, he strode off to find Loretta, offering a polite farewell. "Grandma, something urgent just came up at the company. I have to head out."



Loretta's gaze darted toward Fiona, her eyes alight with quiet approval.



In her mind, Fiona checked every box-poised,elegant, and armed with a doctorate. She couldn't have asked for a better candidate for Wesley, not just in background but in temperament too.



What truly won Loretta over was that Fiona had just  returned from overseas and eagerly come to her place to celebrate Wesley's birthday, even rolling up her sleeves to help out in the kitchen. Fiona was genuinely sweet, untouched by even a trace of spoiling.



Convinced she'd found the perfect match for Wesley,Loretta had already started planning their future together. But Wesley, ever the workaholic, was clearly ready to escape.



Loretta had no intention of letting that happen.



Sensing her true motives, Wesley pivoted at once and instructed, "Billy, drive Ms. Dewitt home."



Billy didn't hesitate as he replied, "Right away, Mr.Moss."



Without missing a beat, Wesley added, "Once she's back, come straight to the office. That project can't wait."



Bitly, sharp as ever, played along and nodded. "Got it."


At those words, Loretta knew she'd lost the round. She understood the pressure Wesley faced running his own business, so she could only offer a gentle reminder."Come visit me more often."



Still, she was determined to keep Fiona in the picture.She silently resolved to invite Fiona over as much as possible, hoping the two of them would eventually warm up to each other.



Wesley answered with respectful warmth,"Of course,Grandma. I'll come by often."


Feigning concern, Fiona tried to stall. "Wesley, if |take Billy's car, what will you do for a ride? Maybe I should just call a cab..."


Wesley didn't even look at her. "I'll ride with Brenden."



She was left with no choice but to go along, though her annoyance simmered beneath the surface.



Brenden ended up driving Wesley back to the office.



As the car rolled through the city, curiosity finally got the better of him. "Wesley, are things really that demanding? Why are you heading back to work so late?"



Wesley leaned back, eyes shut, radiating total disinterest.He ignored Brenden's question entirely



Brenden pressed his lips together, remembering his own sudden transfer out of headquarters. With Wesley in this mood, he knew better than to push any further



Brenden barely let the silence settle before seizing on a new topic. "Hey, Wesley, Fiona seems into you.She's got a doctorate, she's gorgeous, and the Dewitt  Group's practically a major player on the global stage Honestly, she's a great match for you."



Wesley's eyes drifted open just enough to shoot Brenden a frosty glare. His tone was sharp and flat."She sounds perfect for you."



That single,glacial line made Brenden's skin prickle.



He'd dated his share of women, but his mother,Marissa Saunders, had never nagged him about marriage. None of his past girlfriends ever passed muster.



If Marissa even got wind he might be interested in Fiona, she'd have the whole city in an uproar.



The thought of his mother's theatrics clamped his mouth shut. Brenden decided he valued his peace more than gossip, so he kept quiet the rest of the drive.



When they finally pulled up to the office, Brenden did a double take-Gabriela was perched on the front steps, her arms wrapped around her knees, waiting in the chilly evening air.



He nudged Wesley with an elbow and remarked, "You drag Gabriela in for overtime too? She's sharp, I'll give her that, but she's still just an intern-hasn't even graduated. Try not to scare her off, yeah?"
 Wesley fixed him with a steely gaze. "So you're worried about her now?"



Brenden's shoulders tensed under his scrutiny. The instant Wesley's tone turned icy, Brenden's bravado vanished.



He waved his hands defensively. "No way! She's just an intern-honestly,she should feel lucky to learn from you."


Wesley's glare lingered, making Brenden wilt. He fumbled to open the car door, eager to put space between them.



Wesley stepped out and walked straight toward Gabriela.



Bundled up in a thick coat, Gabriela perched on the steps, absently counting the lines between bricks to pass the time.


Lifting her head, she startled at the sight of Wesley striding toward her.



Waiting for Brenden, she was caught off guard by Wesley's appearance.



Wesley came to a stop in front of her, his usual sternness giving way to a flicker of concern. "Are you cold?" he asked, voice gentler than she'd anticipated Gabriela struggled to come up with a reason for lingering outside the company so late, but Wesley's unexpected concern caught her by surprise. She muttered,"No."



A faint, rare smile tugged at Wesley's lips as he glanced at the two thermal containers she clutched."Those for me?"



It dawned on Gabriela with a jolt-the meal she'd prepared was meant for Wesley.


Realizing she'd been roped into Brenden's little scheme to score points with Wesley, she thought bitterly that calling him a jerk was far too kind.


Wesley reached out, waiting expectantly. "Hand them over. I haven't eaten dinner yet."


Gabriela hesitated, hands tightening around the containers. Just as she was about to surrender them,she jerked them back, heart pounding.



She'd dumped an ungodly amount of spices into the borscht purely to get back at Brenden. If Wesley actually ate it, there'd be hell to pay



Wesley arched a brow, his gaze sharp. "Aren't these for me?"



Gabriela, not daring to say no to her boss,hesitated  for a beat before surrendering the containers



Without another word, Wesley led her into a cozy café down the street.



The moment he stepped inside-immaculately dressed,every line of his suit crisp-heads turned. Waiters scrambled to greet him, tripping over each other in their eagerness.


"Sir, what can I get you to drink?" one asked, eyes only on Wesley.



Gabriela nearly flipped her eyes upward in disbelief.


Was she just background scenery? Did she really not exist to these people?


Frustrated, she sat down and slumped in her chair.



Wesley ordered two coffees, his tone so casual it was clear he was used to this treatment. When the waiter scurried away, he popped open the container of borscht.



The spicy, tangy aroma filled the air. A handful of chilis and cilantro sprigs drifted on the surface.


Wesley's lips twitched in amusement. He recognized a little payback when he saw it.


Gabriela kept her eyes fixed on Wesley, scrambling to  cover for herself. "Mr. Moss, actually, the soup was all Mr. Saunders's idea. I think he has some, uh, very particular preferences."


She felt zero remorse about tossing Brenden under the bus-after all, he'd set her up first.


Wesley just gave a bland, disinterested nod,making no move to call out her obvious lie.


Gabriela, spotting his calm acceptance, hurriedly flipped open the second container. "Mr. Moss, would you like to try this instead? I made a classic pasta-just a simple, straightforward recipe. But I promise it turned out delicious."



As she looked at him hopefully, the anticipation flickered in her bright eyes. Wesley, unexpectedly affected by her enthusiasm, felt his voice turn rougher than usuaL. "Do you have any idea what today is?"



Gabriela's mind went blank. Her gaze darted away as she desperately tried to recall if the date meant anything important.



After a few silent beats, she still came up empty,vaguely wondering if she'd missed some company milestone or forgotten an anniversary.
###Chapter 24 Does He Actually Enjoy Being...
Wesley's smile faded as he caught the puzzled look on Gabriela's face.



"Never mind. It's nothing important," he said, his tone losing some of its warmth.



A subtle heaviness seemed to settle over him.Gabriela sensed the shift in his mood but, not knowing him well, decided not to press further. "You should eat, Mr. Moss, before it gets cold," she urged,her voice gentle but cautious.


For a moment, Wesley looked lost in thought,but then something shifted behind his eyes. The earlier chill in his expression softened. He picked up his fork and started eating.



Gabriela,who'd been anxiously waiting for his reaction,found herself entranced by the elegance of his movements.



Here was the man she usually admired from a distance,now seated directly across from her, quietly enjoying her meal.



His subtle satisfaction was unmistakable. For once, Gabriela didn't feel like a mere employee grinding through overtime. The dynamic between them felt different-more intimate,somehow.


In that quiet moment, Wesley seemed less like her untouchable boss and more like a familiar friend.



Gabriela's enchantment lasted all of five heartbeats before common sense jolted her back to earth.



She knew better-Wesley might have c npped the arrogance tonight, but every inch of hin still broadcast untouchable wealth. Even the watch on his wrist was a level of luxury she'd never reach, not in three decades of honest work.



Watching a man like him-an undisputed tycoon-perched in a tiny café on a drafty night, savoring her homemade pasta, felt so absurdly out of place that it sparked a wave of reckless, foolish fantasies she tried to smother.



Desperate to regain her composure, Gabriela mentally chanted passages from the employee handbook, word for word, determined to keep her guard up the next time she faced Wesley.



Meanwhile, Fiona sat stiffly in the passenger seat of Billy's car, her mood soured.



The Moss family had three eligible heirs all circling the prize,and no one knew who would eventually land the throne.



Truth be told, if Wesley weren't the most captivating of the lot, Fiona never would've endured his indifference.



Still, every time she pictured his striking features, she found herself unable to let go.



Haunted by the memory of Wesley's perpetual indifference-how his rare warmth was saved for that mysterious person who dared insult him-Fior found herself prying for answers from Billy.


She sidled up beside Billy and asked, "Billy, is Wesley always drowning in work? Has he ever actually dated anyone?"



Billy managed a bland, practiced smile. "I'm afraid I wouldn't know, Miss Dewitt. As just an assistant, I'd never meddle in Mr. Moss' personal life."



Fiona refused to be shut down. She leaned in, her voice coaxing. "Then what about his tastes? Does Wesley have any favorites? Any hobbies?"



Billy remained impenetrable, his tone unwaveringly polite. "My interactions with Mr. Moss are always purely professional. I couldn't say."



Watching Billy avoid any mention of Wesley's personal affairs only stoked the fire of Fiona's  frustration.



She silently vowed that if she ever did become Mrs.Moss, her first act would be to fire Billy.


Whenever Fiona thought about Wesley's commanding elegance, she resisted backing down.


The urge to win him over gnawed at her, spurring her on.



Softening her voice, she probed, "Billy, I spent the whole night with Wesley and picked up on some thing odd. Does he... actually enjoy being insulted?"


Billy's grip on the wheel tightened for a split second.


Oh no! Could she have stumbled onto Wesley's biggest secret? How had things slipped so badly?


But he smoothed his features in record time,answering with a light chuckle, "Of course not, Miss Dewitt. You're imaging things."


Billy's denial didn't fool Fiona for a second-she caught the flicker of discomfort in his eyes and felt more convinced than ever.



Back when she'd been overseas, Fiona had breezed through a few psychology books, so she knew full well that some people harbored unusual preferences -there were even those who got a thrill from being  scorned or humiliated.



Such a revelation about Wesley comnpletely stunned her.



She simply couldn't picture the immaculate,dignified Wesley possessing any sort of strange desire, let alone something so peculiar.


Yet throughout the evening, Wesley hadn't said a single word to her. Instead, he sat absorbed in his phone, lips curled in a rare, gentle smile,even as the messages he read were downright rude.


Fiona's chest tightened with envy. She longed to be the one who could make Wesley smile like that.


Back at her apartment, Fiona replayed the memory of Wesley's soft smile until it slipped into longing.Unable to hold back, she pulled out her phone and typed,"Wesley, I made it home safe. Thanks for asking Billy to drive me."



She waited for his reply, but the screen stayed dark.After her shower, she tried again, her damp hair leaving a faint chill on her shoulders as she sent. "I'm heading to bed now. You should rest too, Wesley.Goodnight."



Wesley's phone buzzed twice on the coffee table beside him,each message lighting up the screen in the quiet room. Gabriela, seated nearby, happened to glance at the glowing notifications.


The brief glimpse told her enough-both messages from a girl. She quickly looked away, suppressing a smirk.



Ever since spending more time with Aubrey, Gabriela's own curiosity about office gossip had grown. She pictured some sweet, earnest girl out there nursing a crush on the famously cold Wesley, bravely texting him goodnight while he left her on read.


Wesley cut the moment short, pushing his chair bork."I'm done. Let's head out."



The way Gabriela's eyes lingered on his phone made his mood nosedive and appetite disappear.



He rose from the table with a cool finality. "I'll have someone drive you home."


Gabriela, startled by his sudden chill, scrambled to gather her things. "That's really not necessary.I can just grab a taxi-please, don't trouble yourself."


Yet Wesley wouldn't let it go. He quickly called for a car,walking Gabriela out to the curb himself.



When he caught the flicker of uncertainty on her face,he drawled, "What's wrong? You want to haggle with me for overtime?" Gabriela shook her head so fast her hair nearly brushed his shoulder. "No, of course not. I'm just glad I could cook for you today."


His lips pressed into a frown, and she instinctively swallowed any mention of overtime.


Rubbing the bridge of his nose, Wesley dropped the conversation. When the car pulled up, he opened the door and gestured for her to climb in.


Three uneventful days drifted by, and then the weekend rolled around.



Aubrey was practically glowing as she checked her reflection in the office window for the fifth time before clocking out.


When Gabriela asked what had her so excited, Aubrey beamed.Her boyfriend-who lived halfway across the country-was finally coming to town.



Aubrey grinned and nudged Gabriela's arm. "Hey, why don't you hang around tonight? My boyfriend and I can take you out for dinner."



Gabriela shook her head with a gentle laugh. "You two deserve your time together. I'd only be a third wheel."



Aubrey grinned, tossing her hair with satisfaction."That's my girl." Watching Aubrey glow with anticipation, a pang of envy flickered through Gabriela's chest.



She pulled out her phone, hoping for a distraction,but her WhatsApp list looked painfully empty. No one to message,no one waiting for her reply.



Her thumb hovered mid-scroll as she realized-these days, her most frequent contact was Brenden.



The memory of their one-night stand made he-heart flutter despite herself.


Unable to resist, she typed out a message.Saunders, are you free tomorrow?"



If he was available, maybe she could bring him home tomorrow-just to shut down Phyllis's nonstop jabs and pay Josh a quick visit.



Meanwhile, Wesley sat stiffly at Loretta's house,forced to sit through her never-ending chatter.



Today, she was relentless, circling back to the same topic-why he needed to get to know Fiona. His patience wore thinner with every word.



Just then,Gabriela's message popped up, souring his mood further. With a trace of irritation, he shot back,"What is this? Are you trying to reel me in? Are you aiming to be my thirty-ninth girlfriend?"
###Chapter 25 | Actually Like Someone
At that moment, Brenden was having dinner with his girlfriend at Golden Days when a sudden sneeze caught him off guard.



His girlfriend, already irritated, shot 'm a glare."Brenden, looks like some woman is thinking about you,huh?"



Brenden threw up his hands, exasperated.


He might be a serial dater, but he always ended things cleanly before moving on. Even if he had his eye on someone new, he made a point to break up first-he was careless, not a cheater.



Clearly,someone was out there talking trash about him.


Meanwhile,Gabriela stared in disbelief at the phrase "thirty-ninth girlfriend."


For a moment, she was speechless, floored by just how casually Brenden seemed to cycle through relationships.



Jaw clenched, she shot back. "Keep dreaming!" Wesley caught the message and a faint smirk flickered across his face.



The cloud over his mood finally eased, and he resisted the urge to tease her further.


Next to him, Loretta's praise for Fiona grew even more effusive, her disapproval barely masked as she noticed Wesley glued to his phone.



"Wesley, listen to me," Loretta announce J her tone brooking no argument. "I'm very fond of Tiona.Tomorrow's the weekend, so I've invited her for dinner. You'd better be on your best behavior-no hiding behind work excuses."



Loretta took great pride in Fiona's polished family background, impressive education, and gentle disposition. She made up her mind to push Wesley and Fiona together.



Wesley let out a weary sigh. "Grandma, my career is only just getting off the ground."



"You already have more money than you can spend in a lifetime!" Loretta shot back, her glare sharp. "You're thirty-one, Wesley. If you don't settle down soon,how am I supposed to live long enough to see my great-grandchildren?"



Knowing she was about to launch into another tirade, Wesley relented. "Grandma, I actually like someone.I'll bring her over to meet you someday."



Loretta's eyes narrowed with suspicion. "Who is she,then? What's her family background? Are you seriously telling me she's a better catch than Fiona?"



In Loretta's mind, nobody could possibly measure up to Fiona.



Wesley's relentless dedication to his ca eer made it impossible for her to believe he'd developed foelings for anyone overnight. She remained convinced he was simply dodging any talk of marriage.


With sincere composure, Wesley offered, "She's a decent person."



The only flaw he saw? She could provoke his anger effortlessly-while remaining completely oblivious to what sparked it.



Loretta was ready to press the subject further when Wesley's phone buzzed again. He glanced down at the screen,immediately reaching for it.


This time, it wasn't Gabriela's message that popped up,but Fiona's-a contact he found increasingly irritating



"Wesley,weekend kicks off tomorrow-are you free?"



Lately, Fiona's messages kept flooding in, making Wesley even more determined to tune her out



Elsewhere, Fiona sat in front of her phone, irritation simmering.



She'd fired off message after message, but Wesley hadn't bothered replying-not even with a perfunctory emoji.


Usually, with so many suitors clam oring for her attention, Fiona never had to chase anyone Wesley's aloofness, however,left her baffled.



She debated whether she had stooped to something as childish as hurling an insult just to get a reaction.



Thinking back to the faint, almost amused smile she'd seen flicker across Wesley's face last time, Fiona steeled herself and typed out a gamble. "Hey, jerk,want to go watch a movie with me tomorrow?"



Instead of ignoring her, Wesley actually responded-if a question mark even counted as a reply.



That tiny sign of life only fueled Fiona's determination.



She shot back another message. "Seriously, you jerk,is that all you can manage? Too busy to even answer me properly?"



Wesley glanced at his phone, then at Loretta,who was still waxing poetic about Fiona's many charms. A sly idea flickered through his mind.



He replied, "And you are...?"



Fiona's anger simmered dangerously



How could he act like she was a stranger? She was used to being admired and chased. Now, barely a week after they'd become friends on WhatsApp,he had forgotten about her?



No matter how many texts she fired off, ia stayed silent-until she threw an insult his way.


That alone made her suspicious. Was this legendary business genius actually into being scolded?


The possibility left he both irritated and oddly intrigued. Refusing to back down, Fiona typed with swift, determined fingers."It's me, Fiona. How dare you forget me, you jerk?"


He fired back, "Really? I don't think you are Fiona."


Without hesitation, Fiona hit record,her voice sharp and taunting. "You jerk, does my voice finally ring a bell?"



Wesley switched his phone to speaker, letting Loretta hear every word for herself.



Loretta sat frozen in disbelief, the elegant image she'd built of Fiona crumbling in an instant.



"But Fiona always seemed so poised and sweet. How could she possibly say such things to you?" she stammered, her voice thick with shock.



Without a word,Wesley handed her his phone, letting the barrage of Fiona's sharp-tongued messages speak for themselves.



Loretta slipped on her reading glasses, scrutinizing the screen as her expression shifted from co, fusion to utter dismay. She simply couldn't reconcile this with the girl she thought she knew.



Stunned by her discovery-and embarrassed by how enthusiastically she'd just praised Fiona-Loretta let out a weary sigh. "Did spending a few years overseas really turn her into a different person?"



Wesley didn't let the chance slip by. "Grandma, you can't just judge people based on how they look or what they say. You really have to take your time and see what they're actually like."



With a heavy sigh, Loretta admitted, "I got it wrong this time."



That realization finally convinced her to stop pressuring Wesley about marriage-at least for now.



A wave of relief swept over Wesley. Without  hesitation, he unfriended Fiona on WhatsApp right there in front of Loretta.



Meanwhile, Fiona was left staring at her phone,perplexed by the silence that greeted her latest voice message.



She remembered how gently Wesley had replied to that rude message and wondered if her rebuke hadn't been sharp or inventive enougl



After trawling the internet for clever ults, Fiona composed another cutting message and hit send-only to discover, moments later, that she'd been unfriended.



Her features shifted from confusion to disbelief,then settled into a frown.



What was happening here? Why did the other person receive a polite reply from Wesley after sending insults, while she ended up being unfriended for doing the same thing?



For someone used to being the center of attention,Fiona found it unbearable to be dismissed so abruptly and without explanation. The slight gnawed at her pride.



Her mind drifted to Brenden-the ever-smiling one who seemed to get along with everyone, Wesley included. Reluctant but determined to get answers, she sent a message to him. "Hey Brenden,are you free today? Want to grab a bite with me?"



Brenden had just picked up his phone to ask his new girlfriend out when Fiona's message landed, catching him off guard.



She'd been practically icy toward him at Loretta's house-so why was she suddenly asking him to dinner?



Though the invitation seemed suspici 'is, Brenden never minded making time for a pretty won n.He agreed without hesitation.



The next day, they met at Golden Days.



Fiona tamped down her revulsion, offered him a plastic smile, and tossed out a few half-hearted pleasantries, even going so far as to apologize for her aloofness back at Loretta's place.



Brenden found her sudden sweetness downright unsettling. He shifted in his seat and cut to the chase."So,why the dinner invitation out of the blue?"



Fiona lowered her gaze and spoke in a careful,tentative voice. "Brenden, you're close with Wesley,aren't you? Do you know what he's actually into?Back at Loretta's, he barely looked my way."



Brenden rubbed his jaw, lost in thought for a moment. Wesley's life revolved around work-he was cool,distant, almost impossible to approach. Loretta was the only one who ever coaxed out a trace of warmth from him.



After a pause, Brenden replied, "Wesley's just...reserved. He needs time to let anyone in. Stick around long enough, and you'll figure him out."


Fiona's face fell. "But he untric nded me on WhatsApp."



Unfazed, Brenden just shrugged. That's classic Wesley.His whole world is work-women don't even register on his radar."



She studied Brenden, voice wary."Does he have any odd habits or, like, unusual preferences?"



Brenden stared at her, completely thrown off by the question, because as far as he knew, Wesley had no unusual preferences.



He was just about to say so when Fiona, gnawing her lip,pressed on. "Is he the type who actually likes being scolded?"



That question nearly sent Brenden tumbling out of his chair. He shot her an incredulous look."Are you even hearing yourself right now?"



Fiona began her explanation. "I saw him texting

 someone the other day. The person kept calling him a jerk and insulting him, but instead of getting mad,Wesley was grinning the whole time. It honestly looked like he was into it."



Brenden was left speechless, floored by her revelation.



Beneath Wesley's polished exterior lurked a merciless workaholic, the kind of boss who could freeze an entire boardroom with a glance. No one in the company dared cross hin -not even the top executives.



Brenden never imagined anyone would have the nerve to talk back to Wesley, let alone scold him.



The idea made him curious, almost amused, about who could be that audacious.



But then he snapped back to the matter at hand."Hang on-what does this have to do with him dropping you from his contacts?"



Fiona wavered, her lips pressed together as she struggled to answer. "I sent Wesley a few messages,and he ignored every single one. So I figured...maybe if I scolded him the way that person did, he'd respond."



Brenden's jaw practically hit the floor. "Are you serious? That actually happened? I don't buy it!"

###Chapter 26 Is Wesley A Masochist
Fiona bristled at Brenden's skepticism. Since she still needed Brenden's help, she suppressed her irritation,fished out her phone, and scrolled straight to her chat history with Wesley.



Brenden's gaze landed on We_'ey's WhatsApp profile -a brooding night sky with a pale mc on veiled behind shifting clouds.



Then he went through their chat history, finally believing her story



He was surprised that Fiona, usually so soft-spoken,could be so audacious as to insult Wesley, leaving him utterly stunned.



Fiona let out a sigh. "I insulted him, and that's literally the only time he's ever responded to me," she confessed, her tone dropping. "Maybe my insults just weren't creative enough. That's probably why he ended up unfriending me."



Brenden shifted awkwardly and cleared his throat."There's nothing I can do about this," he admitted.glancing away He was just as intimidated by Wesley as anyone else and had zero intention of pleading her case.



Fiona pouted, coaxing him with a playful lilt. "Come on, just help me figure out what'll actually get Wesley's attention. Please?"



Brenden always had a soft spot for women who turned to him for help-and he had to admit,ho was genuinely curious if Wesley secretly enjoyed being scolded.



With a resigned shrug, he gave in. "Fine, I'll try to find out what works on him next time I get the chance."



The next Monday, Brenden marched straight to headquarters and tracked Billy down in the break room.



Billy was surprised by his sudden appearance."Mr.Saunders? What brings you back< to headquarters?"



He guessed Brenden was there for the year-end meeting-Wesley had called him in.



Before Billy could say more, Brenden dropped his voice to a near-whisper. "I slipped in under the radar.Need to ask you something."


Billy was about to point out that Brenden's flashy outfit was already turning heads-everyone had noticed him by now.
 
 But Brenden barreled on, oblivious. "Billy, just be honest with me. Is Wesley... a masochist?"


Billy froze, blindsided by the question.



Brenden's tone grew measured as he continued, "It's a psychological thing. Some people genuinely get a kick out of being scolded or put down. Wesley seems to perk up whenever someone calls him a jerk."



Billy's hand trembled as he remembered the flash of Wesley's phone screen-someone had really called Wesley a jerk.



His hand trembled, causing the coffee to slosh perilously close to the rim of his cup.



After all these years of careful disguise, had Wesley's mask finally cracked? Was the truth bleeding through at last?



A flicker of shock crossed Billy's face, but he quickly collected himself, slipping back into his usual composed manner. With a steady voice and a look of mild reproach, he said, "Mr. Saunders, I realize you're upset about being transferred from headquarters,but that's not an excuse to start spreading rumors about Mr. Moss."



Brenden gestured at Billy's trembling hand. "Careful,man-your coffee's about to go everywhere." Was it just anger from his accusation against Wesley that made Billy's hand shake, or was it something more?



Billy forced a steady breath, deflecting. "Didn't get much sleep last night. Coffee's the only thing keeping me upright."



Yet Brenden couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. He leaned in, draping an arm around Billy's shoulders."Come on, we're basically brothers at this point. So level with me."



Billy brushed off Brenden's arm with a casual shrug,completely unmoved by his persuasion.



He'd been at Wesley's side since the day Apex Group was founded,watching up close as Wesley clawed his way to the top, building an empire from scratch and turning it into a powerhouse in just seven years.



Despite Wesley's quirks, Billy's loyalty never faltered -his respect for Wesley was set in stone.



Brenden couldn't extract a single useful word from Billy-but that silence told him everything he needed to know.



For as long as he could remember, Wesley had seemed untouchable-a legend, the one person Brenden admired above all others. He just never imagined the man he idolized would harbor such an odd quirk.



Still, something about it made Wesley seem a little more human-maybe even approachable.



A sudden itch of curiosity had Brenden wanting to test Wesley himself



Outside the break room, Aubrey overheard their entire conversation and was completely taken aback.



She floated back to her spot in the Sales Department,collapsing onto her chair in a daze.



Gabriela caught sight of her dazed expression and raised an eyebrow. "You were just up in the CEO's office dropping off documents, right? What's brought on that frown? Did the big boss chew you out or something?"



Aubrey brushed off Gabriela's concern with a quick wave,signaling it was nothing serious.



Relieved, Gabriela turned her focus back to the mountain of paperwork on her desk.



Hours slipped by in silence until, suddenly, Aubrey could barely contain herself



She darted over, seizing Gabriela's wrist with a burst of nervous energy. "Gabriela!" she blurted out, her voice barely above a whisper. "I've got the tea. But you have to swear you'll never breathe a word."



Gabriela arched an eyebrow but didn't answer right away.



That look, that tone-she'd heard it from Aubrey before.



Whenever Aubrey hinted at secrecy, it never stayed hidden for long; it would surface company-wide in no time.



Reflecting on it, Gabriela mumbled, "Spill it. I'm not about to run my mouth."



Aubrey shot afurtive glance around the office, then leaned in so close her hair brushed Gabriela's shoulder."Your crush? Turns out he's a total masochist."



Gabriela's eyes widened in disbelief. "Wait, who are you talking about?"



Aubrey gave her a look, as if the answer were obvious."Who else? Mr. Moss."



Gabriela arched an eyebrow, suspicion edging her voice. "And where'd you hear that? Don't tell me you're buying into office rumors again."



Aubrey pressed on, her eyes wide with conviction."I'm telling you, I heard Mr. Saunders say it himself. It's true!"


Gabriela frowned, "When did he say that?"



Aubrey leaned closer, voice dropping conspiratorially "He was back at headquarters today. I walked past the break room on the twelfth floor-he was chatting with Billy. I heard every word."



Gabriela couldn't reconcile the Wesley she thought she knew with the man this revelation suggested. Her thoughts whirled, torn between disbelief and curiosity.



She hesitated only a moment, then darted to the balcony, clutching her phone. With trembling fingers,she shot off a message to "NotASaunders."



"Hi, Mr. Saunders, do you have a moment?"



Wesley's hand froze midair as the new message flashed across his phone. He barely had time to register the words before a second, more frantic question popped up. "Is it true that Mr. Moss is a masochist? Does he really like being scolded?"



A startled cough burst from his throat, coffee splattering across the pristine table. His face darkened at once.



All around the conference room, the department heads went stiff, eyes darting between each other and their normally unshakable CEO. Wesley, who prided himself on his composure, had just lost it-in front of everyone.



A ripple of nervous energy swept the room. Not a single person dared to speak. Speculation simmered beneath the silence,each executive silently wondering what could possibly rattle Wesley like this.


Unfazed,Billy reached for a tissue and handed it to his boss, his expression steady.


Wesley methodically wiped his hands and mouth,tamping down the irritation rising in his chest as he fired off a reply. "Who told you that?"



Gabriela refused to throw Aubrey under the bus, but given Aubrey's big mouth, she suspected the news had already made its rounds among a handful of colleagues.



She tapped out her response. "Everybodyat the office is talking. Someone claimed you said it yourself, but|don't buy it. That's why I wanted to ask you straight."



Wesley might have been known as a cutthroat businessman,but Gabriela still respected him-enough that it stung to hear his name dragged through the mud.



Even with Wesley's ironclad self-control, her reply still made his pulse hammer in his ears. He spun toward Billy, jaw clenched tight. "Find Brenden. Bring him to me. Now."

###Chapter 27 Getting A Beating
Billy darted out of the conference room, phone in hand,eager to call Brenden.



The word "masochist" still lingered in his mind-he'd glimpsed it on Wesley's screen and had a vague idea of what was happening.



When Brenden answered, Billy told him that Wesley had summoned him, then hesitated, tempted to hint that he was in trouble. But Brenden didn't give him a chance to elaborate; he sounded downright pleased that Wesley was asking for him



"Today's the company's annual meeting. Is Wesley summoning me to announce my transfer back to headquarters?" he murmured.



Brenden had been stationed at an Apex Group subsidiary-director in name, but the branch was barely scraping by. The so-called promotion felt hollow, especially with a dismal year-end bonus looming. A transfer back to headquarters would be the best thing for him right now.



Listening to Brenden's bright, clueless optimism, Billy couldn't bring himself to shatter it. He stifled the truth and replied, "Mr. Moss wants you at headquarters immediately."



"I'm actually close by," Brenden said, eager. "I'll head over now."



Once Billy returned to the conference room, Wesley resumed the meeting without missing a beat, his commanding presence effortlessly reasserted.



Billy found himself quietly impressed by Wesley's composure.



Just before the meeting wrapped up, Brenden arrived.



He lingered outside the meeting room,leaning against the door frame with his usual easygoing charm, a cheerful note in his voice. "Wesley, I..."



Before he could finish his words, every head in the meeting room swiveled in his direction.



Brenden's easy grin faltered, his expression tightening under Wesley's ice-cold stare. The tension was so thick it prickled his skin.



He scrambled to figure out what he'd missed-had he somehow offended Wesley without realizing it?Instinctively, he straightened and cleared his throat."Uh, did something happen? Who got on your bad side,Wesley?" Wesley flicked him a glance from the corner of his eye, then calmly snapped his folder shut. His tone was perfectly composed, almost disinterested.new project in Claei Swea needs your expertise-you're perfect for it. You'll head out this afternoon."



Relief flickered through Brenden's chest,though he remained wary. He forced a smile, hesitating as he asked,"Sorry-where exactly is Claei Swea?"



He was in unusually high spirits about the assignment,treating it as a company-sponsored getaway. Still, a nagging sense of unease tugged at the back of his mind, warning that this trip might not be as straightforward as he hoped.



Catching Brenden's puzzled expression, Billy stepped in to explain, "Claei Swea is an island nation out in the middle of the Ottercroft Ocean. It's a volcanic chain -gorgeous weather,breathtaking views.Honestly,it's the perfect place to escape the winter chill."



That seemed to settle Brenden's nerves. Puffing up with confidence, he nodded. "Thanks, Wesley! You can count on me-I'll see this project through."



Already planning to turn the trip into a mini-vacation with his new girlfriend, he pulled out his phone to do a little research.



The moment the word Afluena appeared on his screen, he froze, convinced his eyes were playing tricks on him.After triple-checking, the truth hit him like a sudden jolt of electricity.



"Why are you sending me to that desolate continent?"he blurted out, still trying to process what he'd just read.



Wesley didn't so much as blink. "You've been with the company long enough. It's about time you got some real experience."



His flat, detached voice offered no room for protest,as if Brenden's opinion didn't even register.



Brenden envisioned himself living in the harsh conditions of barren deserts and treacherous mountains.



That thought sent him spiraling. Ignoring the row of senior executives, he all but begged Wesley for mercy "| can't go to Afluena! The living conditions there are terrible, with unreliable resources and extreme weather. My girlfriend definitely won't be willing to go with me."



Billy couldn't help but find the whole scene ridiculous.



Rather than worrying about what might have triggered Wesley's anger, Brenden seemed far more distressed at the prospect of his girlfriend not accompanying him on the business trip After moaning for a solid minute, Brenden finally noticed that Wesley's face was as unmoved as a stone statue, and his heart plummeted.



Just as he was about to surrender to despair, he remembered those chat logs Fiona had once shown him.



If pitiful whining couldn't sway Wesley, maybe provoking his temper would work.



Desperation coursed through his nerves. Drawing a deep breath, Brenden hurled his last-ditch effort across the silent room.



He glared up, shoulders squared, and barked, "You jerk!You're unbelievable!"



Billy's jaw dropped, and a ripple of disbelief ran through the circle of senior executives.



The air went dead,thick with tension-every eye glued to Brenden as the shock registered in silence.



Was he really losing it right in front of everyone?Calling out Wesley like that in front of everyone?



If Wesley's frigid stare was any indication,the chances of anyone collecting a year-end bonus were evaporating fast. Wesley fixed his gaze on Brenden, a flash of warning glinting in his eyes.



Unfazed by the growing chill in the room, Brenden actually believed his little performance was having an effect. He squared his shoulders, doubling down with fresh bravado. "Wesley, let's be reasonable here. Just transfer me back to headquarters already-I'm not going to rot away in some backwater like Afluena!"



The senior executives exchanged nervous glances and quietly shielded their faces, pretending they hadn't witnessed any of this train wreck.



Billy,stunned and speechless, somehow managed to snap out of his daze to quietly signal the others to clear out of the conference room.



All the while, he ran the numbers in his head, weighing the fallout if anyone caught wind of their CEO's eccentricities. If rumors leaked that the man steering a publicly listed company harbored strange tendencies, the stock would plummet overnight-maybe even vaporizing hundreds of millions in market value.



Brenden's ignorance bordered on suspicious. Was he just dim-witted, or had a competitor planted him here as a saboteur?



Wesley's gaze turned glacial, his voice low and deliberate."What did you just say? Go on-say it again."



A frigid unease prickled down Brenden's spine, but instead of backing down, he doubled down and yelled,"I said you're a jerk!"



The words had barely left his mouth when a squad of uniformed bodyguards swept in and hauled Brenden out, ushering him firmly into the lounge next door.



Billy's nerves jangled as he scrolled frantically through his contacts, coming up empty-there was no one to bail him out.



Out of the blue, the memory of witnessing someone call Wesley a jerk on WhatsApp crossed his mind. If he could just track down that elusive figure, maybe they could help calm Wesley down.



But he had no idea who that person was, leaving him feeling helpless, reduced to silently rooting for Brenden's survival.



A handful of nosy executives, certain they wouldn't get caught, hovered just outside the door, straining to catch every word



Brenden, born with a silver spoon and handed the general manager's job through Wesley's connections,had never been more than a meddlesome, bossy nuisance in their eyes. Now he'd crossed the line by mouthing off to Wesley in front of everyone. They could hardly contain their anticipation, itching to witness exactly how Wesley would make him pay.



The muffled sounds of chaos from the lounge-a scuffle and Brenden's strangled yelps-caught the executives' attention.



"Wesley, what the hell? We're family-why bring out a squad of bodyguards on me?" Brenden wailed, voice rising in panic.



A solid thump echoed, followed by a sharp cry



"I'm sorry! If you want someone to curse you, I'll do it in private next time-ouch, that hurts! Wesley,get him off me. My arm's about to snap!"



As the executives exchanged glances, silently agreeing Brenden's luck had truly run out, Wesley strode from the lounge, serene and unhurried,straightening the cuffs of his dress shirt with the poise of a man untouched by chaos.



A moment later,Brenden emerged, limping badly, his face battered and swollen beyond recognition-his self-proclaimed handsomeness reduced to a tragic punchline.



He then shot Billy a look brimming with resentment. Had Billy warned him about the brewing storm,he wouldn't have walked in blindly and upset Wesley.


Billy simply looked away, saying nothing.



Meanwhile, in the sales department office Gabriela sat at her desk, growing increasingly anxious as the hours ticked by with no response from "NotASaunders."



She could already sense the rumors ballooning,every minute of silence giving them more room to spiral out of control.



Aubrey slid into the seat beside her, her complexion noticeably ashen. "Word is, Mr. Saunders got called into conference room by Mr. MMoss and walked out with a battered face."



She suspected that the sudden beating Brenden received was connected to the gossip about Wesley being a masochist.



She remembered spilling the story to another friend in the company besides Gabriela and wondered if her friend would also face a beating.



Regret flooded Aubrey's face; she looked on the verge of tears. Swallowing hard, she vowed never to gossip about others, especially when it involved Wesley. Noticing Aubrey's distress, Gabriela leaned in and murmured, "Don't panic. I'll go find out what actually happened."



This was the perfect opportunity to ask Brenden for the real story.



"Thank you, Gabriela." Aubrey's eyes followed her with a desperate, pleading hope.



Gabriela made her way up to the twelfth floor, nerves simmering as she lingered outside the conference room.



But she didn't catch a glimnpse of Brenden.Instead,she ran into Wesley, who had just stepped out of the room.



She straightened and offered a quick, polite greeting."Hello, Mr. Moss."



Wesley's brow creased in obvious irritation."Are you here for Brenden?"
###Chapter 28 A Promotion



Gabriela froze for a heartbeat,blindsided by Wesley's insight.



How could he possibly have guessed what was on her mind? Had he already learned about her one-night stand with Brenden?



The thought alone made her pulse quicken. Forcing her lips into a polite curve, she replied evenly, "I'm not here to see Mr. Saunders."



"Oh? Is that so?" Wesley's gaze drilled into her-dark,unreadable,laced with a faint edge of impatience. "As far as I know, you're still just a sales department intern.So why exactly are you on the twelfth floor?"


Her mind scrambled for an answer. The easiest escape would be to butter him up and hope it worked.



But with Wesley, whose moods shifted like quicksilver,one wrong word could backfire spectacularly.



She'd tried flattering him before-sometimes it had bought him a smile, other times only a cold look.Never had it earned her anything of substance-not even a token bit of overtime pay, let alone a permanent spot at the company. Perhaps, she'd been playing the wrong game all along.


Wesley wasn't the type to bask in compliments. If anything,he seemed to enjoy being scolded.



She thought she'd finally cracked a piece of his puzzle -yet one look at that impossibly handsome face,and every biting remark she might have mustered dissolved on her tongue.



Watching her cycle between wary hesitation and dawning comprehension, Wesley could practically read her thoughts.



The mere idea of Brenden staining his reputation had his fists itching to drag him back for another beating.



With a flick of his wrist, he dismissed her, his tone edged with cool detachment. "Get back to work."



Grateful for the reprieve, Gabriela wasted no time slipping out, hurrying back to the sales department.Aubrey barely glanced up before calling across the room,"Gabriela, there's a company notice!"



She hurried to her desk and opened the company email.



The bold text leapt out at her. "Brenden Saunders has been found responsible for spreading rumors about our CEO. As disciplinary action, he will be reassigned

 to the Clawei Sea well-digging project effective immediately."



Gabriela stared at the screen, momentarily frozen



Claei Swea was all the way out in Afluena-if Brenden was shipped there now, would he even make it back before the New Year?



She'd already gone through enough trouble just to secure this fake boyfriend arrangement, and now Brenden had gotten himself into a mess.



Honestly, with that level of brainpower, his romantic resume of thirty-eight girlfriends defied all logic.


While she stewed, Aubrey's voice chirped right in her ear "They're calling it a project assignment,but really,it's punishment. He'll be digging wells. Turns out Mr.Saunders' little rumor about Mr. Moss being a masochist was totally bogus. I knew it was nonsense."



Gabriela almost laughed at Aubrey's shamelessness.



This from the very same person who'd been practically buzzing with excitement to share that juicy bit of gossip earlier-and then let it slip to half the office



Aubrey wasn't finished. "Oh, and I heard he made a massive scene at the meeting. Stood right up and called Mr. Moss a jerk in front of everyone. No wonder they're shipping him off to Afluena."



Gabriela's stomach sank. With this mess blowing up,there was no way he'd be back before the New Year.



And without him, where on earth was she supposed to find another man to drag along to Phyllis's wedding?



She fired off a quick message to "NotASaunders.""Why are you being sent to dig wells? How long is this project going to take?"



Wesley stormed back into his office,his mood already black. Seeing Gabriela's text only soured it further. He shot back a blunt reply. "I don't know!"



A jolt of panic racing down her spine. "Is this because you spread that rumor about Mr. Moss being a masochist?" she typed furiously. "Why can't you keep your mouth shut? Even if it's true, you should've kept it to yourself. And now what? Are you planning on spending the rest of your life in Afluena digging wells?"



Wesley's jaw flexed as he read her message, every word steeped in her frustration.



Her reply made his grip on the phone tighten until it nearly cracked.



He shut his eyes, forcing the irritation down before he typed,"The rumors are false. Completely fabricated.Don't believe a word of it."Gabriela was caught off guard when she read those words.



Something in his tone didn't match the usual cocky bravado. Could it be that Brenden had finally learned his lesson and decided to act like he had a shred of sense?



Her shoulders eased as she tapped out another reply."You'd better watch yourself from now on. Don't go running your mouth about the boss. I'm warning you -he's petty enough to blow up over nothing.I used to butter him up every day, but he just ignored me and refused to pay for my overtime. He's a ruthless businessman who likes to exploit his employees. What possessed you to spread nonsense about him? You've dug your own grave. Listen, give it a few days for him to cool off, then go apologize properly. You might earn his forgiveness and be transferred to headquarters soon."



Gabriela's thoughts were plain as day-if Brenden would just heed her advice and offer a heartfelt apology to Wesley, Brenden could come home.



That way, she wouldn't be scrambling for another fake boyfriend.



Wesley,however, had no idea what schemes were running through her head. All he saw in her messages was an almost palpable concern for Brenden spilling out of the screen.



His expression darkened as he texted back, "Ruthless businessman? Exploit his employees? So that's how you see Wesley?"



The shift in his tone made her uneasy. Brenden sounded genuinely angry.



Was it because, as Wesley's relative,he could openly insult him while she wasn't even allowed to speak ill of him behind his back?



Before she could piece it together, a new message from "NotASaunders" popped up. "I took screenshots of your messages and sent them to Wesley."



For a moment, she simply stared, brain stalling. Then the shock ignited into fury so fierce her fingers itched to dig into her phone like it was Brenden's face.



That fucking bastard! She'd gone out of her way to comfort him, and he'd turned around and sold her out to Wesley without a second thought.



She was doomed.



Spotting the blood draining from Gabriela's face, she leaned in,brows knitting. "Gabriela, what's wrong? Are you alright?"



Gabriela nodded. She'd managed to offend both Wesley and a two-faced snake like Brenden. There was no salvaging this;she could only wait for the axe to fall and start clearing her desk.



Still, she forced herself to breathe, to think. Her postgraduate certificate would be issued soon. With that and her internship on her résumé,she could land somewhere else.



Being fired during an internship would be an ugly stain,though. Maybe she was better off quitting before they had the chance to show her the door.


Gabriela, weighed down by sadness and unable to concentrate, sat quietly at her desk scrolling through job listings.



Her focus broke when the sharp click of heels echoed across the sales department.



Tessa Ortiz swept in-Wesley's personal secretary,the woman who ran the executive office's assistant team with military precision, second in authority only to Billy and trusted enough to be at Wesley's side in nearly every meeting.



Her appearance here could only mean something important was about to unfold.



The manager of sales department hurried out, a broad smile plastered on his face. "Ms. Ortiz, what a surprise What brings you down here today?"



Tessa drew a crisp sheet of paper from her folder and passed it to the manager. "Year-end is chaotic, and the executive office is running short. We'll need to transfer someone from this team."



A hush fell over the room, as everyone was caught off guard by such a revelation.



Apex Group-one of the fastest-rising giants in the industry-hired only the best. Even entry-level clerks needed résumés stamped by elite universities.



The executive office was another world entirely, its staff boasting an average of postgraduate degrees;Tessa herself held two master's.



Landing a spot there wasn't just a promotion-it was a golden ticket.



The manager scanned the notice with deliberate care,his eyes narrowing slightly as he reached the last line,where Wesley's bold, unmistakable signature commanded the page.



A flicker of surprise crossed the manager's face before he masked it witha cordial smile and strode toward Gabriela. "Gabriela, Mr. Moss has personally acknowledged your abilities. You've been appointed as a secretary in the executive office.Congratulations." Gabriela stiffened, her brain scrambling to catch up.



She had just crossed Wesley, and now she was being sent to work under his nose. That hardly sounded like a promotion.



Wesley clearly wanted to get back at her-what a petty man.



Aubrey seized her arm, practically bouncing. "Gabriela,do you realize what this means? You'll be right there,working beside your dream guy every single day!"



But the thrill in Aubrey's voice only deepened the knot in Gabriela's stomach. She kept her lips pressed together, too uneasy to answer.

###Chapter 29 Confrontation



Aubrey eyed Gabriela's stiff expression and tilted her head,asking,"You look stunned, Gau riela. Are you so overjoyed you can't even speak?"



Gabriela mustered a thin smile as she replied, "Yeah,I'm absolutely thrilled."



Tessa appeared beside them with a warm grin."Please complete all handover tasks by end of day today. You can join us officially in the CEO's office tomorrow."



Despite her frustration, Gabriela could only nod and reply, "All right. Thank you, Ms. Ortiz."


"Drop the formalities-just call me Tessa," Tessa noted cheerfully before heading off to her next task



Gabriela had no real interest in moving into the executive office, but Aubrey was already hyping it up,pushing her to treat the team to dinner.



Before long, other coworkers gathered around to offer their congratulations, some with genuine smiles,others with thinly veiled envy



It was hard to believe that Gabriela, just an intern,somehow landed a spot in the executive office She sat there utterly unfazed, not a flicker of excitement betraying what was supposed to be the chance of a lifetime.



"When she started with us, I had a feeling Gabriela wasn't as innocent as she looked."



"Seriously! Barely here two months, and she's already transferring to the executive office.Who knows what she did to get there?"



"You remember that team-building retreat?Somebody caught her sneaking back in the middle of the night. I wonder whose bed she crawled out of."


"She really knows how to play innocent, doesn't she?Look at her-acting like the promotion means nothing."



Gabriela had never expected to stumble into such malicious whispers just by stepping into the bathroom



She got this transfer because she'd managed to offend Wesley. What did that have to do with who she spent the night with?



Gabriela repeated in her head, "Take a breath. Their crap isn't worth getting worked up about. Don't let them crawl under your skin."



She tried to steady herself, forcing slow breaths,but the vicious chatter outside wouldn't let up for a second.



"Being pretty is like hitting the jackpot. All she has to do is spread her legs and she's set for life-straight to the top."



"I bet Gabriela's had something done. There's no way anyone's born looking like that."


"Even if you got a new face, you'd still need her... let's call them 'bedroom talents.'"



Each biting remark scraped at her nerves, shattering any hope of staying calm. At last, Gabriela shoved the stall door open with a deafening crash.



When she was younger, Gabriela had to endure Phyllis's petty theatrics. She was powerless to push back for fear of upsetting her uncle and aunt.



But things had changed. She'd clawed her way into Apex Group without a soul's help. Now she earned her spot in the executive office, even if it meant ruffling feathers along the way. She wasn't about to let anyone tarnish her reputation.


The instant she stepped out, the group plunged into an uneasy quiet.


Minutes earlier, the three colleagues had been beaming and congratulating Gabriela. Now, they were caught mid-gossip, their faces flushing with embarrassment.



Gabriela strode past them with an air of cool detachment,unhurried as she turned on the faucet and began washing her hands.



Silence hung awkwardly in the room.


Even the trickle of water sounded thunderous, each drop amplifying the tension. No one dared move or speak.


Once she finished, Gabriela dried her hands and turned to face Cali Turner, pinning the prettiest-and by far the loudest, nastiest-gossip of the bunch with a cool,deliberate stare.



With a slow, deliberate motion, Gabriela reached out and tapped Cali lightly on the cheek. "Want to know whose bed I climbed into? The CEO's. Mr. Moss himself."



With Wesley already loathing her, she might as well watch them choke on his name



Cali's two friends stood frozen frozen, eyes wide in disbelief.



Most people would deny a rumor like that, or at least get flustered. But Gabriela just brazenly owned it-she'd admitted to sleeping with Wesley. No one in their right mind would joke about something that dangerous. That made it feel undeniably real


Cali felt a cold jolt from Gabriela's damp palm on her cheek, but she didn't have the nerve to shove her away.


Fury and jealousy churned within her, her gaze dripping with malice.


"What makes you think you're so special?"she hissed,her voice trembling. "Mr. Moss would never be interested in someone like you."



Gabriela arched an eyebrow, her mouth twisting into a mocking smile. "Is that so? You honestly believe he'd pick you over me? Wake up, Cali. Mr. Moss noticed me for a reason. Face it-even if you poured a fortune into your face, you still wouldn't look like this."



Cali, stung by the taunt, spat back, "So what if you did sleep with Mr. Moss? You're just another toy to be tossed aside. WNomen like you exist just for his pleasure-nothing more."



Gabriela shot her a sideways glance, lips curling into a smirk. "That still puts me ahead of you. At least I have a place-what do you have? Nothing but envy."



Having endured this kind of confrontation repeatedly she met it with unshakable calm. Years of surviving mean girls and worse had toughened her skin to armor; Cali's words barely registered as an itch.


"I could hand you my place, but you'd still end up at the bottom. That's just how it is," Gabriela added,shrugging as if the outcome was inevitable.



Cali's pride shattered beneath Gabriela's heel. She'd never been so publicly put down. "You bitch. Not everyone's as shameless as you..."



Gabriela cut in, her voice razor-sharp, "Funny how it's always the losers who make the most noise. If you're scared for people to hear you, then shut your mouth If you're so brave, say it out loud and let the entire office hear you."



She swept an icy glare over the other two, her tone dropping to a dangerous hush. "Let me make this clear-keep running your damn mouths, and you'll regret ever mentioning my name."



The whole thing was laughable. Wesley was already about to toss her out; she refused to let anyone else walk all over her on the way If she was going down,she'd drag a few pests with her-because that was just how she played the game.


With that, Gabriela let go of Cali and strode away,her lips curled in a mocking smile Cali stood frozen, her complexion drained of color The other two looked equally rattled.



Just moments ago, Gabriela's vibe had shifted-she wasn't the soft-spoken girl they thought they knew Her presence now was sharp,commanding,impossible to ignore. None of them dared meet her gaze.



And why would they? She'd slept with Wesley, but kept it discreet, never flaunting a thing.


Anyone wise enough never dared challenge someone like her.



After putting the office gossips in their place, Gabriela slipped back into her cubicle, her earlier spark fading fast.



Brenden was family to Wesley, and even he had been exiled to Afluena on a dead-end assignment for crossing Wesley's line. What chance did she have-just an intern, totally dispensable-surviving in the executive office?



She'd entered Apex Group with visions of dominating boardrooms and calling shots, but all that ambition had drained out of her. Now she just felt hollow running on autopilot as she wrapped up her final tasks and stayed late to finish her handover



That evening, she joined Aubrey in the cafeteria,  swiping her card to treat her friend to dinner-a small gesture for what might be her last meal at the company.



Aubrey watched her, genuinely 'impressed. "You're really something, Gabriela. So calmi When you're working up there with Mr. Moss, you've got to look out for us."



Gabriela managed a cool smile, her tone flat. "There's nothing to celebrate. The executive office doesn't offer the same freedom as the sales department.Don't envy me just yet."



Aubrey shook her head as she countered, "We're just interns-they don't really send us out for business, so it feels more laid-back for now. But look at the regular employees. They're always running around,still handling clients long after we've clocked out."She lowered her voice, adding, "And apparently,working weekends is the norm. The sales department's cutthroat-if you're new, good luck standing out." A sly grin tugged at her lips. "Honestly,Gabriela, you should be glad you got transferred to the executive office."



Gabriela met her gaze, unfazed. "Hard work, heavy pay-no exceptions. Sales dangles big commissions,but over in the executive office, you only get a fixed paycheck." One of their coworkers had quietly bought a new house last month, paying for it in cash after closing a couple of major deals.

###Chapter 30 A Generous Salary
Aubrey didn't press the issue; she simply let out a wistful breath, her gaze drifting away.



"Once the New Year rolls around, you'll have your master's in hand. No wonder you landed a spot in the executive office. Makes me wish I'd pushed myself harder and gone for grad school too."



She'd spent years gathering solid experience at a smaller firm, but joining Apex Group meant starting over as an intern-her bachelor's degree just didn't carry enough weight here.



Gabriela shrugged lightly, her tone casual. "Honestly,I'd rather stick with sales. At least in this department,I don't have to worry every day about getting laid off."



Given her impressive academic background, Gabriela could have gone straight for an internship in the executive office. Instead, she opted for the sales department,drawn by the allure of commission-based pay that promised bigger rewards than a flat salary ever could.



As the conversation continued, a burst of laughter rang out nearby-Tessa's signature, unfiltered cackle
Tessa found Gabriela's childish thinking quietly amusing.



A stint in the executive office mneant rubbing elbows with Wesley himself-an intimidating prospect, sure,but the networking alone was priceless. Even if Gabriela eventually returnec to the sales department the contacts and skills she'd co ct would serve her for years to come



Hearing Tessa's laughter, Gabriela and Aubrey turned their heads. Aubrey called out, "Ms. Ortiz, fancy running into you here! Working overtime, are we?"



The workday had already wrapped.



Tessa let out a weary sigh. "I've been absolutely swamped. Looks like I'll be clocking extra hours again tonight."



At year's end, the executive office and finance department always ran at full throttle.



Tessa slid into a seat beside Gabriela and Aubrey for dinner, and once they'd finished eating, Tessa reached over and gave Gabriela's shoulder an encouraging squeeze. "Starting tomorrow, you'll be working with me. I'm really counting on you to help carry some of the load. Let's give it our all, yeah?" Gabriela's tension, and she answered with genuíne resolve, "I won't let you down."



Gabriela's plan was simple: tough it out through the chaos until year-end, pocket her bonus, and then make her quiet exit.



After a solid night's sleep, she a 'oke with her spirits soaring.



Gabriela never let grief drag her down for long: she knew how to shake off the weight and reclaim her strength.



She carefully applied a touch of makeup, fastened herself into a sharp women's business suit, and stepped into a pair of sleek heels. Instantly, she cut a commanding figure the moment she arrived at the office.



Inside the elevator, she ran into the three women who'd badmouthed her in the restroom the day before



As the doors slid shut, two of them offered wary greetings, their voices tinged with unease.



Gabriela, acting as though she'd completely forgotten their previous friction, flashed them a bright, easy smile. "Morning," she said, her tone friendly but confident.



Cali,looking visibly uncomfortable, mumbled a stilted greeting in return. "Morning."


The memory of Gabriela's icy fingers brushing her cheek lingered-so vivid it had chased her through restless dreams. She had no intention of provoking Gabriela ever again.



The elevator hummed upward-first swpping at the fourth floor for the sales department and then carrying Gabriela all the way up to the executive office on the twelfth.


As the elevator doors slid shut in front of them, Cali and the others lingered in the corridor, watching the elevator continue upward-leaving them behind on their usual floor. The gulf between Gabriela and them,once barely noticeable, now felt unbridgeable.



None of them could deny it: Gabriela's rise had been swift and undeniable.



On the twelfth floor, Gabriela halted in front of the executive office, drawing a slow breath as she squared her shoulders



She forced a quiet, defiant smile. Whatever happened inside, she could always walk away if Wesley made things unbearable



She refused to let anyone break her spirit



With her resolve steady, she rapped on the polished door. It swung open to reveal a bright-eyed young man whose easy grin radiated friendliness. "You must be our new teammate, right? Welcome aboard! I'm Jerome Cruz."



Jerome was a genuinely nice guy-the kind of easygoing that put everyone at ease.



Gabriela offered him a courteous smile before greeting the rest of the team, her tone warm but reserved.Without lingering, she made her way straight to Tessa's office.



"Good morning, Ms. Ortiz. Is there anything you'd like me to tackle first?" she asked, her voice steady.


"One moment," Tessa replied, fingers flying across the keyboard.She barely glanced up as she printed out a file and handed it over. "Per the new memo, you'll be handling Mr. Moss's meals from now on. Billy will introduce you to him in a bit."



Gabriela took the document, feeling the full weight of her new assignment settle on her shoulders.


She had braced herself for this moment. Wesley hadn't brought her to the executive office for a promotion-he wanted to watch her squirm.


Determined not to bend to his will, Gabriela vowed she wouldn't let Wesley walk all over her, no matter what she'd once felt for him. She was here to fight back, not roll over.


Tessa slid a crisp transfer form across the desk, her tone brisk. "The executive office comes with a heavier workload and unpredictable hours. Be ready to stay late on short notice. Make sure you review the new schedule carefully."


Fingers grazing the paper, Gabriela registered the unrelenting timetable that dwarfed her old sales routine.



But as her gaze landed on the salary section, her breath caught.



The number nearly made her dizzy-twenty-eight thousand.



Gabriela blinked, double-checking the three zeros trailing that figure as if they might vanish if she looked away.



Her salary had more than tripled overnight, blowing past anything she'd made in sales, where commission always dangled on uncertainty.



A surge of adrenaline swept through her at the thought of her swelling bank account, and a quiet determination set in.



With this much on the line, she could stomach any

 us Salary hardship.



Let Wesley scheme and make things difficult; with this kind of paycheck, she felt unshakab'e, ready to take whatever he threw at her.



Billy soon summoned Gabriela into his office, his gaze flicking over her with unreadable intent.



Brenden had been shipped off to Afluena for some remote well-digging assignment, while Gabriela had just landed in the executive office, tasked with overseeing Wesley's meals and daily routines.


The timing felt suspicious-too coincidental not to set off alarm bells. Maybe they'd both been shuffled around for the very same reason.



An awkward silence stretched between them until Gabriela broke it, her voice steady. "Mr. Clarke, is there anything you need me to handle right now?"



Everything here was unfamiliar, every procedure a blank slate. She'd have to build her footing from scratch.



Billy snapped to attention, shifting into work mode."When Mr. Moss arrives, make sure you have a latte ready for him. No sugar. No ice. Understood?"



"Sure thing." Gabriela answered, steadying her nerves as she took mental notes. 
Billy's tone turned brisk. "There's a quick meeting at ten thirty-don't let Mr. Moss's coffee go cold.If you see the steam fading, swap it out for a fresh cup.no matter what's happening. And order his lunch ahead of time; the meeting may drag on past noon. He'll only eat from The Gilded Fork. Ask Jerome for their number." He didn't miss a beat as he rattled off more instructions. "No spicy dishes, nothing overly sweet,and absolutely no onions or cilantro. He's picky-stick to his preferences."



Billy delivered Wesley's food preferences flawlessly.



A tidal wave of instructions threatened to drown Gabriela, but the promise of a fat paycheck kept her afloat.Determined to prove herself, she nodded so vigorously it nearly became comical.


"After lunch, Mr. Moss will be heading out. Pack a charger,chaging cable, an umbrella, and a towel. For specifics, check in with Jerome. Oh, and don't forget -have a couple of brand-new outfits ready, just in case," Billy instructed, ticking off each item as if reading from a script. He finished with a brisk, "Clear on everything?"



"Crystal clear," Gabriela answered, flashing a confident smile. She prided herself on her sharp memory, but a flicker of doubt crept in. "Wait, it's my very first day, and you want me to accompany Mr. Moss already..." Her voice dropped, uncertain.



Was that really all right?



Billy seemed to agree, but wit: Wesley's orders in place and no permission to accompary them, he had no choice but to step back.



Gabriela,still uncertain about Wesley's true intentions,pulled out her notebook and diligently scribbled down every one of Billy's instructions, her face earnest and focused.



Her attentiveness drew a look of quiet approval from Billy.


Moments later, Wesley strode in, fresh from the elevator-impeccably dressed in a custom black suit.


His commanding presence and sharp profile stole the breath from the room, leaving Gabriela momentarily starstruck.



She quickly replayed Billy's instructions in her mind and hustled to brew a fresh cup of coffee for Wesley.



Returning to the office, she found Wesley immersed in paperwork, his sharp gaze intent and his slender fingers dancing over crisp sheets. The image made her pulse skip, but she forced herself not to linger.She set the steaming mug beside him with practiced care,her tone respectful. "Your coffee,Mr.Moss."Wesley didn't glance up, still scanning documents.
"You saw the new salary. Happy with it?"


She nodded without hesitation. "More than happy."


That generous salary hooked her, driving her to fulfill every one of Wesley's demands.


With a low, knowing laugh, Wesley asked, "Tell me-do I still strike you as the ruthless CEO type?"

###Chapter 31 Details About Wesley


Gabriela stiffened-the memory of Brenden forwarding her complaint about Wesley flashing through her mind. With quiet remorse, she admitted, "I misjudged you before, Mr. Moss. That was my mistake-l hope you'll overlook it this once."

Wesley finally pushed aside the stack of documents and spun his chair toface her, a low, amused chuckle escaping his lips. "No need for apologies. I'm a ruthless businessman, after all."

The self-deprecating jab caught Gabriela off guard.

Without warning, Wesley flung a heavy stack of paperwork onto her desk. "Memorize it. I'll be quizzing you tomorrow."

She grabbed the papers before they slid off the desk, alarmed by the sheer thickness-almost as thick as her own hand. There was no way she could memorize it all in one night.

On top of that, Wesley's schedule was jam-packed with back-to-back meetings and offsite appointments,and she was expected to shadow him the entire day. There wouldn't be a single spare minute to study.

Almost as if he'd read her thoughts, Wesley's tone turned brisk. "You want to know the essence of a ruthless businessman? I get every ounce of value from my people. If you can't find time during work, put in the extra hours at night."

Wesley's attitude toward her was nothing short of personal, and indignation prickled beneath Gabriela's calm exterior.

Still, the hefty paycheck made her bite back every retort. Besides, she'd brought this on herself.

Lesson learned,she thought bitterly. Wesley's name would never again dance on the tongue of her gossip.

Keeping her tone bright and unruffled, Gabriela replied, "Of course not, Mr. Moss. You're nothing like that.I know this is just part of the job." Wesley flashed a rare, satisfied smile. "Smart girl. You catch on fast."

With her pride stung but her bank account in mind, Gabriela powered through the chaotic day, determined to prove herself.

Luckily,Wesley kept his distance, preoccupied with his endless meetings and too busy to nitpick.

Later that afternoon, Gabriela trailed after Wesley as he strode out of the building, only to discover he'd lined up a golf match with Mason-the CEO of Alphacom Electronics.

Mason glanced over, his curiosity clearly piqued by Gabriela's presence at Wesley's side.

By the time the match wrapped up, the sun was already low in the sky. Wesley's work, however, showed no signs of slowing;he dove back into his paperwork and didn't come up for air until nearly eight.

One by one, the rest of the staff trickled out, until only Wesley remained, hunched over a mountain of documents.

Spotting her chance as Tessa and Billy had slipped away, Gabriela quietly gathered her things, hoping to make a discreet exit.

She edged up to his desk and cleared her throat. "Um, Mr. Moss.."

Wesley's voice stayed businesslike, eyes fixed on the desk. "How much of the material I gave you today did you manage to memorize?"

The question caught Gabriela completely off guard.

Was that question even reåsonable? Had he seriously forgotten she'd been glued to his side since noon,barely able to catch her breath, let alone cram a pile of notes?

She'd already planned it: trudge home first, chase the promise of a hot shower to wash off the day-then pull an all-nighter to memorize those notes.

Wesley's loaded question made it clear he fully expected her to stay late and grind through overtime with him.Wasn't that pushing things a little too far?But when Gabriela glanced at his unreadable face and then remembered the promise of a generous salary,she plastered on her borightest smile.

If she could survive grad school entrance exams, she could survive memorizing a stack of company files.

With a deep breath, Gabriela gathered the files, her mind already shifting into study mode.

As she read each word on the paper, she blinked in surprise.

Why was every detail on this sheet about Wesley, right down to his birthday?

December 27th? That was only a few days ago, right?

Her mind flashed back to the plate of pasa she'd fixed for him earlier that week. So that had been his birthday. No wonder he'd looked so frustrated when she hadn't realized what the day was.

But honestly, how was she supposed to know the boss's birthday on her first week as an intern?

Wesley just took offense at the slightest thing.

Gabriela pressed on with her memorization, scanning down the list.

Celery, sprouts, cilantro, garlic-every item made his"dislike" list.

Anything remotely spicy or pungent was out too: onions, chili, pepper, cumin-none of it could touch his plate.

The more she read, the more it felt familiar. She blurted out, "Mr. Moss, your food preferences are almost exactly like Mr. Saunders'."

Both of them were picky eaters.

No sooner had she spoken than she covered her mouth, silently begging for a chance to take it back.

To an outsider, she and Brenden would've barely known each other-how could she possibly know his list of forbidden foods? Letting that slip in front of Wesley was practically an admission.

Still, she couldn't entirely blame herself. It was only her first day in the executive office, and the nonstop whirlwind had left her frazzled. She'd barely survived the workday before getting saddled with another stack of files to memorize, and in her exhaustion,she hadn't watched her tongue.

As expected, Wesley's expression turned frosty without missing a beat. He leveled a piercing stare at her."It seems like you know a lot about Brenden. Maybe I should transfer you so you can be by his side?"

Gabriela clamped her lips shut, refusing to let another careless word slip.

She genuinely didn't want Brenden shipped off to Afluena, but she had even less interest in following him there. If she hadn't needed him toplay the part of her boyfriend, she'd have gladly erased him from her life.

Wesley's scowl deepened at the mention of Brenden, irritation radiating off him in waves. "We're done here for today," he snapped, abruptly ending the conversation.

Gabriela swiftly gathered her things, tucking the stack of documents Wesley had assigned her into a tote bag-making a show of it, just to prove her diligence right under his nose.

That subtle act actually seemed to soften the edge of his mood.

Wesley fell into step beside her as they headed for the elevator. He hit the button for the basement without a word.

Nerves prickled at the back of Gabriela's neck. "Mr. Moss, is it all right if I head out from the lobby instead?"she ventured cautiously.

Night had already fallen, and she worried the bus might leave without her if she was delayed any longer.

Wesley shot her a cool glance as he queried, "You really think I'd let a young woman head home by herself at this hour?"

Gabriela couldn't help but think that, with Wesley's prickly temperament, he was hardly the type to personally see off his employees-yet here he was.

When they reached the parking lot, she slipped wordlessly into the passenger seat, needing no prompting this time. To mask her discomfort, Gabriela buried herself in the thick stack of documents, pretending to study every page with laser focus.

The file read like an exhaustive dossier on Wesley-from the colors he liked to wear, down to the exact type of tie and even detailed steps for making his preferred coffee.

She mused that if she ever decided to leak this to the paparazzi, she could probably demand at least five figures for it.

Catching her not-so-subtle glance, Wesley kept his eyes on the road as he remarked, "You planning to memorize the materials by staring at me?"

Gabriela jerked her gaze back to the papers, cheeks flushing as she pretended to read.

Honestly, he was outrageous-demanding she commit a massive amount of personal information to memory without letting her catch his eye.

Determined to focus, Gabriela buried herself in the document-until her eyes snagged on a section listing Wesley's physical attributes.

Standing six foot two, he had long legs, a trim waist, wide shoulders, and a perfectly sculpted V-shaped torso.

He really did have the kind of build agencies dreamed of for runway shows.

Unable to help herself, she sneaked a quick sideways look.

His tie had come slightly undone; two buttons on his shirt were open, exposing the slight movement of his Adam's apple.

Just beneath, the line of his collarbone caught the soft overhead light.

Rumor was he jogged at dawn, which explained the smooth, defined muscle beneath his tailored clothes-every inch of him fit and athletic.

Wesley was the complete package: sharp mind, arresting looks, a body that seemed carved for envy. Gabriela was lost in thought until Wesley's low voice shattered the hush. "Eyes on the road."

She jolted upright, heart thudding as reality snapped back into focus.

A confused moment ticked by before she remembered-she wasn't the one at the wheel. Did he catch on that her mind had been spinning wild fantasies about him?

It wasn't her fault, to be fair. With Wesley's commanding presence filling the car, how could she not let her thoughts stray sometimes?

She ducked behind the stack of documents, cheeks flushed, refusing to risk another glance his way.

So she failed to notice the faint, knowing curve of a smile tugging at Wesley's lips.

The drive from the office to Rosemont Gardens blurred past in a quiet half hour.

When the car finally rolled to a stop, Gabriela gathered her things and offered a polite, "Thank you for the ride home, Mr. Moss."

For the boss himself to chauffeur a secretary-it was almost absurdly gentlemanly.

Wesley's eyes flicked to the folders in her hands. "Go over those tonight. I'll be testing you myself tomorrow."

Gabriela's fleeting gratitude vanished before it could take root.

In the shadows cast by the car's dim interior, she forced a brittle smile, jaw set with determination. "Don't worry, Mr. Moss. If it takes all night to get these down, then I won't sleep until I have."

Wesley's lips curved with approval. "That's what I like to hear."

She slipped out of the car and started toward the gates-only to find Phyllis waiting for her on the sidewalk.

Phyllis's stubborn devotion was nothing short of legendary; not a single day passed without her loitering outside the mansion's iron gates.

Tonight she'd outdone herself. Dustin stood at her side, and, to Gabriela's astonishment, even Josh and Marie had turned up for the late-night vigil. Without sparing a glance for Phyllis, Dustin, or Marie, Gabriela strode toward Josh, offering him a warm,easy smile. "Uncle Josh, what are you doing out here at this hour?"

Josh's brow creased as he carefully searched for the right words to address a delicate topic. "You're back awfully late tonight. Are you..."

Before Gabriela could answer, Marie cut in, her voice sharp with accusation, "Look at her, acting all high and mighty since she started at that big company. Doesn't even remember to greet her own family anymore."

Gabriela turned and nodded, her tone flat. "Aunt Marie."

Phyllis stepped forward, unable to hide her nosiness. "So, who gave you a ride home, Gabriela? Was it your new boyfriend behind the wheel?"

Gabriela met her gaze without flinching. "He's not my boyfriend. He's my boss."

Phyllis scoffed, arms folded, eyes narrowed, "Oh please. If you're going to lie, at least put some effort into it.What kind of boss bothers giving a lowly intern a ride home?"
###Chapter 32 The Moss Family's Heir


Though Phyllis clearly hated to admit it, even she couldn't deny that Gabriela worked for an influential powerhouse.

Her boss, Wesley, was a rising star in the corporate world-his name splashed across financial reports, his face on the glossy covers of top-tier magazines.

On top of that, he belonged to the formidable Moss family, a name that commanded deference every time it appeared in the media.

For someone like Gabriela, who seemed rooted in an unremarkable life, to be connected to a man of such stature felt almost absurd.

Gabriela, however, had no patience for Phyllis's relentless bullshit.

"Believe it or don't-it's the truth," she retorted sharply, stepping toward the door.

Phyllis sidestepped into her path, her expression tightening as she launched into her usual theatrics.

She put on a mask of concern and turned to Josh, her voice dripping with false sincerity."Dad,I might as well tell you the truth. Gabriela had feelings for Dustin too. But Dustin's heart belongs to me, and he chose me in the end. Since Dustin didn't return her feelings, she went after a wealthy businessman instead.Nothing wrong with him,really-except he's quite a bit older."

Gabriela marveled at Phyllis's flawless talent for distorting reality and drew in a breath to fire back.

Josh,however, looked devastated, the weight of her words hitting him hard. His face tightened in anguish."Gabriela, you graduated from one of the top universities. I poured my savings into your education, even supported you through graduate school, and this... this is how you repay me? You've brought me nothing but shame."

His voice cracked, and soon he was sobbing openly, tears coursing down his weathered cheeks. Gabriela clenched her jaw, forcing herself to keep her cool as the guilt trip rolled over her.

Marie fidgeted awkwardly, too mortified to say anything, yet clearly eager to see how Gabriela would respond.

Phyllis pressed on with her melodrama. "Gabriela, if you're really struggling, just come to us. My mom would never let you go hungry or let you wear shabby clothes. There's no need to cling to that old businessman,okay?"

Dustin's lip curled in open disdain as he piled on, his tone sharp. "I've told you before, Gabriela-no matter what stunt you pull, I'm never coming back to you. You've only managed to disappoint me further. End things with that man now, before you drag the family's name through the dirt."

Gabriela's patience snapped. She let out a cold laugh, her gaze cutting into him. "You survive on a woman's dime,Dustin.Just because Phyllis is young and pretty, you call it love? But if my boyfriend's older and not exactly a heartthrob, suddenly I'm a shameless gold digge? Are you kidding me? That's ridiculous. When it comes to double standards, you're in a league of your own."

Her words hit Dustin right where it hurt, and all the color drained from his face. Rage flickered in his eyes,as if he might snap at any second.

Josh stopped wailing mid-sob, left blinking in confusion by Gabriela's unexpected retort.

Phyllis scrambled to keep the peace, quickly soothing Josh before spinning on Gabriela, her voice sharp with accusation. "If you've got nothing to hide, and your so-called boss really drove you home,then why not have him step out and say hello?"

Fixing her with an icy glare, Gabriela shot back, "Meeting my boss isn't something that happens just because you want it."

Phyllis let out an exaggerated sigh. "You're getting slandered left and right, but your boss can't be bothered to come out and set the record straight?"

In that moment, the window of the sleek black Porsche glided down, revealing the refined, chiseled profile of a man whose very presence seemed to command the night.His gaze-cool, clear, and steeped in quiet authority-swept across the scene, making everything else fade into irrelevance.

A stunned hush fell over the onlookers.

Wasn't that Wesley-the Moss family's heir, the same man who'd been making headlines in every major financial publication?

Wesley didn't spare the others a single glance. Instead, he looked straight at Gabriela, his lips curving into a composed,effortless smile.getting late, Gabriela. Head home and get some rest. We've got work in the morning."

That brief smile carried an authority that seemed to charge the air around him. His effortless confidence left Dustin shrinking away, unable to meet his eyes.

Gabriela hadn't expected Wesley to step in, and a rush of gratitude welled up in her chest. She answered with a genuine, grateful smile, "Got it. Good night, Mr. Moss."

No matter how stingy he could be, deep down, Wesley realy was a decent guy. In that moment, Gabriela silently promised herself she'd work twice as hard to repay his kindness.

Before Wesley could leave, Marie hustled forward, her tone overly sweet with flattery. "Mr. Moss, it's such an honor. Gabriela can be so thoughtless sometimes-she shouldn't have bothered you for a ride home."

Marie, who usually wielded her words like a blade, now bowed her head in deference, her fawning so transparent it bordered on embarrassing.

Wesley answered with an easy composure, "Gabriela stayed late at the office, so I offered her a ride. Tell me,what made you think I was some old businessman?"

Marie's smile faltered as she scrambled to appease him. "Oh, Mr. Moss, you mustn't take it seriously. It's just Phyllis talking nonsense. Everýone knows how accomplished you are-starting your own company at such a young age!"

Watching Wesley step in on Gabriela's behalf made Phyllis burn with envy. The sight was intolerable. She couldn't stop herself from blurting, "I wasn't talking about you, Mr. Moss. But Gabriela really is seeing an older man and hiding it from us. I'm just afraid she'll make a foolish choice-ending up with someone twice her age just for money..."

"Shut up!" Marie cut her off sharply, her palm cracking across Phyllis' cheek. "Get over there and apologize to Mr. Moss this instant!"

Phyllis froze, one hand pressed to her stinging face, eyes wide in disbelief.

Ever since her family had seized Gabriela's mother's house, she had been coddled like a prized jewel-her parents never raising their voices, let alone their hands.

Yet today, because of Gabriela, she'd been struck in front of everyone. Humiliation burned in her chest.

Dustin lingered awkwardly nearby, while Wesley-effortlessly striking even behind the wheel-remained seated in his car, a figure of cool detachment. Phyllis bit her lip, but refused to bow her head.

To Wesley, she was nothing more than an annoyance. Without sparing her a glance, his deep voice cut through the air. "It's late. You guys should go home. Don't interfere with Gabriela's rest. She has important matters to handle tomorrow."

The message was unmistakable-Gabriela wasn't just an employee; she was entrusted with work that mattered. And anyone thinking of crossing her would be wise to think twice.

Marie's eyes darted nervously as Wesley's veiled threat echoed in her mind. She rushed out apologies,nodding along with every demand.

Wesley whipped the car around and vanished into the shadows, leaving silence in his wake.

Marie composed herself, then faced Gabriela with a brittle smile that didn't reach her eyes. "So, Gabriela,since when did you get so close with Mr. Moss?"

Gabriela shot a quick look at Josh, who was sniffling and wiping at his cheeks, then answered with a cool shrug, "I'm his secretary now."

The news seemed to brighten Marie instantly. Her smile stretched wide as she clasped Gabriela's hands inboth of hers, her tone turning syrupy. "You really have come a long way. I suppose all those years f invested in you finally paid off. Phyllis was careless earlier and managed to offend Mr. Moss. If you get a chance,bring him by sometime, would you? We ought to make things right and apologize in person."

Under Marie's leadership, the Haynes Group had made progress and managed to turn a profit, yet true prestige remained just out of reach.

She'd cooked up a calculated scheme: invite Wesley over, put on a show of intimacy, and use that illusion to unlock valuable opportunities.

Gabriela saw right through the ploy but kept her composure, masking her disdain with a faircourteous smile. "Your intentions are as hard to miss as a billboard lit in neon."

Marie's expression stiffened, a retort poised on her lips, but she swallowed it, wary of Gabriela's current standing.

Phyllis, unable to stomach Gabriela's sudden rise, couldn't hold her tongue."What's there to gloat about?You're just a secretary-still clinging to some old man. Honestly, Mom, Dad, this time she just lucked out.But her dirty little secret will explode into the open one day!"

###Chapter 33 Hypocrisy


Gabriela's lips curled in silent disdain.

Honestly, it was exhausting-Phyllis couldn't stop herself from taking cheap shots, clinging to her childish sense of superiority. Gabriela couldn't even be bothered to fire back.

Josh,finally shaking off his daze, frowned at Phyllis's biting words. "Gabriela might just be living her life,you know. There's no reason to assume the worst every time."

Phyllis bristled at Josh's unexpected support. Her voice turned shrill. "Dad, did you forget how she used to work those bars in high school-selling drinks, flirting with random men, doing whatever she had to for money? Those places were crawling with shady guys. It was disgusting. And Gabriela actually bragged about it!"

A flush of anger crept over Gabriela's face, her jaw tightening.

Since freshman year, Marie had quietly pocketed Gabriela's tuition money, secretly hoping she would drop out without a fuss. When Gabriela finally brought this to Josh's attention, he chose to believe Marie's story and blamed Gabriela for wasting the money.

Left with no other choice, Gabriela started picking up weekend jobs, scraping together every dollar shécould just to stay in school.

That bitter episode became the perfect ammunition for Phyllis, fueling the rumors she spread.

Now, after hearing Phyllis's slander again, Josh felt his faith begin to waver.

Year after year, Marie would hand over the supposed tuition, and yet, Gabriela always seemed to be hustling for cash, insisting she had to pay her own way. To him, it looked like she was just making excuses-spending time with the wrong crowd and earning a bad reputation.

A heavy sense of guilt settled over Josh-he'd failed to discipline Gabriela, betraying his late sister's trust Marie summoned up a wounded expression. "Everyone says being a stepmom is tough, but let me tell you,being the aunt isn't a walk in the park either. I've always treated you fairly, Gabriela-anything Phyllis had,you had too. Yet you still insisted on chasing odd jobs, dragging my name through the mud with the neighbors."

Josh rushed to Marie's side, his tone stern as he turned to Gabriela. "Gabriela, you need to cut ties with that old rich guy. Do what Marie says and stop making things harder for her."

Dustin,caught off guard by Gabriela's past, felt his earlier bruised ego soften just a little.

His grip on Phyllis tightened as he murmured, "Phyllis, Gabriela clearly has no self-respect. Stop wasting your time worrying about her."

Phyllis tucked herself against him and replied obediently, "Alright."

She refused to believe the old man could keep hiding forever. With her wedding just around the corner, she was eager to meet Gabriela's so-called boyfriend.

Secretly,she intended to round up Gabriela's old classmates from both university and high school,hoping to drag her name through the mud in front of everyone.

Surveying their expressions, Gabriela felt a wave of bitter amusement.

Not a single one of them actually cared about her. What was the point in bickering with them?

Choosing to sidestep the drama entirely, Gabriela slipped away upstairs and retreated to her bedroom.

After a long, steaming shower, she glanced at the stack of documents left on her nightstand-Wesley had said there was something important to tackle tomorrow. Most likely, it meant burning the midnight oil memorizing every detail.

Wesley had a touch of narcissism about him, but she had to admit he'd helped her out tonight. Maybe he wasn't all bad after all.

Gabriela scooped up thestack of documents and began poring over them, letting those notes burn into her memory. That night, after hours hunched over documents about his personal details, she drifted into uneasy sleep-only to find Wesley starring in her vivid, undeniably heated dreams.

The following morning at the office, just catching sight of him sent a rush of heat to her cheeks.Her heart hammered wildly as she poured his coffee, unable to meet his eyes without reliving fragments of that dream.

Wesley noticed immediately, his gaze sharp with concern. "You look a little flushed. Are you feeling alright?"

Gabriela rushed to cover, shaking her head with a forced smile. "It's nothing-just stayed up too late cramming for those documents, that's all. I'm running on fumes."

Wesley arched a brow. "If that's the case, let's hear it. Recite what you memorized."

Caught off guard, Gabriela faltered; she hadn't fully absorbed the documents and planned to revisit them later-now her own lie had her cornered.

She gave a clumsy, fragmented summary, hoping it would pass.

Wesley's expression remained unsatisfied, his tone cool. "You're my secretary, Gabriela. If you can't even remember my preferences, it makes me question if you're really up to the job."

A wave of frustration swept over her. The documents were endless-pages of facts about Wesley's medical history and meticulous dietary restrictions, even specifying the exact number of sips of water he was supposed to take each day. There hadn't been enough time to master it all last night.

This was starting to feel less like secretarial work and more like some bizarre spouse audition.

Of course, Gabriela just swallowed those thoughts, schooling her tone into professional politeness. "Time was really tight yesterday, Mr. Moss. If you give me half a day more, I'll have everything committed to memory."

Wesley caught the flush still coloring her cheeks and chose not to push her. Instead, he asked mildly,"You've spent so much time memorizing-has anything stuck yet?"

Gabriela blinked,caught off guard."Excuse me?" For the first time, Wesley's ever-stoic eyes seemed to flicker with something she couldn't quite place,which only made her more flustered. "M-Mr. Moss..."

He cut her off, letting his face shutter into its usual icy calm. "Forget it." A beat of silence, then he dismissed her coldly. "You may go."

Gabriela couldn't make sense of Wesley's sudden chill. Returning to her desk, she hurriedly pulled out the stack of documents he'd assigned her, scanning them for anything she might have missed.

What on earth was she supposed to memorize for him?

While Gabriela buried herself in memorizing, her so-called boyfriend Brenden was stuck on the outskirts of Afluena,sweating through a grueling well-digging project.

Every strike of the shovel was met with stubborn, unyielding earth. Frustrated, he dropped to the ground with a sigh, dirt smudging his jeans and hopelessness settling in his gut.

The team leader stood off to the side, arms folded, watching with a look of wry amusement. "At this rate,Mr. Saunders, you'll still be digging when next year rolls around."

Billy's orders were unmistakable: no one was allowed to lend Brenden a hand. The most the team leader could do was shout the occasional pointer from a safe distance.

Brenden dragged the back of his hand across his brow, smearing a streak of mud. "I'm not a well-digger.Wesley just tossed me a shovel and told me to get to work. What does he expect me to do,dig to the center of the earth, or does he plan to keep me stranded in Claei Swea for life?"

"My sympathies," the feam leader murmured, careful not to challenge Wesley, just giving Brenden a gentle pat. "Hang in there. If you dig hard enough, maybe you'll earn your ticket home in a decade or so."

The remark did nothing to lift Brenden's spirits.

Right then, his phone buzzed. Fionå's name flashed on the screen.

Oblivious to his posting in Claei Swea, Fiona's voice trembled as she asked, "Brenden, did you find anyhing yet?" Staring out at the bleak, endless expanse, Brenden felt a pang of quiet despair.

To his surprise, Claei Swea offered gentle breezes, but the woman he'd recently dated refused to tag along.

Brenden's voice carried a defeated edge. "Just let it go, Fiona. Wesley's impossible to read. You'll never get a handle on that man."

Fiona sounded genuinely lost. "What are you talking about? Can't we meet in person and figure this out?"

"Not a chance," Brenden sighed, heavy with resignation. He gave her a quick rundown of his predicament."Maybe Wesley just has a type-someone who ticks every box for him. No one else will ever measure up."

He offered a few more words of gentle advice, then hung up and trudged back to his lonely, exhausting labor.

Fiona refused to back down. Why couldn't she be the one Wesley wanted?

She wasn't about to surrender without a fight.

Recalling that Wesley's grandmother, Loretta, was notoriously superstitious, Fiona hatched a plan on the spot.

By noon the next day, Wesley's phone buzzed with a call from Loretta."Wesley, Fiona stopped by this morning. She straightened out the whole business with those WhatsApp curses-it was just some silly mix-up."

Wesley, juggling a stack of documents, answered with measured patience. But then Loretta said something that stopped him cold. "She wanted to talk things out in person, but you unfriended her. I told her to come see you at the office. When she gets there, you'd better treat her properly, and don't you dare send her away."

A furrow creased Wesley's brow.

What on earth had Fiona done to win Loretta over so completely, and so abruptly?

Now his grandmother was insisting Fiona show up at his office, forcing the issue right into his daily life. Was this Loretta's way of pushing him to accept Fiona, whether he liked it or not?

###Chapter 34 Dealing With Fiona


Wesley, though visibly irked, swallowed his frustration with Loretta. He forced out a measured response."Grandma, there are company rules. You'll need to schedule an appointment to see me, no exceptions."

Loretta wouldn't let it go. Her tone sharpened with disapproval. "Fiona's your friend. Why on earth would she need to book an appointment?" Her voice climbed another notch,fraught with indignation."Tell me,are you saying I'd have to make an appointment just to see my own grandson?"

Determined not to provoke her, Wesley softened his reply. "No, of course not..."

"Good, that's what I thought. And you'd better look after Fiona while she's there." Before Wesley could offer another word, Loretta ended the call with a decisive click.

Left staring at the silent phone, he mulled over his next move, still scrambling for a way to keep Fiona out of his office.

Gabriela knocked politely, then entered the office. "Mr. Moss, there's a woman outside-she says you two are close and insists on seeing you."

Wesley hadn't expected Fiona to show up so soon. His fingers drummed a restless beat on the desk before he forced his voice steady. "Tell her I've got a video meeting. Take her to the lounge for now."

"Got it."

With a composed nod, Gabriela led Fiona down the hall, quietly mentioning that Wesley was currently tied up with work.

Fiona, wrapped in a chic, delicate dress that barely shielded her from the biting wind, had made her way to Apex Group determined. Unexpected, she was greeted by a striking young woman-Gabriela-whose beauty needed no help from cosmetics, her complexion luminous and unblemished.

Confronted by such effortless elegance, Fiona felt a pang of insecurity twist through her chest.

 Gabriela found herself under Fiona's sharp, appraising stare. With a tone dripping arrogance, Fiona ordered,"Go make me a coffee. And make it just the way Wesley likes it."

Caught off guard by Fiona's easy command, Gabriela managed a polite, practiced smile. "Of course.Please wait a moment."

She hurried off, brewing the coffee exactly to Wesley's tastes before carefully setting the cup in front of Fiona.

But as soon as Fiona took a sip, her face twisted in disgust. Without warning, she spat the coffee directly onto Gabriela.

Hot liquid splatteredacross Gabriela's pristine white dress, soaking the fabric and blooming into a bold, ugly stain. She didn't cry out-years of enduring worse back in school had taught her restraint. Instead, she calmly took a step back, her face unreadable even as her immaculate appearance was ruined.

"Trying to scald me on purpose, are you?" Fiona pounced on Gabriela before she could react, voice dripping with contempt. "Unbelievable. You're this clumsy, yet you landed a spot in the executive office? What dirty tricks did you pull to get hired?"

Gabriela,having survived yearsof Phyllis's schemes, recognized animosity when she sawit.

But what had she done to provoke Fiona? For crying out loud! They'd never crossed paths before.

Although irritation simmered beneath her calm exterior, Gabriela kept her tone steady. "I was assigned heréthrough proper channels and all the standard procedures. If you're that curious, Ms. Dewitt, feel free to check with HR."

Fiona's gaze narrowed, laced with biting contempt. "Who said you could open your mouth? Don't think a pretty face and a little support from above can cover up how useless you are."

Just then, Billy strode in, his brows knitting together as he took in Gabriela's stained dress. "What's going on here?"

Before Gabriela could answer, Fiona lunged forward. "Mr. Clarke, is the executive office in the habit of hiring based on looks? She's unbelievable-she nearly dumped coffee all over me on purpose! I suggest you fire her immediately, or I'll take this straight to Wesley."

Billy ignored Fiona's accusations, simply offering her a courteous nod before turning to Gabriela. "Come with me."

Gabriela trailed behind Billy to the CEO's office. Wesley ended his call and set the phone aside, his gaze sharpening as Billy quietly summarized the situation.

Wesley's face clouded with displeasure. "Get her a clean set of clothes."

"Understood." Billy immediately strode out to take care of it himself.

With the office empty, Wesley's attention landed on Gabriela. "Well? Don't you have anything to say for yourself?"

Gabriela's shoulders stiffened as she met his eyes, refusing to answer. She pressed her lips together in silence.

What was there to say? Fiona's accusations were nothing but thinly veiled malice, and Gabriela had only swallowed her pride for the sake of her paycheck.

Wesley fixed her with a look of quiet reproach. "You're my personal secretary. If you let someone walk all over you, it reflects poorly on me."

A flicker of embarrassment crept into her cheeks at his words.

But Fiona's overly familiar tone when addressing Wesley suggested that they were close. With such a dynamic, how was Gabriela, a secretary, supposed to stand her ground?

Without another word, Wesley retrieved an official-looking document from his desk and handed it to Gabriela.

She took the document without hesitation, eyes scanning the bold print at the top.

It was a company-wide mandate urging all departments to cut back on water and electricity use.

Wesley spoke with crisp authority. "I'Il set the standard-starting with the CEO's office. Go turn off the heat. Make sure every department gets the message, and tell them I expect full cooperation."

"Yes,sir."

Gabriela gathered herself and strode out, still thrown by the sudden assignment.

She barely had time to process it before Billy showed up holding a fresh change of clothes. Grateful,Gabriela slipped away to the restroom, changed quickly, and then made the rounds, personally delivering the directive to each department.

The collective groan rippled through the office, but with Wesley leading the charge, even the most reluctant employees bundled up in heavy coats and shut off the heaters.

In the lounge, Fiona shivered as the room grew steadily colder.

Her coffee lost its warmth with each passing minute, and she silently cursed herself for not finishing it while it was still hot.

Now,with Billy and Gabriela gone, no one bothered to check on her. Isolated and freezing, Fiona's irritation simmered into rage.

She swore to herself she'd get them tossed out once she had the chance.

Gabriela returned from distributing the notices just as Wesley handed her a new assignment, his voice tinged with mischief. "Head to the lounge and watch the show. Things are about to getinteresting."

Gabriela couldn't decipher Wesley's real agenda, but after mulling it over, she suspected Fiona was just another persistent admirer whom he wanted her to quietly drive away.

Clearly, in this place, every ounce of value was squeezed from her. That generous salary came with more strings attached than she'd bargained for.

She eased open the lounge door an'd spotted Fiona perched stiffly on the couch.

Even bundled up, Gabriela felt the icy bite of winter pressing through the walls, but Fiona, who'd sacrificed warmth for style, sat trembling-her teeth nearly chattering as she struggled to look unfazed.The whole scene struck Gabriela as oddly amusing.

No sooner had she stepped inside than Fiona shot her a disgruntled glare. "Why did someone shut off the heat?"

Gabriela knew she couldn't blurt out that Wesley wanted to cut costs.

Instead, she put on a professional face and offered a harmless excuse. "The heating system's out. We've already called for repairs."

Fiona's icy glare made it obvious she didn't believe a word.

She thought Gabriela was throwing her weight around just to make her uncomfortable.

Who did this secretary think she was, daring to challenge her for Wesley's attention?

Spotting the tense set of Fiona's jaw, Gabriela kept her tone light but couldn't resist. "It's freezing in here.Are you sure you don't want to put on something warmer, Ms. Dewitt?" A flicker of concern crossed her face. "You're looking a little pale.Are you feeling under the weather?"

Just then, Billy stepped in, barely suppressing a laugh behind a forced cough.

Gabriela wasted no time, her tone light but pointed. "See? You've already managed to pass it on to Billy."

Fiona's composure shattered. Her cheeks flushed a furious crimson.

She had battled the bitter wind outside just to look flawless for Wesley-certainly not to become the punchline of Gabriela's barbs.
###Chapter 35 Pacifying Loretta


Billy found himself almost impressed with Gabriela. She could slice someone apart with words and never so much as ruffle a hair. It was no wonder Wesley had taken notice of her.

Fiona, bolstered by Loretta's promise to back her no matter what, shot back with sharp confidence, "And just who the hell do you think you are, talkingto me like that?"

Gabriela didn't so much as flinch. "You've got it wrong, Ms. Dewitt. I'm only worried about you," she said evenly.

Wesley had obviously planted her here to relish the scene, yet she still played her part, offering a polite veneer of concern.

That crisp white dress hadn't been cheap, and she doubted the coffee stain would ever come out. She was already being gracious by not demanding Fiona replace it. And still, Fiona had the audacity to twist things and act like she was the one being wronged.

"Worried about me?" Fiona's lip curled in a cold sneer."Come on, that fake sympathy might fool a man, but it won't work on me."

A deep, commanding voice cut in from behid Gabriela. "She's my secretary."

Wesley's tall frame loomed suddenly at her back, a solid wall of quiet authority. His gaze slid to Fiona, cool and unreadable. "So, what brings you here, bickering with my employee?"

The shift in Fiona's expression was instant. "Wesley, I'm freezing."

"Then go home and put on more clothes," he replied without the faintest warmth. His expression stayed cold, though his tone carried an edge of politeness. "Shall I have my assistant see you out?"

Billy stepped forward at once, ready to carry out the order without question.

Gabriela, watching from the side, felt a flicker of admiration. Fiona was laying on the helpless act thick-any other man would have been shrugging off his coat for her by now-but Wesley didn't so much as blink.

To a man who measured life in profit and loss, business clearly outweighed sentiment.

The chill in his manner caught Fiona off guard. She had expected even the barest show of tenderness,not this unyielding dismissal. Fighting back sobs, she turned on her heel and left Apex Group, her heels clicking an uneven rhythm on the polished floor.

In the car, she ordered the driver to head straight to Loretta's place. There, she sought out Loretta and spilled every grievance in a rush, her voice breaking with wounded indignation.

Yesterday,Loretta sought out a fortune-teller for Wesley's sake, only to be told that misfortune would shadow him after he turned thirty. The fortune-teller had claimed the only way to ward off the looming hardship was to marry a blessed woman-and Fiona,according to him, fit the bill perfectly.

Now, Loretta held the sobbing Fiona in her arms, murmuring gentle reassurances. She promised not only to stand up for her but also to make Wesley apologize directly to her.

Only after hearing this did Fiona wipe her tears and leave with a sense of satisfaction.

Keeping her word, Loretta wasted no time in calling Wesley. HHer voice was cold, almost cutting, as she ordered him to come over that evening, warning that if he refused, she would cut all ties with him.

The gravity in her tone made it clear she meant every word. Wesley ended his work in haste, grabbed his keys, and drove straight to her place.

Loretta's place was a modest, timeworn bungalow, yet inside it was warm, neat, and surprisingly inviting.Behind the house stretched a neat vegetable garden where Loretta grew her own greens.

This year's pride was a bed of onions, their bulbs plump and ready for harvest.

When Wesley stepped into the yard, he spotted her bent over in the rows, tugging stubbornly at the onions.

From a few steps away, he called out, "Grandma!"

But she didn't look up; she kept yanking up onions, grumbling under her breath. "I planted these onions myself, watered and weeded them all season... and now they've decided to cling to the ground like their lives depend on it."

Wesley could hear the subtext in her words and almost smiled. Rolling up his sleeves, he strolled over and said lightly, "Here-let me give you a hand, Grandma."

"Don't bother." Loretta's eyes narrowed, her voice clipped with disapproval. "You're the high-and-mighty CEO now-how could I possibly tell you what to do? I only asked you to keep Fiona company for a few hours,yet you sent her off in tears before noon. If I let you pull these onions, you'd probably trample half the garden."

She was a plainspoken village woman, stubborn as bedrock and utterly convinced of her own reasoning.Once her mind was set, no argument from the younger generation could sway her.

If Wesley so much as hesitated, she'd decide he'd grown arrogant and give him a tongue-lashing on the spot.

Understanding exactly how she was, Wesley did what he always did-he gave in.

Rolling up his sleeves, he bent to help her tug onions from the soil and, as he worked, offered an explanation. "It was freezing that morning, but Fiona dressed thin just to look good. The company's following orders from above to cut back on heating, and she ended up venting on one of my employees.That's exactly why I told her to leave."

Loretta faltered at his words, torn between her ingrained frugality and her irritation at Fiona's arrogant display.

Wesley pressed on, his tone cool but deliberate.secretary has a master's degree-higher than Fiona's credentials.She treated Fiona with respect, and Fiona repaid her by tossing coffee in her face."

"That was wrong of her," Loretta conceded after a beat. Though she quickly added in Fiona's defense, "But Fiona's a PhD student. How can a master's outrank that?"

Her gaze sharpened, the faint sting of pride creeping in. She suspected Wesley's remark wasn't just about Fiona-it was a subtle jab at her own lack of schooling, a reminder she was only a village woman. "The program Fiona attended overseas was nothing but a finishing school for the rich," Wesley said evenly.
"Aplace where trust fund babies pad their résumés. Here, that kind of degree isn't worth much. But my secretary graduated from Rutherford University-one of the most prestigious schools in the country."

Caught off guard, Loretta said, "I thought PhDs were supposed to be valuable."

"That depends," Wesley countered with a faint scoff. "I should take you out more and let you see the world for yourself. Things aren't always the way people make them sound."

Loretta lapsed into thoughtful silence, and he went on, "My secretary's a top graduate, hardworking, never once at fault. The decision not to use the heating was mine, yet Fiona decided to vent her temper on my secretary. Why? Simply because she has a powerful family name to hide behind."

In just a few lines, Wesley painted a bright, accomplished young woman unfairly targeted by an overbearing socialite.

Loretta's expression softened at once.

Wesley caught the opening. "Fiona didn't just throw a tantrum-she spoke to my secretary with outright disrespect. That's rude."

Loretta let out a sigh. "I thought Fiona was a refined young lady. Who knew she'd behave like this!"

Wesley hid his satisfaction. Her anger toward him faded, along with any thought of pairing him with Fiona.

A woman with that kind of wild, unruly streak could never be a proper bride.

After pacifying Loretta and sharing a warm meal with her, Wesley headed back home.

Fiona, certain Wesley would call to apologize, waited with growing anticipation-but as the hours crept into night, there was still no word from him. To make matters worse, she caught a chill, her nose running and sneezes coming one after another.

The irritation that came with feeling ill only sharpened her temper, and in a fit of impatience, she dialed Loretta's number.

This time, Loretta's tone was far from the doting warmth she'd shown before. She claimed she was getting old and didn't want to meddle in the disputes of the younger generation anymore.

Before hanging up, she even murmured a quiet, "Good luck."

Even with Fiona's difficult nature, Loretta couldn't fully shake the fortune-teller's prophecy-that Fiona was a blessed woman.If Fiona and Wesley did marry, perhaps her sharp edges would wear down over time.

But right now, Fiona burned with anger. Loretta's aloofness stung like a slap.

She'd spent so much effort weaving her way into Wesley's orbit-even paying a fortune-teller to paint the perfect picture of their destined match. And this was all she got in return?

She had no idea Wesley remained oblivious to the depth of her despair, to the way she now questioned her own worth. Even if he knew, he wouldn't have cared.

Back at his own place, Wesley scrolled through his WhatsApp thread with Gabriela, his mood souring with each message.

He had cleared every obstacle for her, laid the ground so she could advance toward him-and yet, she hadn't taken a single step. Not even a simple thank-you.

What a sly little ingrate!

###Chapter 36 Her Punishment For Crossing Wesley


While Wesley's irritation mounted, Gabriela remained wrapped in her perfect, unknowing bliss.

After work, she dashed to the dry cleaners, clutching her coffee-splattered dress.

But the moment the clerk quoted her $120, she balked andsnatched it back.

She'd just landed in the executive office-no telling how long she'd survive-and her first paycheck was nowhere in sight. Now was not the time to splurge.

She trudged home, dress in hand, only to spot Phyllis shivering on the front steps, stubbornly braving the cold.

Gabriela feigned ignorance, angling to slip past unnoticed.

But Phyllis, sharp-eyed as ever, instantly clocked the brand of Gabriela's dress and sidestepped to block her. "Home early for once, aren't you, Gabriela?" Phyllis drawled, voice thick with implication."Did your boyfriend buy you that dress?"

Gabriela, focused on getting the stain out, shot back with a clipped, "What's it to you?"

Phyllis's lips curved into a mock-sympathetic smile. "Don't say I didn't warn you. The more those rich men spend, the more they expect from you."

Gabriela glanced over her shoulder, a sly grin breaking through. "Are you actually worried about me, or just green with envy? Either way, you'restill stuck on the outside looking in."

During her school days, Gabriela had been too busy hustling for tuition to bother with high-end labels.She hadn't realized how expensive the dress was-then Phyllis's razor-sharp tone said it all.

After putting Phyllis in her place, Gabriela hurried off to scrub her dress clean, leaving Phyllis standing in the freezing air, burning with envy.

Phyllis seethed, unable to comprehend how Gabriela, once the timid girl she'd bossed around in school,had suddenly grown a spine.

The more she dwelled on it, the more it unsettled her. She racked her brain, but couldn't figure out what had changed. All she knew was she couldn't let it go.

With her wedding to Dustin less than three weeks away Phyllis was supposed to be basking in bridal bliss,but instead, she tossed and turned each night, furious at the sight of Gabriela parading around in luxury labels that even she couldn't afford. It gnawed at her, that Gabriela-of all people--dared to flaunt such things right under her nose.

She couldn't possibly wait for the wedding to put Gabriela in her place. The thought of humiliating Gabriela was the only thing that would let her rest easy.

Phyllis mulled over her next move, then pulled out her phone and dialed Rhys without hesitation.

Gabriela had ditched her blind date with Rhys, and though he still felt slighted, he kept his tone courteous when Phyllis reached out-after all, she was a Haynes.

"Mr. Fox, I truly apologize for how things went with Gabriela last time," she said, her voice syrupy with forced warmth.

Her reverent tone made Rhys feel unexpectedly important. He replied with cloyingeagerness, "How can l help you today,Phyllis?"

His forced cordiality made Phyllis want to gag, but she kept her friendly mask firmlyin place. "You know,Gabriela and I are about the same age, but she always finds ways to make the family worry.I was-hoping you might help me talk some sense into her."

She laid out her plan, then lavished him with praise for his education and fine character, leaving him grinning with pride.

Rhys relished his sense of superiority. "If she'd been half as sensible as you, she wouldn't have bailed on our blind date."

Phyllis let out a delicate sigh. "Gabriela's just obsessed with money, but real work? She wants nothing to do with it. She's always on the lookout for shortcuts-that's how she lost her way. But honestly, she isn't a bad person deep down."

Phyllis continued, "Right now, she's only with that old, unattractive guy because he showers her with expensive gifts. If you'd just talk to her, maybe spend a little time together, I'm sure she'd start to realize how capable you are. She might even find her way back."

After mocking Gabriela, Phyllis kept piling on the flattery to Rhys, insisting he was the only genuinely exceptional man she'd ever met. With a helpless smile, she confessed that he was her last hope.

If he could help steer Gabriela back on track, she'd owe him a debt she'd never forget-one she'd be grateful for the rest of her life.

"Fine. Since you insist, I'll play along." Rhys tossed out a scornful laugh. "But let's get something straight-she's absolutely not my type. I don't waste my time on that kind of trash."

Phyllis thanked him in a rush, her relief barely concealed.

His biting contempt was exactly what she needed. All she wanted was a pompous loudmouth to stir up trouble for Gabriela.

Rhys fit the bill perfectly: arrogant, seIf-satisfied, and shamelessly theatrical. He'd make sure every juicy detail of Gabriela's life was dragged out into the open, then shrug it off like he was doing her a favor-claiming he'd still "help" her, even as her reputation crumbled.

Under such circumstances, how could Gabriela possibly keep her footing at the company? Would Wesley still hold her in such high regard?

At the same time, Gabriela spent nearly an hour scrubbing the coffee stain from the dress, then threw her own outfit into the wash.

By morning, everything was spotless. She carefully folded the clothes, stuffed them in a bag, and headed for the office, hoping to slip in quietly and return them to Wesley.

But the moment she walked through the doors, she could feel dozens of eyes tracking her every move.When she reached the executive office, she finally spotted the source of all the attention-a stunning arrangement of red roses overflowing on the reception desk. The receptionist beckoned her over with a mischievous grin. "Well, look at you, Gabriela. Flowers before you've even clocked in? Someone's clearly got it bad."

Gabriela eyed the enormous bouquet, her confusion mounting as she struggled to make sense of the scene.Before she could gather her thoughts, Wesley strode into the office.

The room was filled with a chorus of respectful "Good morning, Mr.Moss."

Gabriela echoed the greeting,her voice faint.

Wesley's gaze paused on her, lingering over the roses for a tense, loaded three seconds. Without a word, he turned and vanished into his office, the heavy air in his wake making his irritation impossible to miss.

Billy hurried after him, then stopped and addressed Gabriela with quiet urgency. "Gabriela, could you come with me for a moment?"

Clutching the extravagant bouquet, Gabriela trailed after him, her nerves tight, completely at a loss as to what she'd just walked into.

Wesley lounged behind his imposing desk, exuding the air of a judge about to hand down a harsh verdict.

Gabriela's nerves fluttered-she had a sinking feeling that those showy red roses had put him in a foul mood.

"I can explain," she blurted, rushing the words out before she lost her nerve.

Wesley barely acknowledged her, his gaze fixed somewhere past her shoulder, a wall of indifference.

For a fleeting moment, Gabriela wondered if his sour mood really had anything to do with her.

She hesitated only a heartbeat before offering the neatly folded clothes, hoping to defuse whatever storm was brewing.

Wesley didn't spare the clothes a second look. Instead, his steely eyes zeroed in on the bouquet in her arms, lips curving with the ghost of a sneer.

Gabriela flung the roses onto a side table. "I have no idea who sent these.."
Her voice caught as she glimpsed the name scrawled on the card: Rhys Fox.

It buzzed somewhere in her memory, but she couldn't place it.

Wesley's eyes darkened, his patience clearly fraying. "My office doesn't accept returns. Especially not after you've worn them."

He was sharper than usual today, his annoyance radiating across the room. Flustered, Gabriela turned to Billy, silently pleading for help.

Instead, Billy just twisted the knife. "You might as well keep them. The amount will be taken out of your paycheck."

Gabriela ventured softly, "Mr. Clarke, could you tell me how much these cost?"

Billy tossed out a price that dwarfed Gabriela's monthly salary, leaving her reeling in disbelief.

All at once, it clicked-Fiona wasn't simply another lovesick nuisance buzzing around Wesley. The two of them were in on it together.

Fiona's mission was to rattle her nerves, sowing chaos with sharp words and petty sabotage, while Wesley,under the guise of helpfulness, tightened the screws with every new hardship he piled onto her life.

So this was her punishment for crossing Wesley.

Gabriela kept her fury buried deep, knowing she couldn't risk an outburst around him, but promised herself that if Fiona ever showed her face again, she'd return the favor tenfold.

Elsewhere, Fiona, still plagued by her stubborn cold, let out another harsh, unrefined sneeze.

###Chapter 37 His Personal Chef


A heavy mood lingered in the office, a hush settling over the space like a fog.

Wesley abruptly looked up, his eyes shadowed with layersof emotion that revealed nothing.

He fixed Gabriela with a penetrating stare. "Are you unhappy with my decision?"

Gabriela responded instantly, shaking her head in denial.

She prided herself on her sense of fairness-she always drew a clear line between right and wrong.

Even though Wesley had cut her pay, she knew the real culprit was Fiona, who had stirred up the trouble in the first place. Gabriela fully intended to make Fiona pay for it.

In her mind, she had already crafted the perfect plan to turn the tables. Next time Fiona tried anything,she'd find out exactly what it felt like to be on the losing side.

Noticing Gabriela's willingness to admit fault and the way she'd swiftly dealt with the bouquet, Wesley's sternness eased. "Since this is your first mistake, I'll let it slide-no salary deduction," he stated, voice smooth and controlled.

Gabriela hadn't dared hope for this outcome. Relief and gratitude brightened her face, her eyes shining like jewels as she offered a sincere thanks.

Wesley forced himself to look 'away, maintaining his composure. "Starting today, you're in charge of my lunch."

Cooking was second nature to Gabriela, but she worried about squeezing it into her packed schedule. Still,she nodded, determined.

"You can use the kitchen here," Wesley added, gesturing toward the glass door.

Only then did Gabriela recall the private kitchen adjoining his office. She assured him that his meals would always be up to standard. Watching the scene unfold, Billy stood frozen, too stunned to say a word.

In that moment, he felt certain-Gabriela held a unique place in Wesley's world.

He wasted no time lingering, hustling Wesley through the morning's urgent signatures before making a discreet exit.

As the clock struck eleven, a delivery of crisp produce arrived, and Gabriela hurried into the kitchen, her determination palpable.

She poured her energy into preparing a handful of classic comfort dishes, finishing with a steaming pot of borscht, intent on impressing Wesley with every detail.

At twelve-ten, her phone buzzed. Aubrey's cheerful voice crackled through. "Gabriela, I grabbed us a table!When are you heading over? Want me to pick up your lunch?"

Reserving a seat in the company cafeteria had become a silent ritual between them-whoever got there first always saved a spot, an unspoken promise in the bustle of company life.

Gabriela replied, "Don't worry about it. I'mnot eating in the cafeteria today."

Aubrey blinked, curiosity bubbling in her voice. "Oh? Got lunch plans with Mr. Moss again?"

With a sly grin, Gabriela explained, "Not quite. I'm doubling as his personal chef now."

Aubrey's eyes widened, her excitement impossible to contain. "Wait, you're seriously cooking for him?Gabriela,that's huge!"

Who could have guessed that culinary skills might actually pave the way to career advancement?

Aubrey found herself tempted to sharpen her culinary skills, while Gabriela couldn't have been more indifferent.

If Gabriela hadn't felt compelled to repay Wesley for that outrageously pricey outfit, she wouldn't be juggling two jobs right now.

Meanwhile, Aubrey's loud words drifted over to the three colleagues at the next table-ironically, the same ones who'd trashed Gabriela's name in the restroom days ago. Now, every ounce of color had drained from their faces.

Gabriela,actually cooking for Wesley? She had really caught his eye lately.

Just thinking about their own careless gossip, each of them squirmed with embarrassment,especially Cali,who felt an icy sweat break out as dread snaked its way down her back.

Nobody could say how long Gabriela's good fortune would last, but for now, her approval from Wesley meant any of them could be out if she just said the word.

Unbeknownst to Gabriela, her new job as Wesley's personal chef had put those three colleagues on edge.

She arranged the lunch spread-a platter of smoky barbecue ribs, tender steamed cod, a hearty pot of borscht, and a colorful sauté of fresh vegetables-making sure everything looked inviting before she called Wesley in to eat.

He took his seat, eyes landing on the borscht. For the first time, a subtle smile touched his lips. "This actually looks normal today."

Remembering her seasoning mishap from last time, Gabriela flushed, guilt prickling at her cheeks. "I've made a note of everything you like, Mr. Moss. You won't find a single ingredient you dislike from now on."

Wesley, visibly satisfied, gestured for her to take a seat beside him at the table.

Gabriela wavered, her voice barely above a whisper. "I...I really shouldn't."

Every instinct warned her that sharing a meal with Wesley was a gamble. His temperament could shift in an instant, and she knew better than to presume too much.

Wesley had a knack for bending her will to match his own.

He leaned back, an amused glint in his eyes. "Dinner won't start until someone samples the dishes."

Gabriela stared at him, stunned into silence.

Only a man like Wesley Moss could turn an ordinary meal into such a spectacle. If he was so afraid of being poisoned, why put her in charge of his meals in the first place?

Sliding into her seat, Gabriela took a careful bite from each dish, finishing them all in a matter of moments.She met Wesley's gaze with a bright, earnest smile. "You have nothing to worry about, Mr. Moss. Everything I make is perfectly safe."

Wesley seemed pleased, nodding his approval. "In tha case, let's eat together."

Somehow, Gabriela had morphed from a reluctant chef into to an impromptu food taster and Wesley's unwilling lunch companion.

She could hardly keep track of how many roles she'd filled for him already.

Maybe it was because lunch turned out just the way Wesley liked it, and he didn't give her a single hard time for the rest of the day. Before she knew it, the workday was over.

For once, she didn't have to stay late. As she left the office right at six, a wave of pure relief nearly sent her skipping down the street.

Her brief burst of joy evaporated almost instantly.

There he was-the man from her ill-fated blind date-was propped up against a gleaming white Audi at the curb, clutching a bouquet of roses.

It hit Gabriela all at once. The mysterious bouquet she'd received that morning-those gaudy red roses-had been from him.

The memory of his slick pickup lines made her lips tighten in distaste. She veered sharply, determined to sidestep him entirely.

No such luck. Rhys spotted her right away, waving the flowers like a flag. With her striking features and magnetic energy, Gabriela drew every pair of eyes on the street.

Rhys strode up, a smug grin on his face, and called out, "Gabriela, done for the day? I've been standing here ages! Did those roses I sent brighten your morning?"

He acted as if she'd personally invited him to wait, his voice dripping with an insistent familiarityGabriela's irritation simmered while curious colleagues snuck glances, their whispersblending into a low hum behind her.

She edged away, holding her chin high. "I'm afraid we're not that close, Mr. Fox. It's Miss Haynes to you."

Rhys closed the gap, brandishing a bright smile. "Feeling shy, are you, Gabriela? Honestly, both our families are thrilled about us. Phyllis couldn't stop talking about how much you love roses. That's why I went out of my way to get these white ones for you."

Rhys pressed the bouquet insistently toward her, but Gabriela sidestepped with a brisk shake of her head."I'm afraid roses aren't my thing. Why don't you let the trash can enjoy them instead?"

Recognition flickered across Rhys's face as the truth hit him-she had tossed the pricey bouquet he'd sent that morning.

He'd dropped a small fortune on those flowers!

The realization soured his expression, frustration knotting his features.

"Who do you think you are?" he snapped, his voice rising. "Don't go thinking you're so special. Being pretty doesn't mean every guy is desperate to chaseafter you."

Gabriela's jaw tightened, her patience snapping. "Then get out of my sight."

Rhys barked out a stunned laugh. "You seriously think you can talk to me like that?" He squared his shoulders, eyes flashing. "Your family practically begged me to give you a chance, pleading with me not to write you off! I only bothered to'show up as a favor to Phyllis-she and I go way back to college. Otherwise, I wouldn't have wasted my time."

He stepped in close, voice rising. "Your family already agreed to us. Whether you want it or not, you're leaving with me today."

Initially, Rhys agreed just to indulge'his flattered ego, but Gabriela's beauty kept replaying in his mind.

Now,the decision was made. He wasn't going to back down. As far as he was concerned, the blind date and her family's approval gave him every right. No one else got a say. Without warning, Rhys seized Gabriela's arm in a bruising grip and tried to haul her toward his car.


###Chapter 38 My People


Rhys's arm grazed Gabriela's, and a cold wave of disgust rippled through her.

"Let go, or I'm calling the police," she snapped, her voice sharp enough to cut glass.

His lips curled into a smug, almost taunting grin. "Please. Police don't step in when a guy's just putting his girlfriend in her place."

Some of Gabriela's colleagues nearby shifted uneasily, glancing at each other but not moving to help.Then Rhys's voice rose, laced with venom. "She's my girlfriend! Been running around with some wrinkled sugar daddy for a couple of fancy dresses and handbags-cheating on me the whole time. And today? I'm teaching her a lesson. So stay out of it!"

Eyes turned on Gabriela, some edged with disbelief, most with quiet contempt.

With her looks, they thought, it wasn't hard to believe she'd trade affection for luxury-and worse, betray the man she was with. Chasing after some rich old man-how utterly vile and humiliating.

Gabriela froze,blindsided by the sheer brazenness of his lie. Her voice rang out, sharp and clear. "Don't listen to him! He's not my boyfriend!"

"Oh, really?" Rhys's lips curled in a mocking sneer. "Then why did you take my flowers?" His gaze turned cold, his tone shifting into something more like an order. "Come home with me and apologize. If I'm ina good mood, I'll still buy you the pretty things you like."

Gabriela twisted hard against his grip, panic tightening in her chest.

If he got her into that car, there was no telling what he might do.

In one swift motion, she swung her'free arm and struck him-her palm connecting with his cheek in a sharp,echoing crack.

Rhys froze, eyes wide in shock, one hand pressed against the reddening welt on his cheek. Whatever false polish he'd worn a moment ago shattered, replaced by a snarl. "You filthy whore! Who do you think you are,hitting me?"

His arm shot up, rage twisting his features as he prepared to strike back.

One of Gabriela's wrists was still trapped in his iron grip, her muscles straining in vain. Panic clawed at her chest-his shadow loomed over her, the blow seconds fom landing.

Before it could fall, a strong hand caught Rhys's wrist in midair, fingers locking like a vise.

Startled, Rhys whipped hishead around, fury still blazing-only to find a tall man in a tailored black suit,his expression unreadable.

"Get lost! This is none of your damn business!" Rhys snapped, his voice.trembling with indignation.

Billy, the man in the black suit, flicked a glance toward Wesley, who stood a short distance away.

Wesley's usual composure was laced with icy disdain, his eyes cutting sharp as if to say, "Do I really need to spell this out for you?"

Billy understood at once. His jaw set, and his fingers clamped down like a steel vice.

A sharp crack echoed, and Rhys let out a strangled howl. "Who the hell are you? What do you want? My hand's gonna break-let go!"

Instead, Billy's grip only tightened.

Pain drained the color from Rhys's face, cold sweat beading along his temples. With a choked gasp, he finally wrenched his fingers free of Gabriela.

Gabriela shook free at last and made her way toward Wesley, only to be met by the chill in his eyes-a look that froze her in place.

A realization struck her. She'd just dragged the company's name through the mud.

Wordlessly, she slipped to the side, hoping to make herself small.

But Wesley pivoted, his gaze locking on her like a hawk's. His voice was low, clipped, and brooked no The edge in his tone made her stomach tighten. She moved at once, steps small and careful, slipping in behind him.

Around them, the crowd stirred with a ripple of astonishment.

So the whispers had been true after all-Wesley did treat Gabriela diferently. And this was no idle workplace rumor; everyone could see it now, plain as day.

Maybe Wesley's protectiveness toward Gabriela ran deeper than anyone had guessed-why else would he let Billy stand up for her?

Regret rippled through the crowd. If they'd known she truly had Wesley's favor, they wouldn't have stayed frozen on the sidelines.

No one kicked themselves harder than Cali and her two friends-they'd squandered their one chance to make amends, and now the window had slammed shut.

"Help..." Rhys's panicked shout cracked in the air before he collapsed to his knees, desperation twisting his features. "Please, sir-let's just talk! Let me go, I'm begging you!"

Billy's grip looked deceptively casual, but the tension in his forearm told anoter story-his control was absolute, the kind that came from years of disciplined training. Rhys felt as if his wrist were one breath away from breaking.

That was the moment it hit him-he had just gone head-to-head with the wrong kind of people.

Billy's gaze turned razor-sharp. "Apex Group isn't your playground. Step foot here again, and I'll make sure you get a beating."

Rhys bobbed his head frantically, his voice trembling. "Y-yes, I was ignorant. I swear, I'l never come near the company again."

He understood that Billy was merely the guard dog. The true master stood a few steps away.

Rhys turned toward Wesley, desperation twisting his face. "Sir, I swear l've learned my lesson.Please, just let me off this time!"

Wesley lifted a hand in a subtle,dismissive wave.

Billy instantly released Rhys and closed the distance to Wesley's side, posture taut, waiting for the next command.

Wesley closed the distance in long, deliberate strides, his shadow swallowing Rhys where he stood.

"Which hand did you use to lay a finger on my people?" HHis voice was quiet, but it cut through the air like a blade.

Gabriela's heart, which had only just begun to steady, lurched painfully in her chest.

The protectiveness in his words sent her emotions into a whirlwind.

Rhys shrank back under the weight of Wesley's gaze, his bravado dissolving. Swallowing hard, he extended his right hand like a schoolboy confessing a crime.

Wesley's eyes narrowed, cold and unyielding, the look in them making it clear-Rhys was going to deal with this himself, or suffer worse.

Rhys grasped the situation instantly. He raised his right hand and smacked himself across the face, each blow sharp and echoing, spitting out curses at himself between strikes.

Wesley didn't waste another glance on him. With a cold, unhurried stride, he headed toward the parking lot.

After a few steps, he realized 'Gabriela wasn't beside him. He glanced over his shoulder, his expression sharp, that chiseled face as,cold as marble.

Startled, Gabriela quickly fell into step, hurrying after him and sliding into the car.

The colleagues who had witnessed it all stood frozen, still trying to process what they'd seen. Wesley wasn't just protecting Gabriela-he was going out of his way for her.

Rhys stood utterly defeated-hundreds squandered on roses, every last shred of dignity ripped away in front of the crowd. The moment Wesley's car disappeared from sight, he yanked out his phone and ordered a ride to the hospital.

The examination was brutal on his pride-a shattered fracture in his wrist, the kind that would take days just to ease the pain, let alone heal.

Rage bubbled up in his chest, and he spat venom through clenched teeth. "You damn bitch, Gabriela! Sure,your boss is backing you now. Let's see how long that luck sticks. Next time, you won't be so fortunate!Damn! How dare you act like an unattainable princess around me while spreading your legs for some old sugar daddy? Who the hell do you think you're fooling?"

Before his tirade could burn out, his phone buzzed with Phyllis's name flashing across the screen. He answered, unleashing another string of curses, his voice sharp with spite.

Phyllis listened, her tone softening into a feigned sigh. "Ever since we were kids, she's been stirring up trouble-and somehow, there's always a guy ready to shield her. Sorry you got caught up in this."

The apology only seemed to stoke Rhys's fury.

His jaw tightened, and a dark promise formed in his mind-he would make Gabriela pay, and soon.

On the drive back, Wesley remained silent, his profile as unreadable as stone.

Gabriela kept her gaze fixed on the window, hands folded tightly in her lap, every bump in the road echoing the tension in her chest. Her thoughts looped back to the moment he'd stood up for her.

Still, she forced herself to reason it away-he'd likely done it because the company's reputation was at stake.

Gabriela felt uneasy under,his deep, unreadable gaze, worried he might cut her paycheck in half for the earlier commotion.

When the car slowed near her street, she broke the silence, forcing a polite smile. "Thank you for stepping in today, Mr. Moss. I'll work twice as hard to repay your kindness."

Wesley's low laugh was cool and edged, his eyes flickering with a trace of mockery.

"I swear it won't happen again," she added quickly. "I won't bring any more shame to the company." Her expression made it painfully obvious-she was pleading with him not to cut her salary.

Somehow, the sight only tightened something in his chest. His jaw hardened, and his voice dropped to a curt rumble. "See that you don't."

###Chapter 39 Argument


Gabriela had barely stepped out of the car when Wesley's face hardened into something grim and unyielding, the air around him turning frigid with menace.

Billy sat rigid, not daring to move an inch.

He had never seen Wesley like this before. Even when Brenden had pushed his limits, Wesley's temper had been measured-at most, a cutting glare or a clipped reprimand. But now, the cold fury radiating off him was almost suffocating.

With a slow breath, Wesley shut his eyes, forcing the storm inside him to settle. His hand went to his tie,loosening it with a sharp tug. "Look into that guy," he said, his voice low but edged like a blade.

"Got it, sir," Billy answered at once.

"And make sure he never gets close to Gabriela again," Wesley added through clenched teeth.

The image of what could have happened if he'd arrived seconds later clawed at Wesley's mind.

The idea of her being dragged away-harmed, vulnerable-made his blood run hot and his muscles coil with a savage, near-uncontrollable urge to destroy.

Meanwhile, Gabriela stayed locked to the spot, watching Wesley's car melt into the twilight until its taillights bled away in the distance. Shedrew in a steadying breath, squared her shoulders, and stepped inside.

Today, she was damn well going to make Phyllis pay.

But the moment she crossed the living room threshold, Phyllis pounced, her voice sharp with accusation."Rhys brought you flowers today to make you happy. In the middle of winter, he stood shivering outside your office for quite a while, waiting for you. And what did you do? You had someone rough him up and snap his wrist! I heard it won't heal for months!"

A slow, icy smile tugged at Gabriela's lips. "He got exactly what he had coming." Phyllis's tone rose, brimming with indignation. "How can you be so heartless? Rhys was willing to look past your shortcomings and give you another chance-all because of me! You should be grateful and try to get along with him. Instead, you humiliated him in public and tossed his bouquet straight in the trash.How could you be so cruel?"

Phyllis's agitation mounted, as if Gabriela had committed some grave, irredeemable sin.

Josh's gaze hardened with quiet reproach. "You crossed a line, Gabriela. If your mother were still here,she would never stand for you disgracing the family like this."

For a beat, Gabriela stood motionless, her features unreadable, though a flicker of something dark stirred in her eyes.

"That's right," Phyllis chimed in, voice laced with indignation. "Rhys is livid. I've been going out of my way to smooth things over, but nothing works. All because of you, I upset him and threw away a valuable friendship."

"If my mother were still here..." Gabriela's voice came soft at first, almost a whisper. Then she lifted her head, her eyes locking sharply on Phyllis and Josh. "If she were still here, she'd never let you-some conniving bitch-steal my room, kick me awake in the dead of night, or ban me from my own bed. And she sure as hell wouldn't stand by while you snatched my clothes and shoes, or forced me to grind through high school just to scrape up tuition."

Phyllis's expression twisted in shock as she retorted, "You're lying! This house is in my mother's name-"

"If my mother were still here, she'd never force me into a blind date with some greasy creep. No way would she let that asshole come to my workplace, spewing crap about me, and try to drag me into a car for all to see." Gabriela's voice cut like a blade, each word sharpwith unshakable conviction, her eyes blazing with unrestrained fury.

Phyllis instinctively backed away, step after stumbling step, until she collapsed onto the sofa, her face drained of color.

Gabriela closed in, looming over her, eyes blazing like a predator locking onto prey. "I don't know how much Rhys paid you off, but get this through your head-if he so much as shows his face near me again, I'll make sure you pay the price right alongside him."

The meek, long-suffering Gabriela who once swallowed every insult was gone, replaced by a woman fierce enoughto make the air between them feel dangerous.

A glacial sharpness burned in Gabriea's gaze, freezing Phyllis mid-breath.

Josh stood rooted to the spot, his thoughts in disarray.

Gabriela's sharp retort clashed starkly with everything his wife had told him.

He knew Phyllis could be a little spoiled, but he'd always brushed it off as harmless bickering between1 girls.Never had it crossed his mind that Gabriela carried such deep, simmering resentment.

His complexion drained of color, and for a moment, he didn't know which side to take.

Then Phyllis jolted back from her stunned silence, fury snapping her out of it. "Are you out of your mind,Gabriela? Your mother died young-gone before you even turned eight! Well, she spared herself the shame of seeing the disappointment you became. If it weren't for my mom, you'd have starved in some gutter.She put food in your mouth, clothes on your back, and paid your way through college-and now you're after my family's property? What kind of heartless creature are you?"

Her voice rose to a screech as she shoved at Gabriela's shoulders.

Gabriela could have walked away, could have swallowed her anger like she'd done countless times before.But when her late mother was mentioned, something inside her snapped.

Without a second's hesitation, šhe seized a fistful of Phyllis's hair,yanking her head back.

"You've been stealing what's mine since we were kids," she spat, her voice low and trembling with rage."Spreading lies, dragging my name through filth. You sent rascals after me in high school, and now you've planted a sleazy man outside my office to corner me. Tell me, how do you live with yourself being such a rotten piece of shit?"

Gabriela had always prided herself on her control-on never letting cruelty get under her skin.

Phyllis's petty jabs had never been worth more than a dismissive glance; even the bullying she endured as a child hadn't cut as deep as the little irritations life threw at her day after day.

With age and experience, she'd learned to see Phyllis's schemes for what they were-small,spiteful garnes that barely deserved a reaction. Still, some wounds, no matter how trivial, never truly healed. They lingered like faint scars, invisible until something pressed on them.

And after Rhys's humiliating stunt today, those stains flared to the surface. Her coworkers' muffled laughter and sly glances followed her like a shadow. She could fake indifference and keep her chin high and her smile steady, but Wesley had been there. He'd seen the spectacle.

What was he thinking now?

He wasn't just her boss-he was the man she'd silently admired above all others, the man she could never afford to let see her as pathetic.

Gabriela's fury mounted as she lashed out, her fingers digging in tighter.

Phyllis's scalp burned under the merciless grip, her shrieks cutting through the air as she thrashed and clawed, desperate to pry Gabriela's hands away.

"Dad, help me! She's lost her fucking mind!" Phyllis wailed, her voice cracking.

Josh froze, utterly unprepared for the chaos unfolding before him.

His gaze darted from Gabriela-her expression shadowed, jaw clenched in pure rage-to Phyllis,who had lashed out with vicious words at Gabriela's late mother.

The insult snapped something in him. For the first time in years, anger surged up and overrode his hesitation. His hand came down hard across Phyllis's cheek. "Shut your mouth. Show some respect for your deceased aunt!"

The sharp crack echoed in the room. Both women halted, stunned by the sudden intervention. Gabriela's grip instinctively tightened in the silence that followed, and with a sickeningrip, a thick tuft of Phyllis's hair tore free.

A sharp tearing sound split the air, followed by Phyllis's piercing scream. The sudden sting and rush of cold air on her scalp left her frozen for a beat.

Then her eyes widened in horror at the fistful of hair in Gabriela's hand. She touched the tender bald patch,gasping, before lunging at Gabriela in a wild frenzy.

"I'll fucking tear you apart!" she shrieked.

Josh caught Phyllis before she could hit Gabriela, creating some distance between them.

Gabriela lowered her gaze to the dark tangle of hair in her fist, her breathing gradually steadying.

She smoothed her own mussed hair back, then fixed Phyllis with an icy glare. "Tell Rhys-if he shows his face to harass me again, I'll have him thrown in jail."

Without another glance, she carried the clump of hair like a trophy and strode toward her room,her steps sharp and deliberate.

Josh and Phylis were left standing in the living room, the heavy silence stretching between them like a noose.

Phyllis thrashed even harder, her voice breaking with outrage. "Dad, you actually hit me? How could you?Look at GGabriela-so smug and arrogant! Rhys is willing to ignore her dalliance with some sugar daddy,yet she still treats him like dirt. And she hit me first!"

Josh stood rooted to the spot, confusion clouding his features, unable to decide who was telling the truth.

He couldn't fathom why the two of them were locked in such a bitter conflict.

For Gabriela, years of swallowing Phyllis's petty torments had finally paid off in this single, gratifying moment.

Even if Phyllis and Marie twisted the story and Josh took their side later, she still felt untouchable.

She set the clump of hair into a delicate box as if it were a rare keepsake, snapped a photo, and uploaded it to her WhatsApp status.

The caption read "A Meaningful Trophy"-a post visible exclusively to Phyllis.
###Chapter 40 Josh's Guilt


Fresh from a hot shower, Gabriela was ready to crawl into bed when her phone erupted with an unending stream of notifications. The screen lit up again and again-every one from Phyllis.

"You've got one minute to remove that post-don't test me."

"Give me back my hair, now!"

"You rotten witch! I'll make you pay, sooner or later!"

Phyllis had clearly seen the photo Gabriela had posted. Rage practically dripped from every word, as if she wished she could rip Gabriela apart with her bare hands. But lacking the nerve to confront her in person, she hid behind her phone, firing off venom from a safe distance.

One message followed another-ten in quick succession-each packed with insults sharper than the last, a relentless barrage meant to claw under Gabriela's skin.

Still basking in her good mood, Gabriela typed back with unhurried confidence. "Screenshots saved."

The torrent of abuse cut off instantly. Moments later, Phyllis called, her voice ragged with fury. "What the hell do you want, Gabriela?"

Gabriela's tone was almost lazy. "That's something you should be asking yourself. Just pray Rhys doesn't cross my path tomorrow. Because every stunt he's pulled on me? I'll make sure you suffer it ten times worse."

On the other end, Phyllis faltered, memories flashing of the wild punks Gabriela had run with in high school.The thought made her jaw tighten-but she swallowed her resentment and fell silent.

Her fingers brushed the sore spot on her scalp where the hair had been ripped out, a mix of fear and simmering hatred twisting in her chest. Inwardly, she swore she'd bide her time and make Gabriela pay for it.

Gabriela's phone finally fell silent. Deciding Phyllis wasn't worth another second of her evening, she tossed it aside, set her alarm, and resolved to be up early.

Wesley had gone out of his way to help her today; the least she could do was prepare an extravagant breakfast to thank him.

She had just pulled the covers over herself when a sharp knock echoed through the quiet.

Annoyance flared instantly. Certain it was Phyllis trying to push her luck, Gabriela strode to the door with her jaw tight and her glare ready.

But when she swung it open, Josh stood there.

Gabriela's anger still clung to her like static, and Josh's eyes flickered with uncertainty. Softening his voice,he asked, "Can I come in?"

Without a word, she stepped aside, and Josh slipped inside with quick, almost furtive movements, shutting the door behind him.

"Uncle Josh." Gabriela mustered a polite smile. "Why are you still up?"

"Sleep just wouldn't come to me." He stepped inside, his gaze drifting over the room's plain, almost stark interior.

A bed, a desk, and little else-none of the cozy trinkets or splashes of color one might expect in a young woman's space.

The sight made his chest tighten, a wave of guilt and tenderness washing over him. He lingered for a moment before speaking, his voice edged with hesitation. "About what you said to Phyllis earlier..."

Gabriela answered evenly, "It was the truth."

Josh lowered his head slightly, regret darkening his eyes. "This is my fault." His chest tightened with guilt,the words tumbling out rough and uncertain."A∥Ithese years, Marie's been handling everything. Sometimes she'd even say good things about you. I assumed you and Phyllis were fine... I didn't realize you'd been putting up with so much. I'm sorry, Gabriela."

Gabriela let out a faint smile. "It's fine."

  The worst storms were long past. She'd made it to adulthood intact, and that alone felt like a gift that she had no intention of tarnishing with resentment.

"Gabriela..." Her calm expression only deepened the ache in him. On impulse, Josh fished a thick fold of bills from his pocket and pressed it into her palm. "Here. Use this for yourself."

"That won't be necessary." Gabriela quickly pushed the money back into his hand. She knew too well how tightly Marie gripped the household finances-this surely was scraped together in secret. Her voice softened, steady with quiet pride. "I've got a job now. I can take care of myself."

"You've only just started working-how much could you possibly earn?" Josh sighed, sliding the money toward her again."A-young woman should treat herself-buy some decent clothes, maybe a bit of makeup.Just take it."

Gabriela could feel the sincerity behind his gesture. With a helpless smile, she accepted the money, warmth flickering in her chest. "I appreciate it, Uncle Josh."

Her earlier spat with Phyllis replayed in her mind, and she was grateful it hadn't upset him enough to strain his heart.

Josh's gaze softened. "I didn't even notice-you've grown so much." He reached out, ruffling her hair with a fond, almost paternal touch, a quiet smile lifting his face. "When I first moved into this house, I promised your mother that when the time came, I'd put the deed in your name. Looks like that day's finally here."

Gabriela froze, blindsided by the revelation. Tears welled in her eyes, her throat tightening. "Uncle Josh, I...i don't even know what to say..."

"Phyllis can be a handful sometimes-always ready to throw a tantrum," Josh said with a weary sigh. "But at the end of the day, she's still your cousin. Try to be more forgiving. When life turns rough, you two might have no one else to lean on but each other."

Gabriela could hardly picture herself ever relying on Phyllis for anything, but she didn't want to crush Josh's hopeful tone. She let out a quiet hum of agreement.

Relieved by her softened expression, Josh's shoulders eased, though a shadow of worry lingered in his eyes. "By the way," he added, his voice hesitant. "Is it true you've been seeing... an older man?" The brief warmth Gabriela had felt vanished in a flash. course not! That's just one of Phyllis's ridiculous lies."

Nevertheless, Josh remained somewhat skeptical

He figured Gabriela was unwilling to admit the truth. After all, why else would Phyllis sound so convincing?

In his mind, Gabriela's behavior was the result of his own past negligence, the lapse that had allowed her to go astray.

His voice grew hoarse with emotion as he asked, "Can you please end things with that man?"

A prickle of unease ran through Gabriela at the tremor in Josh's tone.

Just as expected, a heartbeat later, he clasped her hands and broke down. Nearly fifty years old, yet unable to stop the tears spilling down his weathered face, he choked out,"|failed your mother. She asked me over and over to watch over you, and I..." His shoulders shook, the grief raw in his voice. "I betrayed her trust...I'm so ashamed."

Gabriela's gaze lingered on the streaks of silver in Josh's hair, and she exhaled in weary resignation. "I do have a boyfriend," she said softly, forcing a wry smile. "But he's young and handsome, not some older man.Honestly, I'm telling the truth."

Josh only tightened his grip on her hands, tears streaming down his weathered cheeks as though her words barely reached him. He wept for what felt like an eternity, and it wasn't until Gabriela swore-again and again -that she would introduce him to her boyfriend at Phyllis's wedding that his sobs finally subsided.

By the time she'd calmed him, Gabriela felt more drained than after an eight-hour workday. She all but collapsed onto her bed, sinking into the mattress, and was asleep before she could even pull up the blanket.

Her sleep was deep and untroubled. But elsewhere, rest was impossible.

Rhys lay in bed with his fractured wrist strapped into a splint, every throb a hot spike of pain that kept him wide awake. By dawn, the mirror offered no mercy-his reflection stared back at him, pale, disheveled, and worn down to the bone.
His eyes burned with venom as he wished he could storm over to Gabriela's house and beat her up.

When Haley Fox, Rhys's mother, heard about his injury, she got up at dawn and went to the hospital to take care of him. She set out breakfast on the table. As she urged him to eat more, she launched into a tirade about Gabriela.

"How could a girl like her have enough influence to make someone break your hand? Well, she's probably sleeping with her boss. Girls nowadays have no shame at all."

Her voice sharpened with every word, the flush in her cheeks deepening until she slammed her palm on the table. By the time she'd finished, she had worked herself into a full-blown fury, vowing to march straight into Gabriela's company and confront her face-to-face.

Until she did, the bitterness in her chest wouldn't ease.

Billy's warning echoed in Rhys's mind, sending an icy shiver down his spine. He forced a tense smile and muttered, "Mom, don't do anything stupid. I've got it handled."

Gabriela's boss might be young, but the man radiated danger-someone Rhys had no intention of crossing again.

For now, he'd have to bide his time, watch, and wait. The next time he caught Gabriela alone, he'd ensure she got laid-and capture the moment in photos to use as leverage against her.

That way, she'd be utterly at his mercy-with no way out.
###Chapter 41 Making Breakfast For Him


As Rhys sat brooding in his hospital bed, plotting his next move against Gabriela, she moved about the kitchen, quietly preparing breakfast.

Knowing Wesley had grown accustomed to fine dining, she opted for something modest yet thoughtful-assembling a crisp sandwich and tucking a neatly wrapped box of muffins into a bag.

Phyllis, passing by, caught sight of Gabriela busy in the kitchen in the soft morning light, with their chef stationed nearby, occasionally offering a word of praise for her cooking.

In the living room, Josh lounged with a newspaper in hand, the faint curve of approval on his face.

The memory of yesterday-Josh openly siding with Gabriela and even striking her-gnawed at Phyllis,stoking both envy and bitterness.

She stepped just outside the kitchen doorway, careful to keep her voice out of Josh's earshot, and drawled with a smirk, "Some people are just dramatic-cooking for themselves when they could have it done for them.Youactually think cooking for us will earn you brownie points?"

Gabriela glanced over her shoulder, a faint, mocking smile tugging at her lips. "Does it still hurt?" she asked,her tone laced with deliberate sweetness.

Phylis's expression froze, her jaw tightening.

Of course it still hurt-how could it not?

After losing a fistful of hair, her scalp still throbbed and stung, the skin raw where it had bled. The ache had kept her awake all night.

She hadn't even gone looking for påyback-yet Gabriela had the nerve to bring it up?

Phyllis's face warped with pure hatred, but Gabriela only curved her lips into a cool, taunting smile. "Keep running that filthy mouth, and I'll gladly rip out another handful for my collection." The memory of Gabriela's unflinching ferocity in past fights made Phyllis's bravado crumble. She automatically shuffled backward until she judged the distance safe, then hurled a weak insult from afar."You bitch!"

Gabriela didn't so much as blink. As long as Phyllis kept her distance, petty name-calling barely registered.She grabbed her packed breakfast, bid Josh a brisk farewell, and headed out.

The moment she stepped into the company's plaza, a figure suddenly darted toward her.

"Gabriela!" Aubrey hurriedly called out.

She skidded to a stop, grabbing Gabriela by the arms and giving her an almost comically thorough once-over, as if checking for any injuries. "I'm so sorry! I ducked out of work early yesterday and had no clue someone was giving you trouble," she gushed, shaking her head.e you sure you're okay? I heard Rhys went after you-did he hurt you?"

"I'm fine," Gabriela assured her, her tone calm. "I haven't got so much as a bruise. Really, there's no need to worry."

Aubrey let out a long breath, her shoulders easing. "Good. I also heard Mr. Moss swooped in to help you yesterday.He even drove you home afterward."

She then leaned in with a teasing glint in her eyes. "Did any sparks happen to fly between you two?"

Gabriela shot her a weary, unamused glance.

Now she realized Aubrey's concern was just an excuse to dig for more gossip about her and Wesley.

"Don't give me that look," Aubrey chided, undeterred. She tilted her head, a knowing smile playing on her lips. "You know how Mr. Moss is-cold as ice with thestaff. So why would he step in for you unless..." Her grin widened as she went on, "He's into you."

Gabriela opened her mouth to deny it, but the memory of Wesley's cool, unreadable expression gave her pause. It was true-he rarely involved himself with others, yet he had stepped in for her, then given her a ride home. That uncharacteristic kindness left her strangely unsettled.

"Wow, that dreamy look gives you away completely." Aubrey popped up in front of Gabriela with a mischievous grin. "All right, out with it-are you and Mr. Moss secretly dating?"

"Absolutely not!" Gabriela countered without missing a beat. "Keep gossiping about him in here, and you'll.be packing your things by day's end."

"I'm not gossiping about him," Aubrey remarked, feigning wounded innocence. "I'm gossiping about my best friend. Word is, Mr. Moss swooped in last night like some gallant knight-it was legendary! So, tell me,did he win your heart or not?"

Gabriela, unable to endure another round of her friend's relentless prying, turned on her heel. "I'm going to be late. I need to go."

Aubrey, undeterred, trailed after her.

Once they stepped into the company lobby, Aubrey toned herself down, not daring to breathe Wesley's name again. But the moment she spotted an empty hallway, she leaned closer and lowered her voice. "I've got news for you. You've been keeping tabs on Mr. Saunders, right? They're saying he might be coming back soon."

A spark of delight lit Gabriela's eyes as she replied, "For real?"

Ever since Brenden had tattled to Wesley with their WhatsApp chat screenshots, she'd barely spoken to him online.

Just last night, Josh had spent hours weeping into her ear until she finally promised she'd bring a boyfriend home for him. In a moment of weakness, she'd messaged Brenden to ask when he was coming back, yet the chat remained unanswered.

She had resigned herself to the idea that he wouldn't be coming back this year.

Yet here was a flicker of possibility. Could Wesley have decided to let him off the hook?

She leaned forward, quick to press. "Who told you that? Any idea exactly when Mr. Saunders will be back?" Aubrey tilted her head with a smug little grin. "Oh, now you're suddenly all chatty with me? I'll trade you that news for a few juicy details about you and Mr. Moss."

Gabriela let out a dry laugh, rolling her eyes. "Mr. Moss is my boss. My heart practically sops whenever he's in the same room. Is that enough for you?"

Aubrey responded with a smirk, "Mm-hmm. That's not enough."

Gabriela pressed on, her voice edged with impatience. "Just answer me-are you certain Mr. Saunders is really coming back?"

"Aren't you working right in the executive office? Why not go straight to the source and ask someone who actually knows?" Aubrey prodded.

They carried on, laughing andtrading remarks, unaware that just around the corner, Wesley stood in the shadows, his gaze icy and his very presence radiating a sharp,frigid weight.

Next to him, Billy froze, throat tightening, too afraid to even swallow.

Since when had Gabriela grown so familiar with Brenden? And why did she seem to care so much about his return? Was she like all those other women, drawn in by Brenden's easy charm and striking looks, harboring a secret crush?

The more the thought gnawed at him, the tighter unease coiled in Billy's gut. One glance at Wesley's stormy expression, and he prayed-desperately-that his suspicions were wrong.

When Gabriela stepped into the office, she halted mid-stride, startled to see Wesley already there.

She instinctively straightened her posture, forcing her voice into a polite calm. "Good morning,Mr.Moss."

He was i the middle of slipping off his suit jacket. At her voice, his head tilted, eyes narrowing in a cool,detached glance that felt as sharp as ice.

She moved forward at once, taking the jacket from him.

Up close, his height felt even more imposing, his tall frame radiating a quiet authority that was impossible to ignore. That single, downward flick of his gaze carried a chill sharp enough to make her spine prickle. Gabriela's legs felt unsteady, as though the strength had been drained from them.

She secretly wondered who'd crossed him this early in the morning-before the workday had even begun.

Pushing a smile onto her lips, she inquired, "Have you had breakfast yet, Mr. Moss?"

Wesley gave no reply, his expression carved from stone as he settled into the black swivel chair.

Still clutching his jacket, Gabriela lingered in place, unsure whether to stepo forward or retreat.

With his current demeanor, would it even be wise to offer the breakfast she'd prepared? He'd turned it down before without a second glance, and now, with his mood this foul, he might very well toss it into the trash without so much as lifting the lid.

From the corner of his eye, Wesley noticed her standing there, head bowed like a reprimanded schoolgirl.Instead of softening, his annoyance sharpened.

She'd sworn she would repay him, yet all she seemed intent on was sniffing around for news about Brenden.

Gabriela studied his expression, searching for the smallest crack in that wall of cool detachment. "Mr.Moss," she ventured softly. "Would you like some coffee this morning?"

Wesley's jaw tightened. Was this just another ploy, a convenient excuse for her to leave his office and dig for more news about Brenden?

The thought alone made his frustration boil over.

Noticing his expression grow colder, Gabriela drew in a slow, steady breath before pulling two elegantly wrapped boxes from her bag.

"I made this for you this morning. Would you like to try it?" she asked, her voice careful yet hopeful.

Even if he dumped it without a second thought, at least he'd know she had risen before dawn to prepare it for him.

Surely, that effort was worth some acknowledgment.

Wesley's gaze dropped to the boxes at last. "You made this?" "I did," Gabriela answered at once, catching the faint shift in his demeanor. "I got up early to make it. Didn't you mention you prefer lighter meals? The egg in this sandwich is fresh off the pan-soft, not greasy-so you won't have to worry."

Her eyes shone with quiet anticipation, hoping for a word of praise, and to her relief, the heaviness in Wesley's mood seemed to ease, if only slightly.
###Chapter 42 Rhys Was Arrested
Wesley took a sandwich from Gabriela. Its mouthwatering aroma instantly softened his expression.
"Have you eaten?" he asked, his gaze lingering on her.
Gabriela hesitated-first shaking her head, then giving a small nod.
She had prepared enough for both of them, secretly hoping they could share breakfast at the office. But the storm cloud he'd carried in this morning had kept her from daring to suggest it.
"Sit," Wesley said in a low, even voice, motioning to the chair opposite hím. "Eat with me."
Gabriela faltered, her eyes flicking to Wesley's face, searching for a hint of sincerity.
Wesley arched a brow. "Did you poison it or something?"
Her mouth opened, then closed again.
Was that seriously his first thought? She'd gotten up before dawn to make him breakfast, pouring care into every detail, and instead of a simple thank-you, he accused her of poisoning his food.
Her wounded look surely had struck a chord, because Wesley suddenly recalled the chubby orange tabby cat Tessa had brought to the office-a greedy little thing with a stomachache from being overfed, yet always prowling for its next bite.
Tessa had smuggled the cat into the office, intending to sneak it to the vet at lunch for some digestive medicine. But the cat hadn't been the least bit intimidated by the unfamiliar surroundings-it had waddled straight into Wesley's office, brazenly raidinghis snacks, only to be caught in the act by Billy.
Afterward, Tessa had given it an earful, threatening to put it on a three-meal fast.
In the end, the cat had endured hunger, a scolding, and even a jab from the vet, leaving it sulking in a corner, shivering with wounded pride.
Wesley thought of that disgruntled, chubby cat, then glanced at Gabriela's forlorn expression. The resemblance was so uncanny, it almost made him laugh.

Noticing the odd look on his face, Gabriela tilted her head slightly. "Mr. Moss, aren't you going to eat? Is it not to your liking?"

Wesley's lips curved faintly. "No, I just remembered a chubby little cat."

Gabriela blinked,caught between confusion and offense.

Of all things, he thought of a cat while looking at her-and did he really have to stress the word chubby?

Her silent glare only seemed to amuse him more, and whatever shadow had been clouding his mood vanished entirely.

"Come on, sit. Have breakfast with me. That cat never got this kind of treatment," he said with a hint of teasing.

He recalled how the cat had once tried to sneak into his office for snacks, only to be unceremoniously chased out.

Gabriela finally gave a nod. Right now, nothing in the world mattered more than getting some food in her stomach.

She took a seat and joined Wesley for breakfast.

When she bit into the last muffin, Billy stepped in, ushering the finance director along. Wesley had reminded her not to leave even a crumb to waste.

Billy barely batted an eye at the sight, smoothly reciting the day's schedule as though finding Gabriela at Wesley's desk was perfectly routine.

The finance director, however, faltered mid-step, his expression betraying his surprise. His gaze flicked between them while he read off the figures, stealing quick glances at Gabriela as though trying to decipher what he was seeing.

When she was done, Gabriela quietly gathered the empty boxes. She disappeared into the kitchen, the faint sound of running water following her.

The finance director's thoughts drifted to the whispers he'd heard lately-rumors he'd half dismissed. But now, witnessing this scene firsthand, he couldn't help thinking there might be more truth to them than he'd believed.

Gabriela, despite being just an intern, truly seemed to hold a special place in Wesley's good graces.

Even though Gabriela had managed to lift Wesley's mood, she still didn't dare bring up Brenden's name.

Meanwhile, Rhys-his hand still wrapped in thick bandages-had been resting at home for several days.

One afternoon, however, his boss personally called, instructing him to return to the office.

When Rhys's mother, Haley, heard the news, she frowned in indignation. "Your boss really has no heart.You're injured this badly, and he still drags you back to work?"

Rhys,however, looked rather smug. "I'm the director of the planning department. Some matters can only be handled by me," he said with quiet pride.

Convinced the company would fall apart without him, he strode back into work with a spring in his step. The moment the boss's secretary spotted him, she wasted no time ushering Rhys straight toward the office.

It wasn't until he stepped inside that an uneasy prickle ran down his spine.

His boss sat behind the desk-but he wasn't alone. Beside him stood Nicholas Hart, the supplier who'd provided materials for the Eastmeuse Industrial Park project Rhys had managed over a year ago, and Konner Price, the project's chief engineer.

Neither man met Rhys's gaze; both looked tense, their eyes darting anywhere but at him.

The Eastmeuse Industrial Park project had wrapped up three months ago, and all payments had been cleared. So why had the boss suddenly summoned them?

Rhys greeted his boss with a respectful nod, ready to ask why Nicholas and Konner were present.

Before he could speak, the boss's gaze hardened. "Rhnys, there's a serious issue with the Eastmeuse Industrial Park. Two-thirds of the materials don't meet quality standards. You'd better have a damn good explanation."

The boss's voice cracked like a whip, and Rhys felt his knees weaken. A bead of cold sweat slid down his temple.

He knew exactly why this was happening-he'd used his position to conspire with Konner, approving Nicholas's substandard supplies in exchange for hefty kickbacks. He'd assumed the defects would take years to surface, giving him plenty of time to shift the blame and walk away unscathed.

Rhys had not expected that just a few short months after the project wrapped up, the boss would uncover such a bombshell.

"Sir, I can explain..." Rhys began, his voice tight.

The boss's eyes were like steel. "Save it for the police."
In massive projects like this, cutting corners wasn't exactly unheard of; most executives pretended not to notice so long as the flaws weren't catastrophic.

But this time, the evidence against Rhys wasironclad-records of the kickbacks sat right on the boss's desk. It was worse than anyone had guessed. Furious, he ordered his secretary to call the police.
Minutes later, uniformed police officers strode in, their presence heavy and unyielding. Without a word,they escorted Rhys and the other two men out, the sharp click of handcuffs echoing through the office.
When Haley got wind of the news, a chill of dread shot through her. Without wasting a second, she grabbed her phone and called her husband, Draven Fox. "Rhys has given that company years of his life. So what if he took a little kickback? How could his boss go straight to the police over something so small? You'd better figure out a way to get him out of this."
Though Draven was just a universitý professor, he had deep ties and a long list of influential acquaintances.

Haley, convinced it was nothing serious, felt certain that with her husband stepping in, the problem would vanish. At first, Draven shared her confidence.

Within the school, his word carried weight that few dared to challenge, and he moved through its halls with the arrogance of a man who believed himself untouchable. Even the pretty students he set his sights on knew better than to defy him.

But the illusion of control shattered in an instant-he had barely ended a phone call when a pair of uniformed police officers stepped forward, snapping cold steel around his wrists. Without ceremony,they marched him out and hauled him to the station, where he found himself locked up beside his son.

The fallout was swift. The school released an official notice stripping Draven of every position he held,then pinned a blunt, damning statement to the bulletin board: his misconduct was beyond forgiveness,and he would never again be employed there.

The very students he had preyed upon whispered in the corridors, some unable to hide their satisfaction.

The scandal spread quickly, spilling beyond campus walls until it made the evening news, each headline sealing the fate of the once untouchable professor.

Gabriela didn't learn the news until she stepped through the door after work and saw Josh glued to the television. The evening report had just cut to footage of Draven being led away in handcuffs, the school's expulsion notice flashing across the screen.

"This professor looks familiar," Josh said, narrowing his eyes at the image. "Oh! Isn't he Rhys's father?"

At his question, Phyllis's voice shook as she replied, "I think you are mistaken."

"No, that man is definitely Rhys's father," Gabriela said, her tone icy after hanging up from a string of calls."He's been preying on students for years, and now every filthy thing he's done has finally come to light. By the way, Rhys's shoddy project work had nearly cost lives, and now he was sitting in a jail cell. Looks like they finally got what was coming to them."

Phyllis's stomach dropped. She shot Gabriela a venomous glare, her tone frosty. "Rhys used to be your friend. How can you talk like that?"

"Friend? Don't make me laugh. He attempted to kidnap me in public!" Gabriela replied, her words cutting clean. "I've always stayed on the right side of the law. I'd never get involved with a criminal like him. And you, be careful. Stay too close to Rhys, and you might just find yourself dragged down with him."
###Chapter43 This Was Absolutely His Doing


Phyllis had always carried herself from a lofty perch, a figure Gabriela would once have obeyed without question.

But now, Gabriela met each of her words with sharp, unflinching comebacks-every barb returned with tenfold bite-leaving Phyllis's temper close to boiling.

There was an audacity in Gabriela now, a wild defiance that went beyond mere talk. She had not only dared to seize Phyllis by the hair but had stared her down with mocking eyes, her tone dripping with challenge.

When had Gabriela gotten the guts to stand her ground? Where had she found the nerve to snap back like this?

A rush of bitter questions churned through Phyllis's mind, though she forced her features into a mask of refinement for Josh's sake, tilting her head as if wounded.

"I had no idea Rhys was that sort of man," she murmured, her voice trembling with practiced hurt."You've always drawn trouble to yourself-so why point the finger at me?"

The insinuation was clear: Gabriela's life seemed destined to invite chaos, and Phyllis was merely caught in its wake.

With an icy tone, Gabriela shot back, "If it weren't for you, I never would've crossed paths with a lowlife like Rhys."

Phyllis froze, her face twisting as if the words had struck a raw nerve.

She swallowed her temper with visible effort, then put on a pitiful pout and turned toward Josh. "Dad, you saw how she spoke to me. I only introduced Rhys because | thought he was a decent man. I was trying to help her, but it all blew up in my face."

Josh's brows drew together. "Enough. From now on, stop playing matchmaker for Gabriela," he said firmly."And work on your judgment before you go recommending anyone to her again." Privately, Josh felt a measure of relief-at least Gabriela hadn't gotten too entangled with Rhys. Otherwise,his collapse would've taken her down too.
Phyllis, however, was quite frustrated.
With her mother buried in work until midnight most days, she had no one to join her in taking digs at Gabriela.
Even venting her irritation had become impossible.
And now, seeing the disaster Rhys's family had brought upon themselves, she could only grit her teeth. It was a sobering reminder to think twice before crossing Gabriela again.
Gabriela slipped back into her room without a hitch, a quiet thrill curling through her at the memory of Rhys finally getting what he deserved.
But then a thought snagged in her mind-yesterday, Wesley had stepped in for her, and today, Rhys's downfall came like a hammer blow.
For a brief, startling moment, she wondered if Wesley had orchestrated it all. With the kind of influence he wielded, wiping Rhys out would have been child's play.
Then she gave a short laugh at herself and brushed the notion away.
She was just a lowly secretary-why on earth would a man like him move mountains to settle her grudges?-Clearly, his recent flashes of kindness were making her entertain foolish ideas.
Gabriela tapped her cheek ljghtly, as if scolding herself back to sense.
The following morning, the moment she stepped into the office, Aubrey caught her by the arm and leaned in, her voice pitched low. "Have you seen the news? Rhys and his father got arrested."
Gabriela gave a small nod. "Mm-hm. I saw it last night."
"Mr. Moss is truly impressive!" Aubrey's eyes gleamed with mischief and excitement."Come on, Gabriela,what magic trick did you pull to make him value you this much? He's personally making sure Rhys is stuck in that police station. That bastard couldn't lay a finger on you again."

"Come on!" Gabriela cut her off in a rush, heat rising to her cheeks. "Who says this has anything to do with Mr.Moss?"

"Oh, please." Aubrey tilted her head, a sly smile tugging at her lips. "Rhys caused you trouble yesterday, and today he's damn well paying for it. Anyone with eyes can tell Mr. Moss had a hand in it."

"Or maybe Rhys finally got what was coming to him for his vile acts!" Gabriela shot back.

Aubrey rolled her eyes. "Does Mr. Moss know how stubbornly ungrateful you are? I'm telling you, this was absolutely his doing. You'd better start figuring out how you're going to thank him."

Even after parting ways with Aubrey, Gabriela's heart continued its frantic rhythm, stubbornly ignoring her efforts to steady it.

So it wasn't just her imagination-anyone in her shoes would have drawn the same conclusion.

Still... was Wesley really the one pulling the strings?

Later, as she prepared his coffee, she found herself lingering near his desk, stealing quick, uncertain glances at him from the corner of her eye.

Noticing her restless presence, Wesley's brow furrowed and asked, "Rough night? You look worn out."

"I was up way too late studying the materials you gave me," Gabriela answered lightly.

"Don't push yourself too hard. You need sleep," he remarked, his tone carrying a quiet note of concern.

When Gabriela had first stepped into the executive office, he'd teased her with a challenge-memorize an entire stack of documents in just one day. Yet he'd never once quizzed her on the material.

"Got it," Gabriela replied, though her fingers tightened around the folder in her hands. She wanted to ask about Rhys, but Wesley's cool, unréadable gaze kept the question locked in her throat.

By the time noon rolled around, she had already decided she'd cook a spread worthy of a five-star chef,hoping to win his approval-and maybe slip in a few casual questions while his guard was down. But before she could set her plan in motion, Wesley glanced up and said flatly,"We'll eat out today."

Gabriela instantly began gathering his daily essentials-charger, cables, markers, stapler, two changes of clothes, even a pack of gum-moving with brisk efficiency.

Whenever Wesley had an outside engagement, the preparation felt less like office work and more like stocking an expedition.

Gabriela couldn't help feeling more like a live-in housekeeper than an office secretary, grumbling under her breath that he might as well skip hiring a secretary altogether and just find himself a wife and put her on the payroll.

She zipped the bag shut and turned-only to stop short. Wesley was right behind her, his tall frame casting a shadow over her, the quiet authority in his stance making the air between them hum.

Gabriela stiffened, a silent prayer flashing through her mind that he hadn't caught a single word of her muttered complaint.

Fate, however, wasn't feeling generous.

"All set?" Wesley's voice carried a lazy edge, before his mouth curved in faint amusement. "Instead of complaining, why not recruit me a spouse to do your work?"

The heat rushed from her face to her knees, leaving them perilously weak. She had whispered so softly-how could he have heard every word?

But Wesley didn't linger to savor her embarrassment. He simply strode out, his long frame exuding an air of satisfaction, as if her flustered reaction had set his mood alight.

Still unsettled, Gabriela hurried after him to the parking lot, where the sight of Billy behind the wheel caught her off guard.

"You're coming with us today, Billy?" she asked, brows lifting.

Billy's easy smile reached his eyes as he extended a hand toward her. "That's right. Let me take that."

Gabriela figured she had probably crossed a line earlier, and Wesley had simply decided to leave her behind. She was about to pass the backpack over when Wesley's expression turned abruptly severe, the sharp crease in his brow making her freeze.

Startled, she clutched the backpack tighter to her chest, her fingers tightening around the straps. "I'll carry it. Really-it's no trouble. I'm strong," she blurted, her voice soft but urgent.

Her gaze flicked up to Wesley, searching for any sign of approval, silently pleading to prove she was more than capable-and that her earlier teasing hadn't jeopardized her position.

Wesley's eyes stayed cool, his face unreadable, yet he didn't dismiss her.

Seizing the small mercy, Gabriela quickly stepped forward to open the car door for him before slipping in quietly at his side.

Billy, catching the crackle of tension in the air, kept his eyes on the road and his mouth shut, embodying the perfect,tight-lipped driver.

Their ride ended at the Grace Robuchon-an exclusive, members-only sanctuary that welcomed only cardholders and the rare few personally invited by the restaurant itself.

The barrier to entry was sky-high, but for the elite, membership was more than a dining privilege; it was a gleaming badge of status. Its opulence outshone even the famed Gilded Fork, drawing in society's most influential players.

For a man like Wesley, the place would gladly extend complimentary membership, fully aware that his presence alone could lure a wave of eager, deep-pocketed applicants-heirs to fortunes, industry tycoons,even A-list celebrities-each willing to part with millions in annual fees for the bragging rights.

In Okburg, a Grace Robuchon card wasn't just a key to fine dining; it was proof of being among the city's most influential.

Gabriela, who had spent over two decades in the city without once holding one, was now stepping inside for the very first time.

From the instant they crossed the threshold, the doorman greeted them with a practiced, welcoming smile,personally guiding them inside. Soon, Gabriela was seated in a private dining room reserved just for them, where a striking young waiter laid out appetizers and poured crystalline beverages, the soft strains of a live piano drifting in from the next room.

Shifting the bag higher on her shoulders, Gabriela felt its weight drag her firmly back to reality.

She kept in mind she was just Wesley's tagalong and dared not get ahead of herself.

Yet the instant her gaze landed on Mason, her resolve faltered, and her thoughts veered straight to the one-billion-dollar deal.

This was her third encounter with him.
###Chapter 44 Her Confident Gleam


Mason walked over to Wesley, offering him an apology for being late."|got caught up at Century Square-some company was holding an event, and the crowd was so packed it blocked the road. That's why I'm late."

Wesley waved it off, but Mason still felt the need to repeat his apologies.

Turning to Gabriela, Mason greeted her warmly.pleasure to see you again, Miss Haynes."

"Please, just call me Gabriela," she replied quickly.

"All right, then." Mason nodded.

Despite his age and statusas a major client, he carried himself without airs, speaking easily with Wesley.

Wesley, however, kept a polite smile paired with an icy demeanor, just enough to hint at aloofness.

Gabriela worried his cool manner might offend someone as important as Mason and risk losing a multi-million-dollar deal.

With practiced ease, she steered the conversation, drawing smiles from Mason.

They'd met twice before, once at a banquet where Mason had been busy with other guests, and once on the golf course, where Gabriela had been attending to Wesley. Neither occasion had allowed much conversation.

Now, seated across the table, Mason discovered her sharp eloquence and refined taste.

As they talked, he learned she was skilled at building architectural models-detailed creations involving design, structure, and every element from foundation to finish-each infused with her own ideas.

Mason, a devoted enthusiast of handcrafted architecture, lit up at the discovery.

Gabriela described her college project-a model of an undersea city, roughly 4 feet long and 2 feet wide. The whole city was submerged in miniature, evoking a distant, ancient world.

"It took me about a hundred days to finish," she said.

Afterward, a gaming company had approached her to buy it as a game backdrop.

"I'd love to see it," Mason said with interest.

Gabriela hesitated. "I'm not even sure where it is anymore."

She guessed the model might be buried somewhere in her room, gathering dust.

"I don't have any pictures saved on my phone-otherwise, I'd show you the finished product," she sighed.

"That's a pity," Mason said with regret.

Something stirred in Wesley's mind as he glanced at her.

When she spoke of the undersea city, her voice carried a quiet pride, and her eyes shone with unguarded triumph.

It was the kind of confidence that naturally drew attention.

Billy, too, was surprised.

He'd always known Gabriela to be diligent and well-educated, but he'd never seen this spark before.

Now, he better understood why Wesley was interested in her.

Mason seemed equally taken with her and hoped she might build another one someday.

"When I have time, I will," Gabriela said. "And I'd be glad to have your thoughts on it."

Mason laughed. "I'd love to see it."

Though she spoke modestly, her eyes still carried that confident gleam, enough to curl Wesley's lips into a faint smile.

"I'm looking forward to it too," he said. The meal went on, and Gabriela and Mason found themselves in easy rapport, regretting they hadn't met sooner.

She even toasted him several times, despite Wesley's attempts to stop her.

Still, every time she steered the conversation toward the deal, Wesley subtly deflected.

Gabriela found it puzzling, but after several tries, she sensed Wesley's lack of enthusiasm for the deal and chose not to push it any further.

After some drinks, Gabriela excused herself to use the restroom.

The hallway to the restroom was long.

On her way back, she passed an open private room and spotted Phyllis inside.

Phyllis looked effortlessly chic in her light gold coat and matching beret-every inch the fashion icon.

She was with Dustin and a few female friends, all busy complimenting her.

"Phyllis, you're absolutely radiant today. I mean different. That outfit's stunning-and I've never seen you wear this hat before. Where'd you get it? It's gorgeous."

Phyllis accepted the praise, offering to take them shopping sometime.

Dustin sat beside her, attentively serving her food.

Gabriela knew the hat was hiding Phyllis's bald patches, which she found amusing.

Still, a conversation with Phyllis was the last thing she wanted. Her pace instinctively increased.

But a woman with red hair spotted her and stepped into her path. "Gabriela? What are you doing here?"

Gabriela ignored her and kept walking until another woman joined in, pulling her into the room.

One of them sneered, "Don't rush off! Tell us, are you working part-time here?"

"I'm here dining with my boss," Gabriela said coldly. Those women laughed, their eyes sharp with mockery.

A woman smirked. "Since when can you splurge on meals like this? Dining with the boss? Really? Where is he-introduce us!"

The Grace Robuchon required membership, and they clearly didn't believe her.

The red-haired woman scoffed. "Stop pretending. We all know you're poor. What else would you be doing here except working part-time? Even if you were serving or washing dishes, we wouldn't mock you, but acting high and mighty makes you look ridiculous."

In an instant, all eyes turned to Gabriela.

Phyllis watched in silence, enjoying the scene.

Once the others had taken their shots, she leaned in with a soft, patronizing tone. "Don't you already have a job, Gabriela? Why are you still working part-time at a restaurant? Is money tight again?"

Her gaze flicked to Gabriela's designer clothes, jealousy flashing in her eyes.

She said in feigned concern, "I know girls love designer things, but working part-time just to afford them isn't worth it. My dad promised your mom he'd look after you, yet here you are, degrading yourself for the sake of vanity. If he knew, he'd be heartbroken."

Dustin's expression soured, and he subtly shifted away, as though being near Gabriela were somehow embarrassing.

Phyllis sighed. "If you're really that short on money, I can lend you some."
###Chapter 45 Accused Of Theft
Phyllis dug into her bag, pulled out her wallet, and peeled off a few bills. "It was wrong of me to introduce you to Rhys, Gabriela. Take this as my apology."
Rhys's name had been splashed across the headlines, and because Phyllis and her friends had attended the same university as him, his scandal spread quickly among their circle.
"When did you get mixed up with Rhys, Phyllis?" one of Phyllis's friends asked.
Putting on a regretful sigh, Phyllis said, "Gabriela and I only knew he was pulling in over a million a year. She was so eager to meet him, so I set them up. Yet I didn't take the time to check what kind of man he really was...I mneant well, but I made a mistake."
The explanation landed like a stone in a pond. Her friends' eyes slid toward Gabriela, their expressions turning sharper, tinged with contempt.
Pursuing a man solely for his paycheck-without a thought for his character-was pure self-destruction in their eyes. Pathetic didn't even begin to cover it.
Gabriela's lips curled in a sharp, impatient sneer. "So desperate to smear my name that you're distorting the truth,Phyllis?"
Phyllis's face faltered, her voice taking on a wounded edge. "I know I'm to blame for introducing Rhys to you..."
Gabriela cut her off with a cold glint in her eyes. "You really want to keep up this performance? Don't come bawling to your dad when I let the rest of our schoolmates in on your little stunt."
The threat silenced Phyllis instantly.
Her friends, however, assumed she was being cornered and jumped to her aid. "Why waste your time on someone so selfish and nasty, Phyllis? And you're actually lending her money? Once it's in her hands, it's gone for good!" Phyllis bit her lip, eyes shimmering as though tears might spill. "But... she's my cousin."

"You still consider her family, but I doubt she feels the same." The red-haired woman, Vivian Vasquez,raked Gabriela with a slow, dismissive glance, her lips curling into a superior smile. "Gabriela, my family happens to need a maid. I've heard you can cook tolerably well. Why not come work part-time at my place after your shift here? I'll pay you the same hourly rate you get at this restaurant."

The others leaned in with mocking laughter. "So generous of you, V/ivian. But can you really trust someone like her in your home? What if she walks off with something valuable?"

"I'm only making the offer out of respect for PhyllisVivian said with a shrug. Her lips curled into a smirk."You should feel lucky, Gabriela. Not everyone has a cousin this generous."

Gabriela wasn't in the mood to play along with their performance. She turned on her heel and started walking away.

She'd barely gone a few steps before Vivian's voice rang out sharply behind her."Stay right where you are,Gabriela!"

Gabriela kept moving, lengthening her stride.

Vivian's irritation spiked, and she hurried after her, heels clicking hard against the floor. "Are you deaf? I told you to stop!"

Gabriela turned to meet her eyes, her tone icy."And what exactly do you want from me?"

Vivian's voice rose, sharp with accusation. "My necklace is gone.Did you take it?"

Gabriela instantly caught the calculated malice behind the words, her expression hardening to ice."|fyou can't back that up with proof, do us both a favor and keep quiet."

She turned to walk away, but Vivian's command cracked through the air. "Stop her! Don't let her slip off!"She signaled to her friends, her eyes glinting with ridicule. "You're not here earning wages, and you're not just here for a meal-so what is it? Here to steal?"

The others piled on with sneering glee. "Back in school, Gabriela, you were always stealing Phyllis's clothes, het jewelry, and even her hairpins. No wonder you've got your hands on Vivian's pretty necklace now."

Phyllis jumped in without missing a beat. "Don't say that. Gabriela was just young and a little foolish back then. And anyway, my dad asked me to take care ofher. Girls are drawn to pretty things. She was just borrowing them,not taking them for good."

Her tone was soft, but her eyes slid toward Gabriela wvith quiet reproach. "Gabriela, my dad genuinely cares about you. If you wanted a beautiful necklace, all you had to do was ask him-he'dgladly buy it for you.There's no need to take something that belongs to someone else."

Though she framed it as a defense, her verdict was already clear-Gabriela had stolen it.

They stood in the hallway just outside the private dining room, voices carrying.

The stir of their exchange had already drawn curious onlookers, with patrons drifting closer in'twos and threes to watch the drama unfold.

The patrons at Grace Robuchon were the sort who measured their worth in weaIth and influence, and this was the firsttime they had ever witnessed a supposed thief within its polished walls.

"She's easy on the eyes. Who'd have guessed she's a thief?"

"When did Grace Robuchon stoop to letting the thieves in?"

"Bet she used that pretty face to slip past the staff."

"Be careful-she's the type who wouldn't think twice about going after someone else's man."

Every stare that landed on Gabriela brimmed with judgment, a toxic mix of suspicion and scorn.

She could see they were stirring the pot on purpose, yet she felt no urge to waste her breath. With an icy glance, she sidestepped the crowd and moved to leave, her steps cutting through the thick air of malice.

Vivian's voice cracked like a whip. "Gabriela, you're not going anywhere. Hand over the necklace first."

Gabriela pivoted on her heel, her glare cutting through the air like a blade. "I didn't take your necklace.Pull up the security footage if you don't believe me." A sharp glint lit her eyes, enough to make Vivian's confidence waver for an instant.

"I never accused you of stealing," Vivian said smoothly, though her tone dripped with venom. "Maybe you stumbled across it and decided to keep it. After all, someone like you-who's clearly never owned anything finer than cheap trinkets-wouldn't know what to do with something of real value."

One of her lackeys snickered and added, "Why waste time with security footage for something so small?Just search her."

In their minds, it was only natural. A woman as destitute as Gabriela-rumored to have worked shady nightclub gigs during her school years-wouldn't think twice about pocketing a treasure she found.

They closed in on Gabriela, brazenly trying to search her as if she were a common thief.

The commotion drew an even bigger crowd, curious onlookers pressing closer.

Elegant gowns and expensive suits surrounded Gabriela, their owners wearing the same smug expression-certain she was a pathetic thief who refused to return the necklace, despite being caught in the act. Not a single one stepped forward to help. A few people even lifted their phones, grinning as they recorded the scene, no doubt eager to upload it later for their own amusement.

One woman clamped onto Gabriela's arm while another yanked at her coat, peeling it from her shoulders.Then their fingers scrabbled for the fabric beneath-her blouse now their target.

The crowd with their phones leaned in, hungry for a scandal, their eyes glittering at the thought she might be stripped completely.

A sudden rush of heat surged through Gabriela's veins, her pulse pounding in her ears.

Old humiliations from her school days-every whispered insult, every cruel shove-surged back like a tide,stoking a blistering fury in her chest.

With a sudden, explosive force, she tore free of their grip, driving the two women back before fisting a punishing handful of hair from each.

Her tone dropped to an icy blade. "I'll say this one last time-I haven't laid eyes on your necklace." The move was so fast it left the air charged.

Both women stiffened, breath hitching, their faces pale beneath Gabriela's unyielding glare.

A prickling sensation crawled over Phyllis's scalp. She eased backward, putting some distance between herself and Gabriela.

From the crowd, a voice rose, sharp and accusing. "If you're innocent, then what's the harm in letting us search you?"

Gabriela forced her fury down, her voice laced with biting sarcasm. "Well, I happen to have lost a rather pricey bracelet myself. I suspect one of you took it. How about you all line up and let me search you?"

The woman who had spoken earlier bristled, her cheeks flushing hot. "You claim you lost it-but did anyone actually see it?"

Gabriela's tone sharpened as she turned her attention on Vivian. "And who saw you lose your necklace?"

Vivian's gaze wavered, the sudden challenge making her shoulders stiffen. She looked away without answering.

Gabriela's finger swung toward Phyllis."Doyou know why she's wearing that hat? Because she pulled something dirty, tried to shove the blame on me, and almost had every strand on her head yanked out. Want me to give you the same treatment?"

The hallway sank into a tense, almost suffocating silence.

All eyes locked on Gabriela-the elegant beauty who had, in an instant, revealed a startlingly fierce side.

Her fingers tightened in the hair of the two women, her voice sharp as a blade. "Let's get this search over with. Coats off. Will you do it yourselves, or should I strip them for you?"

The women froze in her grasp, stunned, before breaking into shrill, theatrical screams."Are you insane?"

"Quiet!" Gabriela snarled, yanking their hair until their scalps prickled with pain. Terrified she might rip it out,they shook as they peeled off their coats. Her gaze shifted to Vivian-cold, unblinking, and merciless. "You started this," she said, her tone low and lethal. "So tell me...do you know what comes next?"

Vivian stood frozen, unable to believe what she was seeing.

In all her years of knowing Gabriela, she had never witnessed this side of her. Back in school, no matter how cruel the taunts or humiliating the pranks, Gabriela had always swallowed her pride and endured in silence.

But now? She was radiating defiance-grabbing hair, ordering people to strip off their coats for a search-bold enough to make the entire hallway hold its breath.

Grinding her teeth, Vivian snapped, "Even if no one saw you take my necklace, you're the only one who is poor here. Who else could it possibly be?"

"Oh? So you've been making this fuss on pure guesswork?" Gabriela's lips curved in a cold smile. "Is that how the Vasquez family settles matters-by guessing? Does your brother know you're like this?"

The mere mention of her brother made Vivian's bravado crumble. Fear flickered across her face, and she fell silent, not daring to utter another word.
###Chapter 46 She Had Someone To Lean On


"That's enough!" Dustin, who had been watching from the sidelines with a clenched jaw, suddenly barked,stepping forward as if ready to pry Gabriela away himself.

Before he could reach her, the restaurant manager came hurrying over, his voice cutting through the tension. "Surveillance footage is ready. Anyone who lost something, take a look."

Without waiting for anyone's opinion, he signaled the staff, and the footage lit up on the wall for all to see.

It made everything plain: from the moment Vivian walked in, she had never lost anything-and Gabriela had never picked up a thing.

A murmur rippled through the crowd. No one had expected the manager to check the surveillance footage on his own, much less play the evidence in front of everyone.

The crowd exchanged glances, their expressions shifting-curiosity giving way to something far more complicated as their gazes landed on Vivian.

"So,it had been a setup from the very start. It's really shameless of her to pull such a cheap trick."

"Isn't she part of the Vasquez family? We better warn our family to stay away-mixing with her will only tarnish our name."

The murmurs cut through the air like tiny blades, and Vivian's stomach twisted into a cold knot.

Gabriela hadn't expected the restaurant manager to step in without so much as a word from her.

When she turned, her gaze caught on Wesley-standing just beyond the crowd, tall and unyielding,his presence radiating quiet authority that drew every eye without effort. His striking featues were carved into a cold, unyielding scowl, chin lifted'with quiet defiance, a chill rolling off him like winter air.

Yet in that instant, she felt Wesley as an unshakable pillar at her back-solid, immovable, someone she could finally lean on without fear of collapsing. Billy shouldered his way through the murmuring crowd, his presence cutting through the tension.

The restaurant manager stepped forward at once, his tone almost deferential. "Does this resolution meet your approval, Mr. Clarke?"

Billy's gaze swept over to Vivian, cool and measured. "Get the police involved."

A ripple of dread shot through Vivian. "What? Who the hell are you? WNhat gives you the right to report me to the police?"

Billy ignored Vivian entirely and, with a gentle smile meant only for Gabriela, said, "Come on,let's go."

She trailed after him toward Wesley, tilting her face up to meet his gaze. "Thanks for that, Mr. Moss."

"Fool," he said flatly.

The word cut sharp, but before she could respond, he shrugged off his suit jacket and draped it over her shoulders."Wear it."

She'd gone and thrown herself into trouble without even thinking to call for help. If he hadn't grown uneasy about her being gone so long and sent Billy to find her, would she have tried to clean up that mess alone?

Still... the fire in her eyes told him she wouldn't have walked away defeated.

Mason's tone carried a firm edge. "Gabriela, when something like this happens, don't waste your breath arguing.Call Mr.Moss right away-he'll stand behind you."

Gabriela lowered her gaze, murmuring an obedient admission of fault before hastily slipping into Wesley's jacket.

The fabric was cold and rigid at first touch, yet beneath it lingered a faint, steady warmth from Wesley's body. That quiet heat wrapped around her like a shield, and for a fleeting moment, the sting in her chest made her want to cry. For the first time, she truly believed she had someone she could lean on.

Meanwhile, the restaurant manager had already called the police. Vivian was taken in for slander and sentenced to a three-day detention. It was a lenient sentence, especially considering she had gone so far as to have Gabriela's coat stripped off in public. But for a pampered young lady like her, the humiliation alone was punishment enough-a stain on her pride she would never wash away.

The police station refused to grant bail, insisting she spend the full three days in detention.

Vivian seethed, her voice rising with disbelief. "Phyllis, Gabriela's just an intern. How on earth could her boss be defending her like this?"

Phyllis faltered, lowering her voice as if sharing a secret. "Theother day, I went to her company to drop off the wedding invitation... and happened to see her accepting a gift from SK Elite Boutique."

One of their friends gasped, "SK Elite? That's insanely pricey! Their membership requirements make Grace Robuchon look cheap. How could she possibly afford it?"

Phyllis leaned closer, speaking in a hushed, knowing tone. "She might have a rich boyfriend-that would explain why her boss is so protective. A few nights lately, I've spotted her slipping into a luxury car. I've never seen the man, though. Almost like she's hiding who he is from me."

Vivian's jaw tightened, fury flashing in her eyes. "If she really has a secret boyfriend, he's probably somne wrinkled old man."

Phyllis lowered her voice. "Please don't say that."

Vivian couldn't care less if her words were too harsh; her only concern was getting out of police custodýbefore the situation spiraled.

If her brother caught wind of this, she was finished.

"I'll try talking to Gabriela," Phyllis offered smoothly. "Maybe we can settle this quietly."

That finally cooled Vivian's temper, if only a little. "I'm in your debt, Phyllis."

Without wasting another second, Phyllis and Dustin rushed back toward the restaurant-arriving just in time to see Gabriela about to slip into the waiting car.

Phyllis hurried over, stepping in front of her with a forced, anxious smile. "Gabriela, you and Vivian used to be classmates. This was just a misunderstanding-no need to blow it out of proportion, right? Can't you just let her off the hook?"

"How could you call this a misunderstanding?" Gabriela's expression stayed cold, her voice clipped. "She searched me in public and even tore off my coat. Besides, it was my boss's decision to involve the police-not mine to reverse."

"For my sake, can't we just let it go?" Phyllis pressed, her tone dripping with entitlement.
Even as she pleaded, she regarded Gabriela with cool detachment-chin tilted, confidence radiating as if the outcome were already in her hands.

Gabriela's lips curved in a thin, sardonic smile. "For your sake? Did you forget what you and your mother did to me? You took my mom's house as if it were your own. On that very first day you moved in, you went straight to mny closet and took all my clothes. And your mother latched onto my mother's company while refusing to cover my tuition!"

A flicker of icy malice darted through Phyllis's eyes as her fingers whitened around the handle of her designer bag. Still, her expression stayed composed, her tone deliberately calm. "I know you're still mourning your mother, but that doesn't give you the right to spew wild accusations and claim my family's property as your own."

Gabriela's gaze didn't waver. "Deny it all you like-my mother's name is still the one on the deed."

"Gabriela, try having some dignity!" Dustin's voice cracked like a whip, sharp and accusing. "Take a good look at yourself-acting petty and clinging on just because you've won this round! It was nothing but a small misunderstanding. You're clearly unharmed, yet you keep lashing out-snapping at everyone. Phyllis is letting your insult slide-be grateful."

Gabriela met his glare with an unshaken calm, her tone cold as glass. "For someone depending on a woman to get by, you'd better watch your tone."

Heat shot through Dustin's chest, his breath hitching with the urge to lash out.

He honestly couldn't fathom how Gabriela-who'd once treated him with mild politeness-had morphed into someone so razor-edged with her words. Could Phyllis be right? Did snagging a wealthy older man inflate Gabriela's ego this much?

Even so, he kept his mouth shut. He still needed Phyllis's help if he wanted to climb higher.

After delivering a blistering verbal lashing to the shameless pair, Gabriela slid inside the car, only to be met by Wesley's glacial stare.

She offered a quick, placating smile. "Don't be upset, Mr. Moss. I've already cut them down so hard they'll be licking their wounds for weeks."

Wesley's chiseled face didn't so much as twitch. He turned to Billy, his tone as cold as his expression."Bring the restaurant manager here."

"Yes, sir," Billy replied at once.

Within minutes, the manager came bustling out, forehead slick with sweat. Bowing slightly, he asked with deference, "What would you like me to do, Mr. Moss?"

"Run the surveillance footage from earlier," Wesley replied, his tone cool and deliberate. "Loop it in the most visible spot in the lobby-for the next three months."

"Consider it done, sir." The manager paused, shifting uneasily."And... should we still serve the guests shown in the footage?"

A shadow of icy malice flickered in Wesley's eyes. "Go ahead and serve them."

Billy's brows shot up, astonished. Now that was ruthless.

Three months was plenty of time for every diner who stepped through the doors to memorize those shameless faces.

And when Phyllis and her friends returned to the restaurant, only to be greeted by their own humiliation playing for all to see... they'd likely wish the gound would split open and swallow them whole.
###Chapter 47 Inebriated
Wesley's directive took Gabriela by surprise.

Phyllis's friends might have been insufferable, but each of their families had enough clout in the city-otherwise, Phyllis would never have kept them in her circle.

Wesley's move was bound to ruffle their feathers.

As Wesley's gaze shifted toward Gabriela, there was a faint shadow of annoyance in his eyes. "What's this?You think I'm pushing them too hard?"

Gabriela immediately shook her head.

She cautioned, "Vivian's brother holds a fair bit of sway. And... there's talk that she has connections with the CEO of the Williams Group."

Most of what Gabriela knew came from Aubrey, who could dig up gossip the way a bloodhound found a scent.

Whether from the entertainment world or the upper echelons of society, Aubrey could sniff out insider news with ease--and she loved spilling it to Gabriela. Thanks to her, Gabriela kept a faint pulse on the quiet intrigues of the elite.

Wesley's expression eased unexpectedly, settling into that cool, imperious calm that suggested such people were hardly a trouble for him. Leaning back in his chair, he closed his eyes, as if the matter had already slipped from his mind.

Taking her cue from his indifference, Gabriela held her tongue, though a private satisfaction curled in her chest at the thought of Phyllis and her friends' humiliation.

After a stretch of silence, a subtle weight pressed against Wesley's shoulder. His eyes opened to find Gabriela slumped gently against him, fast asleep. For a moment, he simply stared, pleasantly surprised.

Gabriela had always maintained a careful distance from him, as if intimidated by his presence-yet today,she'd dared to rest her head on him as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

Was she simply exhausted?

In a voice barely above a breath, Wesley murmured, "Drive slower."

"Yes, sir," Billy answered, though his mind reeled in disbelief.

Gabriela was leaning against Wesley's shoulder. And instead of pushing her away, he actually seerned to welcome it.

What was usually a brisk half-hour ride became a leisurely hour before they finally pulled up to the office.

When Gabriela stirred awake, the realization hit-she'd been using Wesley's shoulder as a pillow. Heat rushed to her cheeks as she straightened, blurting an apology while swiping at the corner of her mouth on instinct.

She was relieved to find she hadn't drooled in her sleep.

Wesley didn't reprimand her for leaning on his shoulder. He let the corners of his mouth lift in quiet amusement before saying in a pleasant tone, "Come on, let's go in."

Still dazed from her nap, Gabriela trailed after him without realizing she was draped in his coat. With a casual air, she stepped right into the company alongside him, even taking his private elevator.

Within thirty minutes, whispers rippled through the building-Gabriela had been spotted wearing Wesley's coat, igniting speculation and unease.

Cali and her two friends were the most rattled.

Gabriela's growing favor with Wesley was starting to look dangerous for them.

No one felt the pressure more than Cali, who had been haunted lately by vivid dreams-Gabriela, looking stunning in luxurious outfits, strode into the sales department as Mrs. Moss, before ordering security to march Cali straight out of the company.

Hearing that Gabriela had strolled back into the company wrapped in Wesley's coat only made her more agitated, racking her brain for a way to make amends.

Aubrey, on the other hand, was positively gleeful.

She'd long suspected Wesley had a soft spot for Gabriela, and now he'd even draped his coat over her shoulders!

If not for the executive office's restricted access, Aubrey would've marched right in to demand every juicy detail about what it felt like to wear Wesley's coat.

Even if Aubrey succeeded in sneaking into the executive office, Gabriela likely wouldn't be able to say a word.

At the moment, she was thoroughly inebriated.

Drunk people behaved in various ways. Some turned loud and unruly, while others looked perfectly composed, their eyes as clear as if they hadn't touched a drop.

Gabriela fell squarely into the latter group.

At first, Wesley saw nothing wrong with her-until he noticed she was trailing him everywhere like a small,determined shadow.

Whenever his long strides pulled him ahead, her fingers would catch his sleeve, refusing to let him slip away.

"Is there something you need to ask?" Wesley glanced back, only to be met with her wide, luminous eyes,her expression soft and vacant.

The sight was unexpectedly endearing.

But then something clicked in his mind, sharpening his gaze. "You're not drunk, are you?"

Gabriela ignored his question. Instead, her lips curved into a faint, dreamy smile. "You're truly a good man,Mr.Moss." Her skin warmed under a delicate flush, the wine leaving its telltale tint across her cheeks. A smile bloomed -playful and innocent enough to make anyone want to lean in, to tease, to steal a kiss.

Wesley had never been the type to deny his desires.

He cupped her face in his hands, savoring the warmth beneath his fingers.

A gentle pinch coaxed her lips into a small pout, her wide, unguarded eyes gazing up at him in a way that stirred something tender within him.

how much have you had?" he said, sighing.

At the restaurant, she'd downed each glass with the poise of a seasoned drinker.

Now, that steady mask had slipped-her cheeks aglow, her eyes hazy-the alcohol had finally claimed her.

The thought gnawed at him.

If she acted this careless with other men, someone could easily take advantage of her.

With a steady hand, he led her to the sofa, easing her down before taking a seat at her side."Any idea who you're talking to right now?"

"Sure I do," she replied instantly, her voice warm with tipsy cheer. "You're Mr. Moss-my boss. And,honestly, you're a remarkably good man."

Wesley's lips curved in quiet amusement.

Even drunk, she still knew how to flatter him.

"Can you tell me where we crossed paths for the very first time?" he asked with a faint smirk.

Tilting her head slightly, Gabriela let a pensive silence linger before giving a nod-then just as quickly, she shook it off.

She was fairly sure their first meeting had been on her interview day, yet some unshakable instinct told her that wasn't the whole truth. Wesley had no illusions about getting a straight answer from someone with alcohol still clouding their mind.

He steered the conversation elsewhere. "That model of the undersea city-when did you put it together,and who was it meant for?"

Her brow creased as if sifting through a foggy memory, then she let out a faint groan and touched her temple. "My head's pounding. Can we talk about something else?" she said softly, her tone almost childlike,as if pleading for mercy after a scolding.

He made no effort to press her. "The lounge has a bed-go stretch out there. A nap will take care of that headache."

Her expression turned earnest. "MMr. Moss, thank you. You really are incredibly kind."

Instead of heading for the bed, she wandered toward the kitchen and almost lowered herself onto the floor as if it were a bed.

With a quiet sigh, Wesley swept her into his arms and carried her straight to the lounge.

After settling her down, he told Billy to bring something to ease the hangover.

When Billy returned, Gabriela was already fast asleep-curled on her side, hands tucked beneath her cheek,the picture of gentle, untroubled innocence.

Wesley lingered by the bed for a moment, cradling the cup of hangover tea in his hand. His gaze softened as he bent to tuck the blanket snugly around her, ensuring no draft could reach her, before slipping out without a sound.

"Mr. Moss," Billy said, masking his surprise behind a neutral tone. "There's a short meeting in ten minutes.Aaron and the others have returned. Do you want to begin as scheduled?"

Beyond his core executives, Wesley maintained a private think tank of six-handpicked elites, with Aaron Dean at the helm.

"Have them come in," Wesley said simply.

"Yes,sir." As Billy stepped out, he cast one last glance toward the lounge, curiosity flickering in his eyes.

The door stood firmly closed, and the silence within offered no hint of life inside.

Gabriela stirred, feeling as though she was waking from a dream that had stretched on forever. Her cheek rested against a pillow soft enough to swallow her whole, the blanket around her carrying that crisp, pine-tinged scent that could only belong to Wesley.

For a heartbeat, she lay there in a fog-until the realization hit like a jolt of cold water. Why, of all places, was she in Wesley's bed again?

Heat rushed to her cheeks. She sprang upright, the blanket slipping away, and darted barefoot to the door.

The moment it swung open, she froze-six members of Wesley's think tank were seated there, all turning in perfect unison to stare straight at her.
###Chapter 48 Will You Drink That Much Again


Gabriela hadn't expected there to be other people in Wesley's office.

Everyone was dressed to perfection in tailored suits, their stern faces carrying the authority of seasoned corporate elites.

But right now, those stern faces were all wearing shocked expressions.

Feeling awkward, Gabriela glanced at Wesley in confusion.

The think tank members also shifted their attention to him.

Wesley, calm as ever, closed the file before him.

His normally cold expression softened slightly. "Feeling better?" he asked.

His voice was nothing like the decisive, commanding tone he'd used moments earlier.

Gabriela couldn't read his expression. She nodded nervously, scrambling for a way to explain why she'd fallen asleep on the job.

Aaron reached for the coffee pot, shooting a quick, puzzled look at Billy.

What on earth was going on? They'd only been away for a little over two weeks, yet Westey seemed different.

Billy kept his posture straight, giving Aaron a subtle look that said to stay calm.

But Aaron was far from calm.

After working with Wesley for a couple of years, he knew his boss had no interest in women. Not even the most dazzling actresses could earn so much as a sideways look from him.

Yet here was a woman, fresh from his private lounge. Aaron's eyes dropped, catching sight of Gabriela's bare feet.

She'd clearly been resting inside.

How close was their famously aloof boss to this woman, bringing her to work like this?

Aaron and his team weren't in the office often, so they had no idea Gabriela had recently been reassigned as Wesley's secretary.

Following Aaron's gaze, Gabriela noticed her bare feet too. Embarrassment prickled as her toes curled.

Once again, she'd made trouble for Wesley.

His brow tightened. "Put your shoes on."

The weather was cold. Maybe he should have someone lay down carpet in here.

Startled by his sharper tone, Gabriela's shoulders hunched.

She'd slept during work, taken over his lounge bed, and now the company's top staff had seen her like this.

Would Wesley fire her?

Without a word, she spun around and dashed back into the lounge.

Her quick, fluid movement carried a natural grace that drew the eye.

Wesley gave her a brief look, then turned to Aaron. "Is she pretty?"

Still reeling from the sight of his unapproachable boss behaving almost tenderly, Aaron blurted,"Absolutely!"

How could he possibly challenge Wesley's taste?

But Wesley's lips pressed into a thin line, his voice suddenly heavy. "You're so distracted by her that you spilled coffee all over my desk?"

Aaron flinched as a scalding splash seared the back of his hand, yanking him out of his daze. Only then did he realize he'd been absentmindedly pouring coffee long past full. He jumped up, fumbling for tissues, only to knock the cup over completely, drenching the documents.

He scrambled to clean It, making an even bigger mess.

Billy and the others were speechless at Aaron's clumsy behavior.

Only minutes ago, they'd been deep in a tense debate over a critical project, no one willing to back down.

The air seemed to hold its breath, as if waiting for something inevitable to unfold.

Then Gabriela had stepped out of the lounge, and the entire room had lost its focus.

They said nothing,pretending it was business as usual.

Wesley offered no explanation. "Meeting adjourned," he said evenly.

For them, that meant they could leave for the day. The think tank members rose quickly and filed out.

Wesley surveyed the mess on his desk, rubbing his temples. "You can come out now," he called toward the lounge.

Gabriela emerged slowly this time, shoes on, head lowered like a child caught misbehaving.

He gave her a sideways glance. "Sober yet?"

She nodded."I'mn really sorry, Mr. Moss."

"What are you apologizing for?"

"I shouldn't have slacked off during work, shouldn't have slept in your bed, and definitely shouldn't have interrupted your meeting."

A faint, resigned chuckle escaped him. She still didn't understand the real issue.

Wesley demanded, "Will you drink that much again?"

If he hadn't been around her today, she could have found herself in serious trouble.

"No," she replied quietly. At least not when she was with Wesley.
Her alcohol tolerance was usually fine-this must have been the wrong kind of drink for her.
Wesley motioned toward the hangover tea he'd set aside. "Heat this up and drink it."
Gabriela hadn't expected him to prepare this for her, and the gesture left her touched. It seemed he wouldn't fire her-at least not for now.
She quickly brought the tea into the kitchen.
Wesley's gaze shifted to Billy, who lingered at the edge of the room, all but melting into the background."Call my driver. Have him drive Gabriela home," Wesley said.
Although she seemed fine now, he couldn't risk letting her take the bus alone.
"Yes, sir," Billy replied smoothly, though his mind was spinning.
The executive office was a hive of activity-year-end loomed, two major projects raced against tight deadlines, and annual reports poured in from every department and subsidiary.
Everyone was so swamped they hardly had a moment to grab a sip of water, and even Wesley was practically living at the office these days.
Yet Gabriela had spent the afternoon sleeping, and now she was being sent home in a company car.
As a seasoned professional, Billy maintained a composed exterior, though beneath the surface, his thoughts churned in restless currents.
After contacting the private driver, Billy turned to Gabriela with a courteous, businesslike tone. "Miss Haynes, since you're unwell, Mr. Moss has arranged for you to be driven home."
Gabriela quickly thanked Wesley and followed Billy out.
Only in the hallway did she whisper, "I didn't... do anything inappropriate to Mr. Moss earlier, didl?"
Her memory was hazy-she only remembered leaning on Wesley's shoulder as if it were a pillow, refusing to let go, and attempting to sleep on the kitchen floor before he carried her to the lounge.
The rest was a blur.

Billy's eyes narrowed slightly.

Her uncertain tone made him wonder-had she done something improper with Wesley without his knowledge?

"You might want to go easy on the drinking next time," he advised.

Gabriela's heart sank.

So she had done something wrong.

With the company so busy, the fact Wesley wasn't asking her to work overtime could only mean one thing-he doubted her reliability.

How could she fix her image in his eyes?

A $28, 000 monthly salary wasn't something she could replace easily.

Lowering her voice, she asked, "I'm actually feeling pretty okay, Mr. Clarke. Is there any work I can help with?"

"Your health comes first," Billy said firmly. "Just rest and come in on time tomorrow."

Like hell he'd allow Gabriela to work overtime after Wesley told her to leave.

With no other choice, Gabriela headed home, her mood heavy.
###Chapter 49 Special Gift


Gabriela stepped into the living room to find Phyllis sunk into the couch, her cheeks blotchy and puffed,glaring at her with murderous intensity.

Those reddened eyes burned with the kind of rage that begged for an outlet, and Gabriela could almost feel the hostility vibrating in the air between them.

At the sight of Phyllis, Gabriela's lingering gloom evaporated, replaced by a sharp jolt of adrenaline.

"Vivian will be in detention for three days," Phyllis snapped. "When she's out, her brother will tear into her-and I bet you're just thrilled about that."

Vivian, furious over her own predicament, had already taken her anger out on Phyllis simply because she was related to Gabriela.

Gabriela gave a slow shake of her head.

Phyllis let out a short, sharp laugh. "Too late to start trembling now. Enjoy it while you can-Vivian's gonna makeyour life a living hell the second she's out."

"Thrilled? Not quite," Gabriela stated evenly."Vivian struts around like she's untouchable, hiding behind her precious connections. Three days in a cell? That's barely a slap on the wrist. Three months-that might feel like justice." Her gaze stayed locked on Phyllis, unflinching. "And you, the puppet master in the shadows,walk around free while she takes the fall. That's what pisses me off the most."

Phyllis had a knack for manipulation, always managing to get someone else to do her dirty work. Even if the scheme backfired,the fallout never touched her.

Phyllis's brows knitted into a sharp line as she retorted, "Don't get ahead of yourself. No way your precious boss can keep saving your ass forever."

Gabriela's eyes hardened, her voice like ice. "That's not something you need to worry about. But if you're itching for trouble, I'll gladly rip out every last strand of your hair." The vivid threat sent a phantom sting across Phyllis's scalp, rekindling every past grievance and fueling the fresh anger burning in her chest. She shot to her feet, poised to lunge at Gabriela.

At that moment, a sharp, commanding voice sliced through the tension. "Enough."

Marie swept down the stairs, her heels striking the wood with crisp authority, her gaze like a blade locking on Phylis. "You've already made a fool of yourself today. Go to your room."

Phyllis's hands flew to her cheeks, as if shielding them from another blow, the memory of Marie's earlier slap still burning on her skin. "Mom, Gabriela-" she began, her tone wobbling with grievance.

"You're on the verge of marriage," Marie cut Phyllis off, her voice frosted with warning. "Don't stir up trouble again-just wait for your wedding day." Her eyes narrowed, a glint of steel flashing beneath the cool surface."Dustin works hard. He's ambitious. You should be focusing on building your future with him, not creating petty scenes."

Truth be told, Marie had never approved of Dustin. In her view, a proper son-in-law needed to match their status without question-and Dustin simply didn't measure up.

Yet Phyllis had always had a knack for snatching up whatever belonged to Gabriela-and now she'd taken Gabriela's ex, Dustin, for herself. Without so much as a word to Marie, she had announced the engagement,and with gossip already swirling in their circle, Marie could hardly object without causing a scene.

Still, Dustin had his merits. He was sharp, ambitious, and, with the right guidance-and a tight enough leash -he could be molded into a useful ally.

Phyllis, however, simmered with frustration.

The fiasco at Grace Robuchon hadn't dragged Gabriela down; if anything, it had made her shine brighter.

And now, even Marie had turned against her, harshly ordering her to stay away from Gabriela for the moment.

Phyllis couldn't fathom why the hell she would fear an orphan-a girl she had crushed under her heel since childhood. Still, the sting in her swollen cheeks was a sharp reminder not to test Marie's temper again. She settled for shooting Gabriela avenomous look, her hatred simmering.
The wedding was locked in for the year's end, the day creeping ever closer. She needed to concentrate-but she also vowed that when the day came, she'd find a way to disgrace Gabriela and her sugar daddy.
Marie dismissed Phyllis back to her room, pausing only to flick Gabriela a cool, measuring glance before saying nothing at all.
News of the Grace Robuchon Incident had already swept through their circle, cementing Gabriela's standing in Wesley's eyes.
Yet anyone could see she and Phyllis were on opposite sides, and Gabriela had no intention of smoothing a path for her to get close to Wesley.
Since winning Gabriela over had proven impossible, Marie decided she'd crush her completely-wipe her out so thoroughly that she'd never recover.
For now, though, she was still plotting her move, keeping her claws sheathed in an uncharacteristic break.In the days that followed, Gabriela experienced the calmest period she'd known in years-no threats to her job, and not a single appearance from Phyllis to wreak havoc in her life.
And there was another small spark of anticipation on the horizon.
in less than a week, the company would shut down for the holiday break.
The office hummed with energy-despite the mounting workload, chatter about travel plans filled every corner.
Gabriela wasn't especially excited about the holiday itself, yet the long-standing tradition of receiving a generous gift from the company had its own quiet allure.
This would be her first since joining the company, and she couldn't help anticipating what might be inside the one waiting for her.
The sales department received theirs first-each woman unwrapping a high-end cosmetics set, while the men were presented with sleek, pricey watches.
Wesley had a business dinner that day and didn't take Gabriela along, leaving her free to grab lunch in the cafeteria with Aubrey.
Aubrey was beaming as she slipped off her wristwatch to show it off-a sleek mechanical piece from an accessible luxury brand, priced at eighteen hundred.
"This would easily sell for three thousand outside. Our boss must've gotten a great deal!" she exclaimed,admiring the polished steel face with a lovestruck expression.
The company's year-end gifts were technically divided by gender, but employees were free to choose what suited them best.
Tilting her head, Gabriela inquired, genuinely curious, "So why go for a men's watch?"
"What am I going to do with a box of cosmetics?" Aubrey chuckled, her eyes dancing. "I'm naturally gorgeous-I don't need makeup yet. But this? This is perfect as a New Year's gift for Kevin. He's going to love it."
Gabriela simply pressed her lips together, saying nothing.
Kevin Hewitt was Aubrey's boyfriend. They had weathered five years of long-distance, yet their bond only seemed to deepen, steady and warm as family ties.
Gabriela pictured Kevin's quiet stubbornness, that faint shadow of brooding in his eyes, but she kept the thought locked away.
Later that afternoon, once Wesley strode back into the office, Gabriela drifted after him with an energy she could hardly hide.
It wasn't the luxury cosmetics themselves that stirred her excitement-more the festive buzz in the air, the idea of unboxing her gift and snapping a flawless photo to post online.
One glance at her bright, expectant face, and Wesley seemed to read her thoughts instantly. He summoned Billy with a crisp word, instructing him to distribute the executive office's year-end presents. Gabriela practically bounced as she followed Billy out, joining Tessa and the others in the corridor.

Even Tessa, usually so composed, allowed herself a relaxed smile as she swapped stories with Gabriela about the lavish gifts from years past.

Tessa's smile brimmed with pride as she remarked, "Our company just keeps getting better, and so do the year-end gifts. Mr. Moss really knows how to spoil us."

Last year, employees had gone home with crates of premium fruit and a generous shopping card. This year,the presents had taken another leap in value.

Gabriela's eyes lit up in delight.

She'd never worked under a boss as lavish as Wesley, doling out gifts worth well over a thousand.

On top of that, no one was overlooked-senior staff and fresh recruits alike received the same treatment.

Tessa, as head of the executive office, moved from desk to desk, personally handing out the neatly packaged presents.

Gabriela lingered nearby, anticipation building with every passing moment. But when the last gift left Tessa's hands, nothing had come her way.

Blinking in surprise, she leaned in and lowered her voice. "Ms. Ortiz... am I not getting one?"

A cold thought crept in-was she being left out because she'd only just transferred into the executive office,her name too new to make the list?

Tessa's lips curved into a kgowing smile. "Billy mentioned yours is already on Mr. Moss's desk."

Gabriela wasted no time heading back, her heart beating faster with anticipation. Stopping beside Wesley's desk,she leaned forward slightly. "Mr. Moss, Ms. Ortiz said my gift's here with you?"

Glancing up from the neat stack of documents before him, Wesley caught the spark in her eyes and let a faintly amused smile tug at his lips. He reached for a small bag and held it out to her. "This is yours."

Gabriela accepted it, blinking in surprise. The gift bag was wrapped beautifully, yet noticeably different from what she'd seen earlier-and at least two-thirds smaller than the ones her colleagues had received.

Just as her fingers found the ribbon, Wesley's low voice cut in. "Open it at home."

"Alright, Mr. Moss."

Though a flicker of curiosity tugged at her, Gabriela let it go,content simply to have the gift in her hands.

She slid the bag to the corner of her desk and carried on with her tasks until the evening bell. Once home,the moment the door clicked shut behind her, she tossed her keys aside and eagerly retrieved a small box from inside the bag.

Its dark golden velvet shimmered under the light, the texture alone whispering of luxury.

This wasn't the glossy cosmetic set the women received, nor the sleek timepiece given to the men. It was something else entirely.

Recalling how Wesley had been shielding her these past few days, her cheeks grew warm, her pulse quickening in spite of herself.

What could he possibly have chosen for her?

She drew in a breath, steadying her hands, and slowly lifted the lid.
###Chapter 50 Disappointment


Nestled inside the box was a modest, unremarkable bracelet, its only decoration a tiny Cupid charm dangling from the chain.

Gabriela stared at it in disbelief, turning the box this way and that, even tilting it as if a more impressive gift might be hidden beneath the velvet lining.

But no matter how many times she checked, the truth remained-this was all there was.

For God's sake! While her colleagues unwrapped company gifts worth over a thousand dollars, all she got was some flimsy fifty-dollar bracelet.

Was this Wesley's way of getting back at her for that humiliating incident a few days ago-falling asleep in his bed and embarrassing him in front of his elite think tank?

She knew the man too well. Wesley Moss never forgot a slight, and he certainly wasn't the type to forgive without extracting his own quiet revenge.

All that anticipation had fizzled into disappointment.

Her phone suddenly chimed, and a WhatsApp message from Aubrey popped up, asking if she'd unwrapped her gift yet. "Plenty of colleagues are posting theirs and singing Mr. Moss's praises. You'd better get yours up too-show some loyalty."

Gabriela stared at the screen, her mood too sour for such theatrics. She tapped back a curt, "Yeah."

It struck her then-Aubrey had joined the company only a few days after she had. Aubrey's gift was the standard year-end gift, and Gabriela had been truly happy for her. So why was she the only one singled out for something different?

The thought left her with a hollow, unsettled feeling.

The next morning, she walked into the office with a faint heaviness lingering in her chest. As she lingered by the elevator, Gabriela crossed paths with Aubrey, who was beaming. Aubrey chattered away about how she'd given Kevin the watch last night and how he'd been thrilled with it.

The mention made Gabriela think of her own plain, unimpressive bracelet, and a wave of bitterness curled in her chest.

Catching the faint shadow in Gabriela's expression, Aubrey tilted her head. "You look exhausted, Gabriela.Rough night?"

Gabriela hesitated, then asked, "Did everyone get the same year-end gift?"

Aubrey tilted her head, puzzled. "It was either cosmetics or a watch for everyone..." She suddenly blinked,eyes widening in surprise. "Hold on-don't tell me your gift wasn't the same as ours?"

Gabriela sighed, her expression shadowed with disappointment. "My gift is neither cosmetics nor a watch."

Aubrey leaned in, intrigued. "Come on, tell me-what did Mr. Moss end up giving you?"

"A simple bracelet, nothing fancy."

Brows lifting, Aubrey stared. "You're joking. Not even a pendant with it?"

It was puzzling-Wesley had been showering the staff with high-end cosmetics and stylish watches. Why would Gabriela be singled out for something so plain? The thought didn't sit right with her.

With her expression downcast, Gabriela muttered, "Just a plain bracelet, a tiny Cupid charm on it... came in a pretty little box,that's all."

Aubrey tilted her head, frowning for a moment before her eyes brightened. "You know what Cupid stands for..."

"Don't even start. No way." Gabriela's tone was firm, cutting Aubrey off mid-thought. "Let's not spin this into something it isn't."

To someone like Wesley, a gift so ordinary could only be a quiet nudge-straighten up at work or watch your perks shrink away. There was no chance it carried the meaning Aubrey-or her own wandering mind-was trying to pin on it.

Aubrey tilted her head, curiosity flickering in her eyes. "So what's the deal? Why would Mr. Moss hand you a bracelet like that?" Her suspicion deepened. "Don't tell me there wasn't some other meaning behind it."

Gabriela gave a wry smile and recounted what had happened the other day. "I'd been drinking too much and somehow ended up crawling into Mr. Moss's lounge bed. When I woke up, I bolted out of there barefoot and ran into him during a meeting with his think tank... Mr. Moss must be upset with me about that."

Aubrey sensed holes in the story but couldn't quite pin them down. In the end, she only gave Gabriela a half-grinning thumbs-up. "You've got guts, Gabriela."

Leaning back, Gabriela murmured with a hint of gloom, "Truth is, I only drank that day to keep things smooth with Mr. Garner. But instead of remembering what I did right, Mr. Moss just clings to my one mistake and won't drop it. Honestly, he's so petty."

The elevator chimed, and she and Aubrey stepped inside, Aubrey murmuring a few more words of comfort.

By the time Gabriela reached the CEO's office,Wesley had already been there.

His face was set in a grim line, a faint shadow of displeasure in his eyes. She offered a polite greeting,but he breezed past as if he hadn't heard a thing, peeling off his coat and diving straight into work.

Suppressing a sigh, Gabriela slipped into the kitchen and set about brewing his coffee.

A few minutes later, she placed the steaming cup on his desk. "Your coffee, Mr. Moss."

Even if the year-end gift let her down, she still had to guard her generous.paycheck like her life depended on it.

Gabriela brushed off her sour mood and slipped seamlessly into her usual, razor-sharp work rhythm.

Across the desk, Wesley shut the file with deliberate finality, his fingers drumming against the polished surface. His eyes were cool as winter steel. "Not happy with the present you got yesterday?"

The mention of the present made heat rush to her chest. She'd swallowed her feelings all night,but now that he'd brought it up, the words tumbled out before she could stop them."So why was I the only one who His gaze hardened instantly, shadows cutting across his face.

"In this entire executive office, aside from Tessa and Billy, you're the highest-paid employee here," he said,each word clipped.

And yet she'd still had the nerve to call him petty behind his back.

Gabriela's voice tightened with quiet indignation. "I'm not just your secretary-I'm also your cook and housekeeper. I often work overtime deep into the night with you. And now, everyone else gets the same gift while mine's different. How do you think that makes me look in front of my colleagues? They'll start doubting whether I can even do my job."

Wesley let out a low, mocking chuckle. "And remind me-how exactly did you land a spot in the executive office?"

The insinuation hit like a slap, as if he'd just declared she'd gotten here through anything but skill.

Her mind flashed to those damning WhatsApp screenshots, souring her mood even further. She muttered,"I apologize for speaking poorly about you behind your back."

His gaze sharpened, a faint smirk playing on his lips. "Oh? So you're not scared of me anymore? Already bold enough to talk back?"

Gabriela kept her lips pressed shut, unwilling to risk another word.

Wesley-craving both praise and submission from those around him-was as conceited as he was domineering.

Aubrey had even hinted that he might be a little interested in her.

If this was his idea of showing interest, she didn't dare imagine how ruthless he'd be if he wasn't.

Wesley's gaze lingered on her bowed head, her downcast eyes, and that flicker of defiance she was swallowing back. The combination made him smirk. He said, voice firm and unyielding. "Wear the bracelet on your right wrist tomorrow."

The way he issued the order left no room for discussion, and Gabriela knew without a doubt-he was doing this purely to toy with her.

Wearing that bracelet would be like announcing to the entire company that she hadn't received a proper gift.

With her shoulders sinking, she managed a quiet, "Yes, sir."

Later that day, Aubrey clocked out alongside Gabriela and coaxed her into a shopping trip, suggesting they get their hair done.

"Once the holiday starts, I'll be spending eight full days with Kevin in Dialand! No way I'm showing up looking anything less than perfect," Aubrey said wwith a wink.

For many office workers, getting a fresh hairstyle before the New Year was almost a sacred tradition.

But Gabriela's paycheck still hadn't come through, and the knot of worry in her stomach kept her from spending freely. She passed on the salon and settled for picking out two new outfits instead.

Later, she and Aubrey tucked into a steaming pot of stew, the rich aroma and easy chatter finally sweeping away the last of her gloom.

That night, stretched out in bed, Gabriela absently scrolled through her WhatsApp messages.

Brenden's name still sat there,stubbornly silent.

The promise he'd made to be her plus-one at the wedding now felt like nothing more than a careless remark tossed into the air-words he'd never intended to keep.

It seemed as if misfortune had been dogging her heels for weeks. Once the holiday break came,she vowed,she'd book a long meditation session and scrub the bad energy from her life like dust from a mirror.

At the same time, Brenden, feeling just as cursed by fate, grudgingly shoveled up yet another mound of dirt.

For nearly half a month, he'd been toiling under the watchful eye of the team leader, clawing his way barely two meters down-still without a trace of water.

More and more, he wondered if the leader and Wesley had conspired to keep him trapped in this grueling task.

With a grunt, he flung another load of dirt aside, his clothes and hair caked in dust, and glanced up at the well walls towering above his head.

The thought struck him with grim humor-this didn't feel like digging for water anymore. It felt like he was carving out his own grave.
 ###Chapter 51 Was She That Into Him





The memory of Wesley's stern, unrelenting expression sent a shiver through Brenden. He couldn't endure the current situation a moment longer-he had to change it.


Without hesitation, he dialed Loretta.


First, he charmed her with sweet words until her laughter filled the line. Then, adopting a wistful tone,he confessed how much he missed her, lamenting that his work in Afluena kept him from returning home for the New Year. He poured out apologies,his voice heavy with regret.


Loretta felt sorry for him. "I'll talk to Wesley," she promised.


Brenden's spirits soared, and he showered her with more affectionate words before ending the call.


Loretta wasted no time, immediately phoning Wesley to insist he transfer Brenden back. "Wesley, you and Brenden are family. How could you leave him struggling in Afluena? The New Year is for family and celebration. I want Brenden here with me! If he doesn't come back, don't bother showing up!"
Faced with Loretta's ultimatum, Wesley relented, and Brenden was granted permission to return that same day.He booked a flight home at once.
Upon arriving, he brought local specialties from Afluena as a peace offering for Wesley.
"Wesley, I'm not good at digging wells," Brenden admitted. "I swear I'll work harder from now on. Just please don't make me go back there."
Wesley's gaze remained cold, barely acknowledging him.
A flicker of unease stirred in Brenden. Recalling Fiona's words, he lowered his voice. "I've been watching videos lately, picking up some sharp insults. If you're curious, I could share a few in private..." Wesley's eyes finally shifted to him.
That cold stare made Brenden's knees buckle, his confidence shrinking.
Brenden pressed on, "They say genius and madness are close cousins. You're brilliant, so a peculiar hobby is understandable. You don't have to-"
Before he could finish, Wesley tapped the desk with deliberate force.
"Get out," Wesley commanded.
Brenden persisted, "Just listen-"
But Billy appeared, flanked by two towering bodyguards, who swiftly escorted Brenden out of the office.
Brenden brushed off the humiliation of being tossed out. It was still better than being sent back to Afluena.
He smoothed his suit, feigning nonchalance, and strode confidently toward the company's exit. "Mr. Saunders, please wait!"


A clear, melodic voice stopped him in his tracks.


Turning,Brenden saw Gabriela hurrying toward him.


There was a certain elegance in her approach.Brenden felt a spark of excitement.


Gabriela had heard of Brenden's return, astonished by Aubrey's accurate tip, yet quietly thrilled.


The moment he exited Wesley's office, she chased after him.



She stopped before him, her eyes sparkling with delight. "You're finally back!"


Brenden found it strange.


Gabriela usually gave him the cold shoulder. Why the sudden warmth? Could his time in Afluena, with a slight tan to show for it, have somehow boosted his allure?


His mood brightened. He swept back his bangs,certain his hairstyle was on point, and flashed what  he deemed his most charming smile. "Hey, Gabriela. I just saw you in Wesley's office.How'd you end up on the twelfth floor?" he asked.
Gabriela looked at him warily.
He was the one who'd snitched with screenshots,landing her in Wesley's bad books. Why act clueless now? But this wasn't the right moment to confront him.She had something more pressing on her mind.
Forcing a polite smile, she sidestepped the topic."Will you be available a week from today?"
Seven days later marks the third day of the company's holiday, coinciding with Phyllis's wedding.Brenden's surprise only deepened.
He'd rarely spoken to Gabriela before, and her sudden friendliness caught him off guard.
But then he thought of the young starlet he'd recently started seeing, the thrill still fresh. He couldn't betray her.


Although a flirt by nature, Brenden had his principles.Two-timing wasn't his style.


With a touch of regret, he shook his head. "I get what you're suggesting, but I've already got a girlfriend."


Gabriela was at a loss for words.



She knew Brenden's list of girlfriends was endless,and he never shied away from pursuing even the most aloof women.



Why, when she needed a favor, was he suddenly dodging her? Was he intentionally making this difficult?



She quickly reassured him, "Don't worry. If we run into your girlfriend, I'll clear things up so there's no misunderstanding."


She only needed him to pretend to be her boyfriend for one day. What were the odds they'd bump into his girlfriend? But then a troubling thought hit her.


Brenden had too many girlfriends. What if one showed up at Phyllis's wedding? The chaos would be unimaginable.


Since Brenden was already worried about his girlfriend getting the wrong idea, Gabriela realized she shouldn't press him.


Brenden thought he'd misheard.


Gabriela knew he had a girlfriend, but instead of getting upset, she offered to explain things to her if his girlfriend ran into them.


Was she that into him?



Brenden wavered. He didn't want to lose the starlet he'd just won over, but turning down someone like Gabriela was tough.


He hesitated. "Does it have to be me?"


Seeing his indecision, Gabriela realized she'd need to find another stand-in boyfriend. She had heard of services where you could hire a boyfriend. With the right choice, it could pass convincingly.


Brenden misinterpreted Gabriela's thoughtful expression as disappointment, stirring a pang of guilt within him.



He reached out, intending to pat her shoulder in comfort.



But a cold voice interrupted. "Brenden!"


At the sound, Brenden froze, yanking his hand back.


He flashed a fawning smile and turned to face Wesley, who was approaching. "Any instructions for me?"



Wesley's gaze swept over Gabriela, his expression unreadable.


"Mr. Moss," Gabriela greeted, projecting calm while panicking inside.


She was in trouble. Brenden was likely still on Wesley's bad side, and sneaking out to talk to him could have put her there too.


Wesley's voice was flat. "Your forty-first girlfriend is in the café over there, Brenden."


Brenden wandered toward the café in a daze, only realizing halfway there that it struck him: when did he have so many girlfriends?


Gabriela was as much floored.


She knew Brenden already had thirty-eight girlfriends. How had he managed to add three more after just one trip to Afluena?


No wonder he backed out of his promise to pretend to be her boyfriend.


Meanwhile, Wesley was already heading back to the company,his very presence radiating frost.


Snapping out of her shock, Gabriela hurried after him, whispering, "Mr. Moss, I only stopped to greet Mr. Saunders because I heard he was back." Inwardly, she prayed Wesley's grudge against Brenden wouldn't spill over to her.


Yet her explanation was a weak excuse to Wesley;he didn't believe a word of it.


A spark of irritation flared in his chest.
###Chapter 52 Picking Out A Suit For Him
Gabriela froze, startled by the sudden shift in Wesley's expression.


The air between them seemed to tighten.


Wesley let out a low, derisive laugh. "It's work hours.Why aren't you on the twelfth floor where you belong? What business do you have here?"


He couldn't fathom what went through her mind day after day.



Hadn't he been more than generous with her? Or were his signals still too faint for her to grasp? He'd even gifted her a bracelet, yet her reaction fell far short of what he'd anticipated. Nothing. Not a single word of gratitude.



Her lips parted, but no words came. The flat calm on his face did nothing to lessen the suffocating weight pressing down on her.


She dropped her gaze, shoulders curving inward.


With someone like Wesley, she knew, even the most artfully spun lie would be stripped bare in an instant.



Sometimes the wisest move was to surrender before the battle began.



Wesley's gaze lingered on Gabriela's features.


He remembered the feel of her lips beneath his-the way she had melted against him that night, soft and unresisting, giving him everything without holding back.



After a beat, his gaze slipped lower, landing on her neatly clasped hands and the bracelet glinting on her right wrist.



Against the smoothness of her skin, the simple piece stood out all the more, and the sight filled him with an unexpected tenderness. The sharp edge in his expression eased; his voice,
though still clipped, no longer carried the same frost.His brows, however, stayed knitted. "Let's go," he murmured.
Gabriela instantly fell in step beside him, trailing Wesley as they returned to the office.
The rest of the day pressed forward without pause.Wesley was swamped-signing papers in swift,decisive strokes, flipping through reports that demanded his personal approval, his focus unbroken.
By four in the afternoon, the company's think tank had been summoned for another brief meeting, once again dissecting the intricacies of an overseas project.
All in all, Wesley remained too consumed by work to spare a moment for whatever reckoning he might have had in mind for Gabriela.
Gabriela let out a quiet breath of relief and busied herself at the coffee machine, brewing fresh cups for everyone in the room.What caught her attention, though,was how Aaron and the others accepted their cups-each one meeting her eyes, offering a warm smile, and thanking her more than once.


It struck her as almost old-fashioned courtesy, the kind you rarely saw anymore. No wonder they'd risen to the top; these were people polished in both intellect and manners.


That night, when most of the office had long since emptied, Gabriela stayed behind of her own accord,taking on whatever tasks she could to lighten Wesley's load-stacking files into neat piles, sorting through folders, and condensing key points into clean summaries.


As the clock's hands inched toward ten,she quietly slipped away to the kitchenette, returning with a tray bearing a steaming late-night meal.


The aroma curled warmly through the room,softening the stark chill of the hour. Wesley's furrowed brow loosened, and for the first time all evening, the steel in his expression eased. When he finally spoke, his voice had a rough, low timbre, threaded with unexpected gentleness. "It's already late. I will have my driver take you home."


The sudden gentleness caught her off guard. "You're not calling it a night,Mr.Moss?"


"There are still a few documents left to handle," he answered in a calm, measured tone, before calling over Trey Wilcox, the driver, and instructing him to see her home.


Trey had given Gabriela rides a handful of times,enough for their exchanges to feel easy. As the car eased into motion, she glanced his way. "Does Mr.Moss usually stay this late?"


"When he was starting out, pulling all-nighters and crashing at the office was just routine," Trey remarked, his voice casual, almost offhand.


That nonchalant answer hit her harder than she expected,a faint ache tugging at her chest.


Wesley might shine under the spotlight now, commanding the room with his presence, but behind that success lay nights spent grinding through exhaustion, climbing one step at a time.


Maybe she should try to upset him less in the future.


Bad temper, distant manner, unpredictable moods-yes, he had all of those. But he had also handed her a career worth having, and with it, a confidence she'd never thought she could own.


Her thoughts scattered when her phone lit up, the name "NotASaunders" flashing across the screen."Pick out a suit worth at least six figures. I'll be going with you to that wedding."


Gabriela blinked at the words, her brain stalling.


Six figures? How damn much was that supposed to be?



Her fingers twitched as she mentally counted zeroes.Was Brenden out of his mind?


With that kind of money, she could hire ten handsome stand-ins-each one more than happy to play the part of her devoted boyfriend.


She was seconds away from turning him down when another notification flashed across her screen-this time listing his suit measurements.


The first thing she noticed was his height: six foot two of towering presence.


Gabriela knew Wesley's stats by heart, and that number was unmistakably his.


Brenden, on the other hand, was at least half a head shorter. Did he seriously expect her to believe he'd suddenly shot up to six-two?


Ordering a suit was one thing, but padding his height out of sheer ego was just... pathetic.


Scrolling down, she froze.


Oh, for heaven's sake-the waistline, chest,every detail had been lifted wholesale from Wesley's impeccable build.


Had Brenden completely lost his mind? If she actually went through with the order, she might as well toss her money into the nearest drain.


Still, she supposed, renting a stand-in boyfriend wasn't exactly the picture of dependability either.


She opened her banking app and stared at the numbers on the screen.


Two months' salary-hardly a fortune-and the small sum she'd scraped together from part-time jobs back in school barely padded the balance. Even combined, it was nowhere near six figures.


Brenden's request was utterly outrageous.


She typed a cautious reply. "Mr. Saunders, could we aim for something more reasonable? Say, fifty thousand?"



That was practically her whole life savings-barely sixty thousand-and spending fifty on a single suit would gut her account.


The screen stayed blank. No reply. He probably didn't even think she was worth answering.
By the time she stepped through her front door,Phyllis was sprawled on the couch, phone pressed to her ear, her tone dripping with mockery. Gabriela caught snatches of conversation-words like "playboy" and "backup girlfriend" curling through the air.
Seeing Gabriela return, Phyllis ended her call, her gaze sweeping slowly from head to toe. There was something unsettling in her expression-a strange blend of appraisal and smug satisfaction.
Gabriela wondered Phyllis was slipping into sheer madness.
Phyllis's lips curved into a taunting smile. "Only a week until my wedding. So, where's this mysterious boyfriend of yours? Got him all polished up and ready?"
Gabriela met her stare with a cool, measured look."Why don't you focus on your wedding preparations with Dustin? Or is your freeloader already starting to bore you?"


The jab wiped the smirk off Phyllis's face, but only for a heartbeat. She gave a low, mocking laugh."You've got a pretty sharp tongue, don't you? You've guarded that boyfriend of yours like some state secret. Just don't show up with someone so pathetic that my dad ends up regretting inviting you."


Without dignifying that with an answer, Gabriela brushed past Phyllis and disappeared into her room.


The following day brought payday at the office.


Those who had officially cleared probation were also granted year-end bonuses, the amounts scaled by how long they'd been with the company.


The upbeat mood was infectious, sweeping through every corner of the office.


Gabriela felt buoyant herself-she'd been counting on a paycheck of twenty-eight thousand.


But when the salary notification landed, the number blinking back at her was more than twice what she'd expected.


She knew she worked hard and met her responsibilities, but no amount of diligence could explain a bonus that generous.


Gabriela adored money-every crisp bill and every growing digit in her account-but this felt almost unearned. The question gnawed at her until she finally sought Billy out.


He met her gaze with a knowing look. "That came straight from Mr. Moss."


Her brows knit in confusion.


Even after turning it over in her mind for ages, she still couldn't fathom why Wesley had chosen to give her so much.



In that instant, a new message from"NotASaunders"lit up her screen. "Got your salary yet? Is it enough for you to buy me a suit now?"


Gabriela froze for a second, momentarily thrown off. Brenden wasn't even in the office, yet it felt as if his eyes were on her every move.
How on earth did he know the instant her paycheck landed?
And now, with her salary added to her modest savings, her total just nudged past six figures.
It meant she no longer had an excuse-she would have to buy the suit.
"I'll pick it up after work," she hurriedly typed back.
His reply came instantly. "Get Drummond & Gallant to make me a first-rate suit, fully tailored."
Drummond & Gallant-the name alonecarried weight in Okburg. An exclusive atelier, famous for tailoring bespoke suits that were as much status symbols as they were clothing.
Gabriela clenched her jaw and tapped out a single reply."Fine."
When the workday finally ended,she made her way straight to the mall, slipping into the polished, glass-fronted Drummond & Gallant boutique.


She didn't risk calling Aubrey, so she went alone.


Armed with the measurements Brenden had sent over on WhatsApp, she placed the order, only for the sales assistant to inform her, with an apologetic smile, that a bespoke suit would take at least a month to complete.



Gabriela blinked, caught off guard. "Isn't there any way to speed it up?"


The sales assistant shook her head gently, her tone patient but firm. If they rushed the process, she explained, the inner canvas of a fully lined suit could warp, compromising both its structure and longevity.


And when the suit was finally ready,the client would still need to come in for a fitting to fine-tune the cut.


Noticing the worry flcker across Gabriela's face, the sales assistant pulled a suit from the rack and offered a reassuring smile. "This one matches the measurements you gave exactly. If you're alright with it, you can take it home today."


The suit's cut was refined-angled slant pockets set just so, a crisp lapel line, three-button cuffs, and a sleek single-breasted front.


As Gabriela's gaze lingered on the garment, an unbidden image rose in her mind: Wesley wearing it,every line of the suit molded to his tall frame,exuding that sharp, commanding presence that turned heads.He would look devastatingly good.


But reality came crashing back the moment she thought of her bank account balance. The heaviness in her chest felt painfully real.


"I'll take this one," she said at last, her tone heavy with reluctant resolve.


The sales assistant reached for the wrapping paper,but before she could begin, a cool, imperious voice cut in from behind Gabriela. "Excuse me-could I take a look at that suit?"
###Chapter 53 Bring Me A Million





The grating, syrupy voice scraped against Gabriela's nerves the moment it reached her ears. She didn't even need to look-Vivian. The same woman who had once tried to ruin her at Grace Robuchon by accusing her of stealing a necklace.



Gabriela didn't bother to turn around and look at Vivian because of their grudges.


The sales assistant, still perfectly composed,offered a courteous explanation. "I'm sorry, Miss. This is a limited-edition piece, and there's only one set available."


Vivian let out a bright, almost giddy laugh. "Only one set? Perfect-I'll take it!"


A rare piece like this had been what she needed to give her brother and keep him off her back.


Still smiling, the sales assistant shook her head slightly and stated,"Miss Haynes has already reserved it."


At that, Vivian's gaze darted straight to Gabriela, her voice sharpening to a blade. "And what exactly are you doing here?"


Gabriela slid her card across the counter, her tone brisk as she told the sales assistant to wrap the suit.


"None of your business." She turned, her lips curling into a frosty smile. "What-do you own this place now?"



From the moment they were classmates in high school, Vivian had looked at Gabriela with nothing but disdain.



At Grace Robuchon, she had once falsely accused Gabriela of stealing her necklace-all for the pleasure of publicly searching her and savoring her humiliation.



But fate had flipped the script that day. Gabriela had been dining with her boss, and Vivian's scheming backfired so spectacularly, she wound up in custody for three days.


When she finally got out, her older brother had ripped into her, then locked her at home for a long stretch to reflect.



Today's outing was only possible because he'd allowed her to tag along with Phyllis on a gift-shopping trip.


And of course-because life had a twisted sense of humor-the very first person she bumped into was Gabriela.What miserable luck!



With a voice dripping sarcasm, Vivian drawled,"Why is it that every time I step into an upscale place, I find you there too? So Phyllis was right all along-you actually bagged yourself a guy with deep pockets."


She swept a pointed glance around the store.where on earth is he now? Not here to swipe his card for you?"

 
Gabriela's lips curved in a sugar-sweet smile, though the chill in her gaze could have frozen glass. "I'm paying for my boyfriend's clothes myself-why would I make him pay?"


That smile was the one thing Vivian despised most,and the sight of it made her blood boil. "Have you even looked at the price tag on that suit? That's a hundred grand-your entire year's salary, if that.I know you want to make your boyfriend happy, but this purchase will make every bill payment painful."


Her tone sharpened with feigned generosity. "Tell you what-sell it to me for double. You can walk away richer, and spare yourself the trouble."


Gabriela's head snapped toward Vivian as she replied, "Double the price?"


"Absolutely." Vivian's chin tilted, her smirk dripping with condescension, already picturing Gabriela losing her temper.


Before the tension could spark further, Phyllis stepped in, her voice sugar-coated. "Gabriela, Vivian has her heart set on thatsuit. Why not let her take it?"


Instead of bristling, Gabriela let out a short, amused laugh. "Double? You think that's an offer? Bring me a million, and it's yours."


Vivian's mouth worked soundlessly, fury flashing in her eyes.


Her family's wealth was undeniable, but her allowance had limits. A million she could scrape together-spending it, however, would leave her nearly penniless for the rest of the month.


Gabriela arched a brow and turned to Phyllis."What's the problem? Your friend can't swing it?Maybe you can pitch in and help her out."


Phyllis's brows knit together in disapproval. "It's only that Vivian likes the suit, so why make a fuss?"


Heat climbed up Vivian's neck, her frustration making her voice sharp. "Is your life really that pathetic you have to squeeze money/out of people?"


"I'm not forcing anyone here," Gabriela countered, her tone deceptively light. "You're the one who offered double. If that's still too low for me, I've every right to push the price higher."


Then she let her voice drop to a mocking mnurmur that carried clearly through the boutique. "If you can't afford it, maybe stop pretending you belong in high society. The two of you are utterly vain."


The insult hit home. Both Vivian and Phyllis stiffened,their faces frozen in rage.


The sales assistant, hiding her amusement, passed the neatly wrapped suit to Gabriela and said pleasantly, "Miss Haynes, if it doesn't fit your boyfriend, you're welcome to bring it back for alterations."



Gabriela accepted it with a subtle, knowing smile."Thanks."



Vivian's lips curled in a sneer. "What's there to be so smug about? Spend all you want-your boyfriend might not even be yours alone." "Sounds like you're jealous." Gabriela's tone was almost playful, but her words cut clean. "My man's tall, attractive, and full of ambition. He doesn't mooch off women like certain losers. Spoiling him is my choice,and I enjoy it."


Vivian barely flinched. But Phyllis? The color drained from her face.


Dustin might have looked perfect on paper, but his modest family background was his one glaring flaw.Gabriela had never let that slide, often tossing barbs about him being a freeloader-a humiliation Phyllis couldn't stand.


She cursed Gabriela under her breath. In high school,Gabriela had been the perfect punching bag for every petty insult. When had that woman learned to biteback so sharply?


Forcing down her ire, Phyllis curved her lips into a practiced smile. "I can't wait to meet your boyfriend at my wedding,Gabriela."


At that, Vivian's mood shifted. Her irritation melted into a smug anticipation.


They'd already set the stage for some chaos-and she was eager to watch Gabriela squirm when the curtain rose.


Gabriela had barely stepped out with the suit when Vivian's voice rang out behind her, pitched just loud enough for every passerby to hear. "Phyllis,your family took her in and gave her everything without expecting a thing back. And how does she repay you? By obsessing over your boyfriend."


"Come on, don't say such things,".Phyllis muttered in a voice dripping with false concern. "She has a boyfriend ofher own."


Vivian let out a derisive laugh. "Oh, you mean that so-called secret boyfriend? Please. She probably invented him out of spite-and now she's dropping a hundred grand on a suit..."


Gabriela inhaled slowly, willing herself not to waste another ounce of breath on those two worthless scumbags. Still, one thing had to be clear before the wedding-Brenden's parade of exes was absolutely forbidden from appearing.


She was paying a hundred thousand for a pretend boyfriend. Keeping a few women from causing a scene at the wedding was hardly an unreasonable demand.



Just as the thought formed, Gabriela's phone buzzed with a message from "NotASaunders." "Take the suit to company HQ tomorrow and hand it to Mr. Moss."


Brenden's antics rarely surprised her anymore, but this one made her pause. Had he actually made peace with Wesley? And now he was bold enough to rope Wesley into running his errands?


Her thumbs moved quickly over the screen."Your exes won't be showing up at the wedding,right?"


Several minutes ticked by before his answer popped up."Rest assured."


The next morning, Gabriela tucked the suit into an elegant, ribbon-tied box and carried it to the office.


When she finally placed it in Wesley's hands, a flicker of reluctance pricked at her.


This wasn't just fabric and thread-it was over a hundred thousand dollars in silk and tailoring.


She'd never in her life bought something so extravagantly priced.


Noticing the flicker of reluctance in her gaze,Wesley's lips curved in quiet amusement.


He reached for an elegant box beside him and extended it toward her. "This is for you."


The sleek packaging betrayed nothing of what it held.


"For me?" Gabriela froze for a beat, blinking at him in surprise.


Could this unexpected present be Wesley making amends for that pitiful year-end gift?


A low chuckle rumbled from his chest."Consider it a return gift."


Her anticipation collapsed in aninstant.


A return gift from Brenden was hardly appealing to her in any way.


She accepted it with a faint smile and set it down on her desk without much thought.


"Aren't you going to open it?" Wesley urged.


"I'll check it out at home later," she replied,her voice flat.



Without another word, she moved off toward the kitchenette to make coffee.



During the process, an idea lit in her mind. Her step picked up, and she returned with the steaming cup in hand, placing it in front of Wesley. "Mr. Moss,the gifts you handed out this year were incredible.Everyone's been showing them off online, praising how generous you are."


As she spoke, Gabriela eased her sleeve back, exposing the plain bracelet at her wrist, letting it catch the light as she casually gave it a small wave.


Wesley had more money than he knew what todo with. With the right nudge, maybe he'd suddenly feel like giving her another gift.


Wesley caught the cue instantly, his gaze lingering on the simple piece. A faint smirk played at his lips as he decided to toy with her. "That bracelet really does look good on you."
###Chapter 54 Wesley Was Away On A Business Trip
Gabriela's eyes sparkled with expectation as she looked at Wesley. "Don't you think the bracelet's missing something?"


Wesley stifled a smile, his eyes dancing with quiet amusement. "Your hand is striking enough. Jewelry would only weigh it down."


Really, what kind of taste was that? Beautiful hands deserved luxurious skincare or, at the very least, a stunning watch.


He'd missed such an obvious hint. No wonder he was wealthy but still unattached.


Gabriela's spirits sank, and she tugged her sleeve down.


Shifting gears, she recalled something else. "Mr.Moss, that suit is an off-the-rack piece. Mr. Saunders should probably try it on first."


Wesley nodded."Noted."


He picked up the suit and stepped into the lounge.


When he emerged, Gabriela found herself staring,captivated for a long moment before snapping back to reality.


Wait, wasn't this suit for Brenden? Was Wesley just trying on the suit to check the fit for Brenden?


As Wesley adjusted his sleeves, he glanced at her."Do you know how to tie a necktie?"


Gabriela nodded absently.


She vaguely remembered tying a necktie for someone before.


"Come here and help me," he said.


"Yes, sir."


Still dazed, Gabriela approached him.


As she drew near, a cool, commanding presence enveloped her, his masculine aura overwhelming.


Her heart pounded uncontrollably.


Holding the tie, she noticed the top button of Wesley's white shirt was undone. Softly, she said,"Your shirt's unbuttoned."


Wesley looked down at her. "Button it for me."


His voice carried a low, husky edge, laced with an almost magnetic pull.

"Of course,Mr. Moss," she replied.

Gabriela's fingers trembled with nerves, and when they grazed his firm chest, she pulled back, her ears flushing red.


Wesley let out a soft chuckle, his Adam's apple shifting, sending her heart into a deeper flutter.

"Could you bend down a bit, Mr. Moss?"

With Wesley leaning closer, Gabriela managed to button his shirt and tie the necktie.  His usual style was cold and precise, exuding a cold,distant air.


The suit she'd chosen was classic, elegant, and refined. It might not have matched the price of his usual attire, but on him, it looked effortlessly stylish and striking.


Gabriela was entranced. "You look incredibly sharp."


The understated outfit highlighted his prominent Adam's apple, drawing her in despite herself.


Wesley was amused by her expression. "The suit's impressive."


Gabriela felt lightheaded.


Wesley's height and charm could make anything look like couture.



Only when he changed out of the suit did Gabriela recall the pressing issue.


If Wesley was just trying it on, what was the point if it fit perfectly?

 
null  Caught up in his charisma, she briefly entertained a wild idea.


Maybe she should gift the suit to him. It probably wouldn't fit Brenden anyway.


But she didn't dare say it aloud.


The rest of the day felt heavy for Gabriela as she wondered whether Wesley had delivered the suit to Brenden.


After getting home and showering, she still hadn't heard from Brenden, so she texted him. "Did you get the suit? Tried it on? Does it fit?"


"NotASaunders" replied quickly, "It fits."


Gabriela was confused. Had she misremembered?Maybe Brenden wasn't that much shorter than Wesley.


Well, if he said it fit, there was nothing more to say.


The days passed swiftly.


Three days before the holiday, Wesley had Billy contact the think tank to arrange a trip to Athea.



A critical project had hit a snag.



As Wesley's personal secretary, Gabriela packed his belongings-part of her routine duties.


"Athea's climate is humid and about ten degrees colder than here, Mr. Moss, so dress warmly. Watch your diet too. Celery's good for your heart. Try to eat some and don't be too picky."


As she folded his clothes and packed, she kept up her reminders.



Wesley leaned against the doorframe, watching her with a warm gaze.


Despite her forgetfulness, she cared enough to look out for him.



If he weren't worried about raising her suspicions,he'd have brought her to Athea. Having grown accustomed to her cooking, his tastes had grown even more selective. He looked at her, his voice low and captivating."Don't worry.I'll be back on time."


Catching his steady gaze, Gabriela realized she was fussing like a concerned spouse, overstepping her role.


She handed the two large suitcases to Billy. "Mr.Clarke, you know about Mr. Moss's heart condition,right? If there's drinking, keep it under control. Even if the project hits bumps, don't let him stress too much."



With Wesley's wealth, there was no need to risk his health over a project.


Billy smiled and nodded. "Don't worry, I'll look after Mr.Moss for you."


Gabriela frowned, puzzled.


What did Billy mean by "for you"? Wasn't it part of his job as Wesley's secretary to take care of him?


But she quickly brushed it off, following them to the parking garage to see them off. Soon,Wesley and Billy reached the airport.


The think tank members exchanged amused looks at the sight of Wesley's oversized suitcases.


Billy laughed, explaining for Wesley. "Miss Haynes packed these for Mr. Moss. Besides clothes, there are plenty of energy-boosting supplements."


The group was stunned.


It was only a few days abroad. Surely Gabriela didn't need to go all out for something like this.


Wesley cast a glance at the group and gave a helpless shrug. "What can I say? She's always fussing over my health."


The think tank members were left speechless.


It sounded suspiciously like Wesley was flaunting Gabriela's concern for him.







Even with Wesley and Billy away, under Tessa's direction, the team finished the last tasks before the The night before the holiday, Aubrey wheeled her suitcase over and said goodbye to Gabriela."Gabriela, you have to video chat with me at midnight on New Year's. Let's count down together!Ugh, I'm already missing you and the holidays haven't even started."



Gabriela smirked."Spare me the theatrics."


Besides, Aubrey would be with her boyfriend, and she probably wouldn't have time for a video call at all.



Aubrey huffed, "God, you're frigid. No wonder someone as gorgeous as you is still single!"


Gabriela saw her off at the train station, marking the start of her holiday.


With Phyllis's wedding approaching,the bride-to-be had grown uncharacteristically quiet.


But Gabriela knew her too well-silence usually meant Phyllis was plotting something. Something that, more often than not, involved setting a trap for Gabriela.
###Chapter 55 Don't You Dare Bother Me Again
The day before the wedding, just as Gabriela had expected, Phyllis flooded the classmates' group chat with a parade of photos-herself beaming in a pristine white wedding gown, a ring boasting a walnut-sized diamond glittering on her finger as she clung tightly to Dustin's hand.


It was a group of high school alumni, and Gabriela-added for reasons she stil didn't understand-had barely typed a word since joining.


If not for the constant pings announcing Phyllis's photos, she wouldn't have noticed this group chat at all.


"Congratulations! May your marriage be blissful,Phyllis."


"That wedding dress is gorgeous, Phyllis-and your fiancé is incredibly handsome."


"You two are such a heavenly pair-talented,beautiful, and made for each other."


Originally, their idle chatter had nothing to do with Gabriela-until Phyllis deliberately tagged her and slipped in a few sly jabs.


"Come to think of it, I really owe my thanks to my cousin Gabriela. Without her, I never would've met such an outstanding man like Dustin... and now, he's the love of my life."


The classmates were-confused by the message.


"Wait, your fiancé was introduced by Gabriela?"


"Phyllis, you're not concerned about Gabriela making a play for your fiancé?"


Phyllis let her words drip with insinuation. "Well,truth be told, Gabriela did have a little thing for Dustin.I mean, who wouldn't? He's got it all."


The group's chat quickly turned into a gossip frenzy. "Sounds like she's after your man, Phyllis. Better keep an eye on her."


Phyllis played the gracious act in her reply."She probably couldn't control herself. I'm fine with it,really. But Dustin might not be so at ease."


That was all it took for the others to jump in.


"Of course he's irritated. Gabriela must be bothering him nonstop-anyone would lose patience."


"Exactly. Back in high school, Gabriela was always trying to cozy up to other girls' boyfriends. Guess some habits never die."



Gabriela read each message with a blank expression.


None of it surprised her.


Phyllis had always delighted in making her life difficult-grabbing what belonged to her and even stealing the man she once cared for.


Now that Phyllis had everything she ever wanted,she still went out of her way to relentlessly provoke Gabriela.


Thankfully, Gabriela had long since let go of Dustin,her heart no longer tangled up in him.


Had she still cared, this public jab might have driven her to hide under the covers in tears. Then her swollen eyes would give Phyllis and her friends fresh amusement to gossip over at the wedding tomorrow.


Gabriela simply refused to give them the reaction they wanted, acting as if she hadn't noticed a thing.


Out of nowhere, Vivian chimed in, tagging Gabriela yet again, "Phyllis, Gabriela's been secretly longing for Dustin day after day. You're practically a saint for still thanking her and speaking kindly of her."


Vivian's dig sparked immediate agreement.


"I remember Gabriela being pretty wild back in school-ditching class just to flirt with guys."


"She's got that dangerous charm-definitely not someone with clean intentions. Phyllis, I'd watch my back if I were you." Phyllis's words breezed through the chat. "Gabriela's got a boyfriend now, so don't get the wrong idea.She even promised to bring him to my wedding. From what I've heard, he's quite a catch-sounds like she's moved on from Dustin."



Phyllis's friends were quick to pile on, tossing out snide guesses about what kind of man Gabriela could possibly land.


"Probably one of those shady gang types."


"Maybe a spoiled rich boy with a string of girlfriends waiting in line."


"You're giving her too much credit. I'm betting he's old, ugly, and she's just the side piece. Wouldn't be surprised if the real wife storms in one day to put her in her damn place. Ha!"


Gabriela stayed silent, which only fueled their cruelty.Their words grew sharper, more brazen, feeding off each other's scorn.


Back in high school, more than half the class had delighted in tearing her down.It was a long-ingrained contempt-a belief that Gabriela was born to be despised, someone anyone could walk over without consequence.


A handful of classmates who'd stayed quiet until now finally spoke up, telling the others not to cross the line.


"You've never laid eyes on Gabriela doing any of that yourself. What if it's all just false rumors?"


"Oh, please-what, are you in love with Gabriela?That's the only reason you'd defend her."


Anyone who dared take Gabriela's side was quickly drowned out, their words dismissed before they could gain any traction.


The voices left dominating the chat belonged entirely to those who loathed her, and their attacks grew even more vicious.


Disgust twisted in Gabriela's gut.


She couldn't fathom why they clung to such spite, especially when she'd never done a thing to harm them.


This time, she didn't hold back. Her fingers flew over the keyboard, each keystroke sharp with rage. "What the hell is wrong with you people? Every time you run your mouths, nothing but garbage comes out.Your heads are in the gutter, so of course you see dirt in everything around you-yet you still strut around like you're better than everyone else. Honestly, I feel sorry for your parents for raising such pathetic,worthless trash."



Without waiting for replies, she left the group entirely.


Switching to her private conversation with Phyllis,she sent her an audio clip.


"Gabriela, from what I hear, your company's crawling with single guys. They may not measure up to Dustin,but they're enough for you. Just find anyone who's halfway decent and call it a day."


Those had been Phyllis's smug words earlier, tossed out while she flashed her diamond ring-a jab meant to sting.


Without hesitation, Gabriela forwarded a video from Grace Robuchon, capturing the moment Phyllis and her friends had falsely accused her of theft.


She followed it with a short text. "Don't you dare bother me again."


Barely had the message gone through when a sharp knock sounded on her door.


Gabriela opened it to find Phyllis standing there, her expression twisted with hostility. "What the hell do you want?" she asked, her voice cool as ice.


Phyllis's glare burned with pure spite.


Gabriela's beauty had always been a thorn in Phyllis's side-a constant reminder of everything she couldn't outshine.



She had already stripped Gabriela of her home,her elegant dresses, her delicate hairpins. She had smeared her reputation beyond repair,and stolen her boyfriend. Yet the envy still burned.


Gabriela had been torn down to nothing. Yet somehow,she had clawed her way back. Why wasn't she drowning in shame, scraping by on scraps and other people's pity?


Instead, she had walked into a top-tier university,stepped into Apex Group, and landed as Wesley's secretary.


An orphan, living like she belonged to the glamorous world Phyllis could barely touch-how the hell was that possible?


And those eyes-how could they still burn so brightly?





The longer Phyllis stared, the more her rage curdled,her nails digging crescents into her palms.


"What exactly were you trying to say by sending those?" she demanded sharply.


Gabriela's gaze was steady, her voice low and dangerous. "Push me again, and I'll make sure your wedding guests get a front-row seat to the real you."


Phyllis's smile vanished, her tone turning sharp as glass. "You wouldn't dare. Remember-your dead mother only gets to rest quietly in the ground because my mother pays for her grave every year.Mess with me, and I'll see to it your late mother's peace gets ripped to shreds."


The words sliced into Gabriela's chest, freezing her breath. Her gaze darkened, voice low and unyielding."Leave me be, and I'll leave you alone. Piss me off,and we'll both go straight to hell together,you got that?"



Her mother was the one line she refused to let anyone cross. If anyone so much as brushed against that boundary, she'd strike back without hesitation-even if it meant destroying herself in the process.
###Chapter 56 Stealing The Spotlight





Phyllis faltered under the weight of Gabriela's unblinking stare, a twinge of unease threading through her simmering anger.


She had no doubt that Gabriela would make good on her threat and drag them both into hell.


"I'm perfectly happy with Dustin. We're getting married tomorrow-why on earth would I waste my time provoking you? Get over yourself," Phyllis snapped.


With that, she spun on her heel, retreating to her bedroom in a huff. She threw herself onto the bed,willing her pulse to settle.


She wanted a good night's sleep, hoping she would look breathtaking for Dustin the next day.


Once the door clicked shut behind her, Gabriela felt a heaviness settle over her. The confrontation left her utterly drained, not from fear but from years of enduring the same weary cycle.


Since high school, she'd stopped counting on Marie or Josh, clawing her way through every exam and tuition payment alone. She'd earned her degrees,carved out her career, and now stayed rooted in this place for one reason only-because she wasn't leaving without reclaiming the house that had been stolen from her.

Watching her mother's hard-built business fall into the hands of people she loathed was a humiliation Gabriela refused to swallow.


Josh might have promised to give the house back,but she knew Marie would guard it like a rabid dog.


And freeing her mother's burial plot from Marie's grasp-so her mother could truly rest-was another battle she had to win.


To accomplish all of that, she needed two things:money and the right allies. She swore to work harder than ever, chasing every opportunity until she had both.


But money took time to build, and tomorrow demanded her attention first.



The thought of Phyllis's smug little smirk made her want to show up dazzling, steal the spotlight, and watch that arrogance crack.


She'd already chosen her weapon: the gown she'd kept after attending a banquet with Wesley that night -a dress that had turned heads before, and would again.


Just as she reached for the gown to take it out for a fitting, her gaze drifted to an ornate box resting on the side table. Wesley had mentioned it earlier,saying it was a return gift from Brenden.


Though Gabriela had little interest in anything from Brenden,curiosity nudged her to lift the lid.


Inside lay a pristine white dress, paired with a necklace featuring a single ruby teardrop that glimmered faintly in the light.


A matching bracelet rested beside it, its fine craftsmanship hinting at a steep price.


The dress lacked the extravagant flair of the one from SK Elite Boutique, yet Gabriela decided to slip it on.



Its design was clean and understated, but when she saw her reflection, she was taken aback-the fabric draped over her with an effortless grace, exuding a quiet,refined luxury she hadn't expected.


Gabriela couldn't help but be impressed by Brenden's surprisingly refined taste.


Even more unexpectedly, he had remembered to prepare a thick coat for her this time.


Once she'd changed, her gaze lingered on the bracelet clasped around her wrist. After a moment's thought, she decided against wearing the new one from the gift box.


Then she composed a courteous message to "NotASaunders." "Thanks for gifting me this gorgeous dress, Mr. Saunders. The wedding begins at 5:30 PM tomorrow at the Deluxe Hotel. Can you get there on time?"


Her message vanished into the chat without a reply.


Gabriela's certainty faltered. Brenden was unpredictable at the best of times-would he even bother showing up tomorrow?


Playing it safe, she logged into a rent-a-date site,wired over a three-thousand-dollar deposit,and booked a strikingly handsome young man who seemed like a reliable choice.


After picking up a tailored suit for Brenden, she was left with barely six thousand in her account.Watching her savings dwindle by half again made her chest tighten with regret.



···


Before long, the house buzzed with noise as Josh and Marie returned, brimming with cheer while putting the final touches on the wedding preparations.


Thankfully, Gabriela had been smart enough to reserve a hotel room. She told Josh she had work to wrap up and slipped out.


Marie shother retreating figure a frosty glance and muttered, "Phyllis's wedding is tomorrow, and Gabriela can't be bothered to help at all-just how ungrateful can she be?"


Josh's thoughts drifted back to the heated fight between Gabriela and Phyllis, replaying each accusation Gabriela had thrown. He parted his lips to speak, but shut them again.


He still couldn't say who was truly in the right. It was better to keep the two of them apart than risk another blow-up.


That night, Gabriela let go of her worries and slept more peacefully than she had in days.


By the time she stired the next morning, the sunlight was already streaming across the room. Her energy felt completely renewed, the sparkle back in her eyes.


Realizing it was already noon, she rushed through her wash-up, smoothing her hair and freshening her makeup until she looked effortlessly polished.


A sudden knock broke the quiet. "Miss Haynes,the styling team you booked is here. Should I send them in?" a hotel attendant called through the door.


Gabriela blinked, momentarily thrown.


Last night, she'd chosen the cheapest single room they had-just eighty dollars a night.


Yet somehow, the staff had upgraded her to the penthouse suite, claiming the first ten new guests each day received complimentary premium service.


She had thought it odd at the time, but now the situation felt downright suspicious.


When the stylists swept inside, arms laden with cases of cosmetics, the scene felt almost unreal. They were the very team responsible for Claire-the reigning goddess of the entertainment industry.


At their head stood Annie Wright, her warm smile lighting up the room. "Well, Miss Haynes... looks like fate's brought us together again."


After exchanging pleasantries, Gabriela let Annie and her team get to work, still a little dazed by the turn of events.



For more than two hours, the stylists moved around her in a flurry of quiet efficiency before finally helping her into the white gown and fastening the ruby pendant at her throat.


Under the soft lighting, she looked even more breathtaking than she had on the night of the banquet, and Annie couldn't help showering her wvith praise.


When it came time to slip on the matching bracelet,Gabriela shook her head.


Annie tilted her head, curiosity flickering in her eyes Gabriela brushed it off with a flimsy excuse."I'll have a coat on anyway, so no one will even see the bracelet."



She certainly couldn't admit that she didn't want to take off the plain, unassuming bracelet already on her wrist.


Annie let the matter drop. "WVell, there's a natural elegance to your wrists. This bracelet may be simple,but on you, it looks effortlessly stylish."


The compliment warmed Gabriela more than she expected.


She'd been faintly annoyed that Wesley's year-end gift had been nothing more than an unremarkable bracelet, yet hearing genuine admiration for it stirred an unexpected flicker of joy.


Annie kept her own observation to herself-that the ruby pendant at Gabriela's throat was worth millions and would outshine everything in the room.


Whether or not Gabriela wore the bracelet was irrelevant.



Once the makeover was done, Gabriela saw the team off,headed downstairs for a quick meal, and pulled out her phone to message Brenden, asking when he'd be there.


His reply still hadn't come, yet an unexpected calm settled over her.


If he had arranged for the styling team to be here,he surely would show up.


And even if he wouldn't, she had a contingency ready.


Her hair was styled into a chic, effortless updo that lent a fresh, youthful air to her poised elegance.


The moment she stepped out of the car, a ripple of surprise passed through the onlookers-several failed to recognize her at first and leaned toward one another in hushed speculation.


"Who is she? She's breathtakingly gorgeous. Did the Haynes family hire a celebrity guest?" "No clue. We'll find out soon enough."


Without so much as a glance at the murmuring crowd, Gabriela glided toward the entrance of the Deluxe Hotel.


Josh had taken over the entire venue, and a gleaming row of luxury cars lined the driveway.


By the doors stood a towering wedding portrait of Phyllis and Dustin.


The couple were stationed at the entrance, smiling as they welcomed arriving guests.


But the moment Gabriela neared, Dustin's eyes locked on her, and his confident grin faltered,the smugness slipping from his face.

###Chapter 57 Gabriela's Boyfriend Is A Playboy
Dustin gazed at Gabriela, momentarily transfixed.


Her radiance was undeniable, commanding attention from every angle.


He took an instinctive step forward, her name nearly escaping his lips.


Phyllis's expression darkened instantly. She hissed through clenched teeth, "Dustin."


Hearing his fiancée call his name brought him back to reality. He quickly donned a polished smile."Welcome,Gabriela."


Clad in a tailored white suit that accentuated his lean physique, Dustin looked strikingly handsome.


Yet the intensity in his eyes was unsettling, almost nauseating. Gabriela maintained a composed expression."Wishing you both a lifetime of joy," she said evenly.


In her mind, those two were better off bound to each other.


She offered a perfunctory gift and went inside.


Dustin's eyes lingered on her retreating form for a long moment.


Phyllis's fists tightened, her resentment simmering.


Gabriela's entire look was surely calculated to command attention at her wedding.


Unconcerned with their opinions, Gabriela started looking for Josh to offer her congratulations.


Josh and Marie were occupied with greeting guests,as were Dustin's parents.


Dustin's mother, Doris Owen, elated that her son was marrying into wealth, beamed uncontrollably.


Spotting Gabriela, she deliberately looked away,letting out a sharp, dismissive snort, as if her  presence might taint the occasion.


Dustin's father, Simeon Owen, a kind-hearted man,wanted to approach Gabriela, but Doris's quick pinch on his arm stopped him cold.


Doris knew Marie disapproved of Gabriela. With a calculating glance, she approached Marie, her smile overly warm. "Isn't that the girl you raised? Arriving so late?"



Marie cast a cool glance at Gabriela. "She and Phyllis don't get along. It's enough that she showed up."


The society women around Marie exchanged surprised glances.


"I heard her mother died when she was eight, and your family took her in for over a decade. She seems rather distant, doesn't she?"


Marie sighed, feigning regret. "My husband's sister entrusted her to us before passing. I'm not her mother, so l hesitated to discipline her too firmly.That's why she's grown so headstrong and bitter.

 haven'tfulfilled my duty."


Phyllis, raised in opulence, still carried a trace of nouveau-riche flair.Marie, on the other hand, led the Haynes Group with the commanding presence of a seasoned businesswoman, earning admiration in elite circles.


Her resigned demeanor lent credibility to her words,and those women readily deemed Gabriela ungrateful.


Initially charmed by Gabriela's beauty and considering an introduction, one·of them now had second thoughts.


She hadn't realized that Gabriela's beauty was only a veneer over a flawed character.


She sighed. "It seems Gabriela's ungrateful. It's commendable your family honors its promises and hasn't cast her out."


Marie said nothing further, quietly endorsing the sentiment. Soon, the women in the group had silently labeled Gabriela as deplorable.


Gabriela finally located Josh.


His face brightened at the sight of her. "You look absolutely stunning today, Gabriela."


She exchanged a few words with him before settling into a corner seat.


She hadn't intended to stir trouble, but Vivian approached with a group of young ladies, closing in swiftly.


"You actually showed up, Gabriela? Haven't you humiliated yourself enough?"


"Phyllis overlooked your relentless pursuit of her fiancé. Have some dignity, please."


"Look at your outfit today-so extravagant. Trying to outshine Phyllis on her big day?"


Most guests had arrived. Phyllis and Dustin entered as the final jab landed. Phyllis's lips curved into a  subtle, satisfied smile, her earlier irritation easing.


Dustin kept his distance, but his eyes repeatedly drifted to Gabriela, his thoughts inscrutable.


Phyllis paused, then pulled Josh toward Gabriela.


With feigned concern, she asked, "Where's your boyfriend, Gabriela? Didn't you say he'd definitely be here? The banquet's about to start."


Josh, caught up in the event, had forgotten. Now reminded, he looked at Gabriela expectantly.


"He'll arrive soon," Gabriela replied calmly.


"How soon is 'soon'?" Vivian sneered. "Don't tell me your boyfriend's stuck working overtime? Most reputable companies are off today. Or is he in some low-end service job?"


A giggle rippled through the group.


Another woman chimed in loudly, "She probably doesn't even have a boyfriend-just making that up."


Laughter spread among them. "I'll text him," Gabriela said, unfazed.


"Texting's slow," Vivian taunted. "Lucky for you, his girlfriend's right here. Why not ask her? That'd be quicker."


Gabriela's heart sank. Before she could respond, a short-haired woman in a pink gown stepped forward,eyeing her with open hostility. "With a face like that,it's no wonder my boyfriend fell for you."


Gabriela's brow furrowed. The woman pressed on,"So, what number are you on Brenden's list of girlfriends?"


Gabriela recalled Wesley mentioning Brenden was dating his forty-first girlfriend. So she was supposedly number forty-two? Better to deny knowing Brenden entirely.


As she considered this, a familiar voice called out,"Renee,am I late?"


Gabriela's unease deepened. She turned to see Brenden. Dressed in a sharp dark blue suit, his confident stride and striking features drew attention despite his modest height.


Renee Nielsen linked her arm with his, pouting playfully. "Honey, why are you so late?"


Brenden tapped her nose with affection. "Traffic held me up, sweetheart. Don't be upset."


Gabriela's heart dropped.


She had prepared two plans: if Brenden didn't show,she'd use a stand-in from a rent-a-date service.



But she hadn't anticipated the worst-case scenario unfolding: Brenden and his girlfriend both showing up.


In an instant, she resolved never to admit knowing Brenden.


Renee, however, had no intention of letting her off easily.


She turned to Brenden and complained, "Honey, this woman claims you're her boyfriend and promised to attend the wedding with her."


The nearby women erupted into loud, uunrestrained laughter.


"Hilarious! Gabriela's boyfriend is a playboy with countless girlfriends. Place your bets-what's her number?"


"Does it matter? At least someone's willing to take her."
###Chapter 58 Sorry, I'm Late





Brenden's head snapped toward Gabriela, his expression a mix of surprise and mild confusion."Gabriela? What are you even doing here? And since when am I your boyfriend?"


Her carefully crafted plan to act as though they were strangers unraveled in an instant.


The crowd erupted with sharper, mocking laughter.


"So she's not his girlfriend at all--just a backup option.How pitiful."


"Gabriela, what the hell happened to you? Where's your self-respect?"


Phyllis lingered at the edge of the chaos, watching Gabriela stand alone under the jeers.


A slow, satisfied smile curved her lips-she relished every second of seeing Gabriela too humiliated to lift her head.


Gabriela couldn't care less about their snide remarks.She'd already endured a tidal wave of malice back in high school and come out standing.


But then she noticed Josh watching her.


His eyes were rimmed red, glistening like he was on the verge of tears.


That was the one thing she could never face without flinching-Josh crying. With his fragile heart,she feared even the smallest upset might push him too far.



A slow burn of irritation welled up inside her.


Brenden had really outdone himself-choosing the exact wrong time to disappoint her.


Josh stepped forward, gripping her arm with trembling fingers, his voice rough with hurt. "Didn't you tell me you'd found yourself a great boyfriend?How could he turn out to be some womanizing playboy? You declined to attend the blind date, saying you were already seeing someone. Was all of that just a lie? How could you fool me like this?"


The pointed questions from Josh only deepened the crowd's contempt, their eyes narrowing on Gabriela as if she were beneath them.


Brenden, still trying to process why a middle-aged man was breaking down in front of him, felt an odd twist of unease.


That was the moment it dawned on him-he might have made a mistake.


Catching the brittle curve of Gabriela's smile and the way her expression trembled with wounded pride, he guessed that dismissing her so publicly must have stung.


A flicker of guilt crossed his features. "I'm sorry,Gabriela. I really didn't realize you were..."


He didn't get as far as the last words-"so taken with me."



Before the awkward pause could settle, Vivian's friend leaned in, her tone sharp with warning. "Mr.Saunders, back in high school, Gabriela was a wild one-always running with the wrong crowd. You'd better watch she doesn't cling to you."
Judging by Gabriela's usual behavior, Brenden knew that accusation was bullshit and cut in, his voice firm,"She's not that kind of person..."
The cheerful buzz in the room abruptly died, every head swiveling toward the hotel entrance.
Even the group encircling Gabriela broke off, their eyes drawn to the commotion.
Vivian craned her neck, curiosity piqued. "Who's that? Why's everyone heading over?"
"Not sure. Looks like a VIP just showed up."
A spark of excitement lit Vivian's eyes.
She recalled offhandedly telling her brother a few days ago that she wanted him at the wedding.
If he really had come, his business clout would have half theroom fawning over her for introductions.


Shoving her way through the guests, she hurried toward the entrance.


At that moment, Gabriela'sphone vibrated with a short,almost terse text. "I'm here."


It was none other than Wesley who sent the message.


She blinked, momentarily thrown. What exactly did he mean by that?


On instinct, she lifted her head toward the doors,trying to catch a glimpse, but the entrance was packed-a restless tide of bodies blocking her view.


She began pushing forward, intent on confirming her suspicion.


Before she could break through the crowd, Josh seized her arm. His eyes brimmed with tears, his voice shaking as he demanded, "Don't you dare dodge me, Gabriela. Tell me the truth-do you not have a boyfriend at all? How could you lie to me?"
Tears streamed down his face in an unending torrent,soaking his cheeks until they glistened.


Gabriela stood frozen, unsure how to comfort him.


All she could do was speak gently, her voice low and steady. "Vivian and her friends have it out for me.They dragged Brenden here just to humiliate me.I swear I have a boyfriend-I'm not making this up.Please, Uncle Josh, stop crying... people are staring."


But he seemed beyond caring, completely consumed by grief, his sobs shaking his shoulders.


At this rate, if she didn't present a boyfriend soon,she feared his tears might break her before they stopped.







Outside the hotel, Wesley finished tapping out a message just as Billy stepped forward to open the car door. He waited in silence, posture straight, while two rows of towering men in sharp black suits flanked the entrance, holding back the curious crowd pressing for a better look.


The air felt charged, almost oppressive, as if the entire lobby were holding its breath.


Wesley stepped out of the car in a dark-gray classic suit that exuded quiet authority, instantly drawing every gaze his way.


Marie marched right toward him, only to halt when a wall of stone-faced bodyguards blocked her path.


Without slowing, Wesley strode into the hotel, his polished shoes clicking against the marble floor.


Recognition rippled through the crowd. "That's Mr.Moss from Apex Group,isn't it?"


"It is!"



"My God, what on earth is he doing here? The Haynes family actually got him to show up? I didn't know they had that kind of pull."


"Think it's Phyllis's doing, or maybe Dustin's connections?" "Come on-let's edge closer. Once those bodyguards ease up, it'll be the perfect time to greet Mr.Moss and make an impression."


Escorted by his black-suited entourage, Wesley cut a direct path to Gabriela. "Sorry, I'm late."


he remarked, his voice a low, velvety rumble. His expression stayed coolly composed, yet his gaze on her was unmistakably warm.


Josh still clung to Gabriela's hand as she tried in vain to calm him.



Then, out of nowhere, the impossibly polished Wesley stood before her in the very suit she had chosen for Brenden. She froze, breath catching in her throat.



Catching the distant look in her eyes, Wesley's brows drew together as he queried, "Why are you just standing there? Come here already!"


The shock of seeing him here left her momentarily speechless. Whatever had brought him, gratitude swelled in her chest. His poised, unshakable presence was like a lifeline she hadn't known she needed until now.


She drifted over, still looking a touch bewildered,and murmured, "What brings you here, Mr. Moss?"


Somehow, his expression seemed to shadow instantly at the question.


Gabriela swallowed whatever she'd been about to say and simply remained at his side, quiet and still.


Josh's tears had finally dried, leaving him staring at Wesley as if he couldn't quite believe his eyes.


That was Gabriela's boss. Why would he attend this wedding when they hadn't sent him an invitation at all? Could it be possible that he was Gabriela's boyfriend?


A grin broke through Josh's stunned expression, and he strode forward, voice bright with relief. "Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Moss. So you're Gabriela's boyfriend? Now I get why she kept you away from the family."


Wesley inclined his head in a curt nod that served as a greeting.


Then he turned to Gabriela, one brow arching."What's this-am I someone you need to keep hidden away?"


Gabriela was taken by surprise by his question.


Was Wesley leaning a little too hard into the role?Well,she decided to roll with the act.


With a coy smile, she stepped closer, her voice low and teasing. "When you're this incredible, of coursel need to keep you a secret."


His lips curved in quiet approval. "Wise choice."


The other guests who heard their playful banter were at a loss for words.


A neat wall of bodyguards cut the space in two,leaving Wesley and Gabriela standing alone in the cleared center as if the rest of the guests had ceased to exist.



On both sides, people strained to see past the human barrier, their curiosity burning.


Every gaze was fixed on Gabriela now, the sudden star of the evening.


Across the room, Phyllis's smile had soured, her complexion turning an envious shade.
###Chapter 59 A Little Too Taken With Him

Phyllis wasn't the only one with a sour expression.


Vivian, in particular, lost all color in an instant.


Wesley was Gabriela's boyfriend? The thought made her stomach drop. How could that even be true?


Yet the memory of those suffocating three days in detention crept back in, and suddenly it all fit together.


If there'd been nothing between them, why else would Wesley have gone out of his way to shield a mere employee?


Her pulse kicked up, unease tightening in her chest.If her brother caught wind of today's events, she was bound to get another scolding.


Around her, her friends were buzzing with barely contained astonishment.



"That's really Wesley Moss, isn't it? I've only seen him in interviews-he's even better-looking in person."


"Come on-him and Gabriela? No way. They have to be faking this!"


"No way! He's all about staying low-key and keeps his distance from women. What kind of pull could Gabriela possibly have to get him to play along?"


"We were just circling Gabriela, mocking her and trying to humiliate her. Damn, we're in trouble."


One by one, their bravado cracked. Each replayed the snide remarks they'd tossed out, wondering if they'd gone too far-and whether Gabriela might decide to make them pay for it.



A few attributed the slight toward Gabriela to Vivian's influence. If it hadn't been for helping her seek retribution, none of them would've gone after Gabriela in the first place. Vivian's chest tightened with a mix of fear and loathing.



Her brother had once told her that the Crownridge Group-owned by the Moss family-was a multinational powerhouse, holding the number two spot in global revenue for nine consecutive years.


The Moss family's fortune was vast beyond measure,but its family tree was a snarl of rivalries, the infighting cutthroat.


Wesley had steered clear of that mess, refusing to be pulled into the feud. Instead, he'd built his own empire from the ground up, and in just a few short years,he had carved out a place among the elite. He even had an office tower bearing his company's name.


Plenty of young blood in the Moss family had brains and ambition, but Wesley was the only one his grandfather had openly acknowledged as the future heir.



If nothing went wrong, he would become the head of the Moss family.



The more Vivian dwelled on it, the sharper her envy became.



Out of everyone in the world, it had to be Gabriela who caught Wesley's attention? The whole thing was downright insane.



Soon,the banquet started.


Josh was the only one the bodyguards didn't turn away. With his usual cheer, he remarked, "Mr. Moss,Gabriela, don't just hover there-sit down, have a bite, and let's talk."


The sight of the guests penned in behind a wall of black suits wasn't exactly flattering.



For Josh's sake, Gabriela gave Wesley's sleeve a light, almost pleading tug.



Seeing that she was wearing the bracelet he had given her, he let a faint softness creep into his expression. A silent look passed from him to Billy.


Billy replied with a subtle nod and signaled for the bodyguards to ease back.


Across the room, Vivian's fingers shook even harder.


Gabriela held this much sway? If she complained to Wesley, Vivian suspected her brother wouldn't just scold her-he might keep her locked at home for half a year.


Spotting an opening, Marie swept in with a bright,obsequious smile, angling to guide Wesley toward the head table.



But he dismissed her smoothly, his voice even. "I've got an urgent issue to handle, so I won't bejoining you at the table."


The edges of Marie's smile stiffened, threatening to crack.



He'd clearly come solely for Gabriela-and now he was about to walk right back out without even bothering to wait for the wedding ceremony to finish. It was as good as slapping Phyllis in the face in front of all the guests.


If Phyllis became the object of mockery,how would she salvage her reputation, let alone conduct business later?


Marie flicked several meaningful glances at Josh,silently urging him to pressure Gabriela into doing something.


But Josh, oblivious as ever, squinted at her instead."What's with your eyes, Marie? Haven't been sleeping enough these last two days?"


Her chest tightened in frustration, words lodging in her throat.



Once, she had relished how readily Josh bent to her will, eager to accept whatever she handed him.


Now, his cluelessness left her feeling utterly exasperated.


Wesley paid them no mind, resting a light hand on the crown of Gabriela's head. "Something's come up.
 Come with me and we'll deal with it."


Gabriela found her eyes fixed on his hand and felt her pulse skip.


Almost without thinking, she nodded, dazed, a faint warmth spreading through her chest.


Oh my God! He was distractingly good-looking...and maybe she was just a little too taken with him.


His tone gentled even further as he went on, "Let your uncle know first. I'll be waiting outside."


Even with urgency tugging at him,Wesley was giving her every courtesy-bringing her along, yet allowing her the dignity of a proper farewell to her family.


A warm surge of confidence swelled inside her.


Once again, Wesley had stepped in without hesitation, the steady safety net always there when she needed it.


She marveled at how fate had been so generous,placing her in the hands of a boss like him. After murmuring an apology to Josh, she broke into a light jog to catch up with Wesley-only for a man to suddenly block her path. "Excuse me, are you Ms.Gabriela Haynes?"


Blinking in surprise, she found herself facing a sharply dressed man in his late thirties. The black suit fit him to perfection, his square jaw and upright stance giving him a commanding presence.


Like the think tank specialists who often flanked Wesley, he radiated a polished, high-society refinement from head to toe.



Yet Gabriela was certain she had never seen him before.


"Sorry," she replied politely, her tone cool but courteous. "I think you might have the wrong person."



Erik Mckay's brows lifted slightly, as if her blank look caught him off guard.


A man who prided himself on never forgetting a face, he was confident he was speaking to the right person.


"I'm with Williams Group, overseeing our software development," he swiftly explained. "We've got a smart braille program nearly ready for launch. You were the one who set it in motion-don't you remember?"



"I'm afraid you've got the wrong person, sir."Gabriela lingered for a beat, searching her memory,then gave a small, decisive shake of her head. "Sorry -someone's waiting for me. I have to go."


She brushed past him without another glance,ignoring the flicker of confusion that crossed his face.


Her steps quickened until she reached Wesley,who had been watching the exchange with a measured calm. As she drew closer, his voice carried a casual edge. "So... how exactly do you know someone from Williams Group?"


Gabriela tilted her head, brows knitting in mild puzzlement. "Must be some mix-up. I've never met him."


Her wide, luminous eyes only grew more guileless when she blinked and let them widen ever so slightly,the picture of sincerity.


It really seemed like she was telling the truth.


Wesley studied her a beat longer, then gavea short nod."Get in the car."


Billy, trailing just behind, kept his observations to himself.


He'd crossed paths with the Williams Group before and knew their inner circle well.


Erik, the CEO's right-hand man, was razor-sharp and far too discerning to confuse Gabriela with anyone else-especially when her features were this utterly striking.


Since Billy would dig into it later, Wesley saw no need to dwell on the encounter. He stepped forward and pulled open the driver's side door.


Noting that he intended to drive personally, Gabriela slipped into the passenger seat without hesitation,the movement smooth and swift.



The sight drew more than a few startled glances from onlookers-it was hard to miss the quiet tenderness in his gesture.


Billy blocked Brenden from following them and then slid into another car with a couple of bodyguards.


Gabriela fastened her seatbelt in silence, resisting the urge to ask where they were going. Wherever Wesley led, she was prepared to go.


His lips curved in a faint, knowing smile as the engine turned over, and the car eased away
###Chapter 60 Turning Him Down





Wesley's car offered generous space, yet the air inside seemed saturated with his presence-an unshakable, magnetic force that pressed in on Gabriela until it was almost stifling.


She sat quietly for a long while before she finally gathered the nerve to murmur, "Thanks for stepping in earlier, Mr.Moss."


Her tone was soft, her posture modest, which earned her a quiet, low chuckle from him. "And what exactly am I being thanked for?" he asked, a trace of amusement curling at the edge of his voice.


"For pretending to be my... boyfriend," she admitted.


Without his intervention, she would have been left defenseless against Josh's emotional outburst.


She could only bring herself to utter "boyfriend" in a voice full of courtesy and sincerity. Wesley slid her a sidelong glance, the motion slow and deliberate, before giving the faintest nod. His profile, carved in the cool light, carried an imposing elegance that made him seem even more unreachable.


Gabriela couldn't quite put her finger on why his mood had darkened so abruptly, and the shift left her slightly on edge.


Still, she ventured with quiet concern, "Weren't you and Mr. Clarke supposed to be in Athea for a project?"



"Just stepped off the plane hours ago," Wesley said.


What he didn't mention was how he'd crammed his schedule into an exhausting blur just to shave a day off the trip-enduring Billy's complaints and the think tank's protests the entire time.


The instant he touched down, he'd swapped into the tailored suit she'd picked for him, headed straight to the Deluxe Hotel, and let everyone see, without question, that she was his girlfriend.


Earn gift cards Yet even with that unspoken declaration, the little fool still clung to formality.


Catching the faint weariness in his eyes made Gabriela's chest tighten with an unfamiliar ache. She wasn't meant to have felt that way-not given her place-but she did.


When her gaze slid toward him again, she realized her coat and his suit were almost a perfect match, as if they'd dressed for each other without knowing it.


A sharp breath snagged in her throat.


The gown she'd worn to the wedding, the one she'd thought was a casual favor from Brenden, had actually been handed to her by Wesley himself.Maybe it had never been Brenden's gift at all.


She opened her mouth to ask, but the car eased to a stop before she could speak. "Get out," Wesley said,his voice low but firm.


Stepping onto the pavement, Gabriela blinked in surprise at the stretch of open sea before them. "Why bring me here?" she asked, curiosity threading her tone.



Wesley's gaze dropped to meet hers.


He had spent years moving through glittering circles,surrounded by elegant women draped in designer gowns. Yet he couldn't ignore how Gabriela stood apart-her beauty sharpened by those clear,luminous eyes that held no pretense.



A salty breeze teased at the hem of her skirt,sending it swaying, and her faintly furrowed brows gave her an almost childlike innocence that tugged at something deep in his chest.



This was the woman he had set his heart on.


He took a step toward her, but the sky dimmed and a fine drizzle began to fall, the air turning crisp in an instant.



Gabriela, who moments ago had been stiff with nerves, brightened suddenly. "I'lI get the umbrella!"she blurted, her voice laced with purpose. Ever since she'd become his personal secretary,she'd made it a habit to stash an umbrella in the trunk of his car. She only hoped no one had taken it out.


Hurrying over, she popped the trunk. Relief washed over her-the umbrella was still there.


She returned to Wesley, the handle gripped firmly in her hand. Rising on tiptoe, she tilted it over his head,her gaze lifting to meet his as the rain whispered down around them.



The wind roared in from the sea, nearly yanking the umbrella from her grasp, but Gabriela tightened her hold, determined to shield Wesley from the pelting rain.



She might have looked delicate, yet she stood braced against the storm, refusing to yield an inch.


Wesley reached over, taking the handle from her while his other hand slipped around her right arm,steadying her against the wind. He wore no cologne, yet as he leaned in, she caught a fresh, clean scent from him-cool, yet threaded with an unshakable authority that made her pulse jump. Heat rushed to her cheeks.


"M-Mr. Moss... let me do it," she stammered,clutching for the handle again.


A boss who paid her such a generous salary wasn't supposed to be the one holding the umbrella over her head.



"Why are you shaking?" Wesley's brows drew together, his voice carrying a husky edge. "Come here. Don't let the rain soak you."


Gabriela instinctively lifted her gaze and was caught by the unwavering intensity in his eyes.


Something about this felt wrong.


She was just his secretary-yet he'd rushed straight from the airport to the hotel to stand up for her. And now...he was holding her.


Out of nowhere, Aubrey's playful voice echoed in her  mind. "Mr. Moss came to your rescue and drove you home-was there a little chemistry?"


Gabriela had once laughed off Aubrey's wild talk about the boss, dismissing it as nothing more than idle nonsense.


But now, even she felt a reckless spark of curiosity-could Wesley actually be interested in her?


Heat flared in her cheeks as she buried her face in her hands, her pulse thudding against her palms. The flutter in her chest could have been excitement, yet a heavy,aching sadness curled beneath it.


Wesley was not just handsome-he was striking, with the kind of effortless elegance and staggering wealth that made him seem untouchable. He had always been her crush. And if by some impossible chance he liked her in return, she could imagine herself agreeing before he even finished the question,nodding until she was dizzy.


But the thought of saying yes came tangled with dread. Because the moment she dared step closer to Wesley, she knew Brenden would find out-and that discovery could shatter everything.


Word was, Brenden was Wesley's cousin-and nothing thrilled him more than ratting someone out.She knew he'd have no trouble turning her in.



If he found out about her on-nightstand with Brendan, would he think she'd been two-timing him?



That would be the end of her career.



Absolutely not. She couldn't afford to lose her job.


Across from her, Wesley watched her face cycle through surprise, worry, and defiance, clearly amused by the constant flicker of emotion.


Maybe he didn't love her wvith the depth of a lifelong passion, but for years she'd been the one who mattered most to him. Her presence coaxed smiles from him without effort.



He was willing to have her stay by his side forever. In his head, a sharp whisper demanded, "Now's the time-tell her!"


What he didn't realize was that, in the span of seconds, her mind had veered from romantic fantasy to cold, practical considerations about her career.


He drew a breath, squared his shoulders, and said,"Gabriela, I think you're extraordinary. Would you be willing..."


Her lungs caught, and in the boldest rush of words she'd ever managed, she cut in. "I'm sorry!"


The emotion still blazing in Wesley's eyes dimmed with stunned disbelief, the edges reddened as if the shock itself had scalded him.



Gabriela studied Wesley's face with cautious precision, trying to read the flickers of his expression.


This was the CEO of the Apex Group-wealth, status,and authority wrapped in one man-and she had just turned him down. Desperate to soften the blow, she blurted the first excuse that popped into her head, "I've always wanted a boyfriend I could look straight in the eye.You're...far too tall for my taste."


Her words stopped him cold.


Even she felt the jolt of shock as they left herlips.


She hadn't just turned him down-she'd picked him apart,piece by piece.


Damn. She was done-had to kiss that job goodbye.


The uneasy silence was broken by a sudden volley of fireworks bursting in the distance.


Brilliant blooms splashed across the dark sky,unfurling into shimmering heart shapes before fading into the drizzle.


Beneath the umbrella, both of them glanced up in faint surprise.


Gabriela's gaze lingered on the vibrant display, her thoughts a tangled knot of wonder and restraint. Seaside air, rain-slick night, and heart-shaped fireworks-by all rights, it was the perfect setting for romance.


Yet in her mind, the steady hum of a paycheck still rang sweeter.


After all, no matter how beautiful the moment,fireworks couldn't pay the rent or fill the fridge.


While Gabriela was still caught in that flicker of regret, a figure emerged from the far edge of the dimly lit boardwalk-Billy, cradling a lush bouquet in his arms like a precious offering.


As Wesley's ever-resourceful assistant, Billy took pride in staying two steps ahead of his boss's needs.


And today, the moment Wesley's feet touched home soil, he had gone straight for Gabriela, his purpose written plainly/in every move.


Billy,sharp enough to catch the unspoken, had made sure fireworks were set to blaze the sky and flowers were ready to seal the moment. With such flawless foresight, surely he deserved a generous bonus.


He pictured it already-Wesley's curt but approving nod, maybe even the faint curl of a smile. Feeling rather pleased with himself, Billy advanced toward them at an easy pace, bouquet poised in both hands.


He was just drawing a breath to present it when Wesley's gaze cut to him-cold, razor-sharp, and merciless. The look hit him like a bucket of ice water,prickling his skin and freezing his steps mid-stride.
###Chapter 61 Fireworks And Roses Are A Total Cliché


Billy's hands shook with unease. Could he have gotten it all wrong?


Was it possible that Wesley didn't harbor any romantic feelings for Gabriela?


If that were true, then what explained his relentless push in Athea these last few days?


For a long beat, Billy hovered in doubt, uncertain whether to pass the boutique over to Wesley.


By this point, any trace of tension had long drained from Wesley's face.


As the CEO of Apex Group, he wasn't the kind of man to crack under embarrassment over something as insignificant as a failed love confession.


Composure was second nature to him, and now was to steer things toward a calmer, more sustainable footing between them.


Burying every flicker of emotion behind a cool gaze,he addressed Gabriela evenly. "I think you've got the wrong idea. Women like you don't interest me in the least. The only reason I brought you here..."


Gabriela held her breath, mortified by her blunder, as Wesley continued in a flat and mechanical tone,"Was to ask if you wanted to hang around and watch Billy propose to his girlfriend."


Billy, who had been single for years, went rigid,caught completely off guard.


Most of his adult life had been swallowed by the relentless grind of working for Wesley-through crises, tight deadlines, and endless business trips-leaving little time to even think about dating.


And now, how on earth was he supposed to conjure up a girlfriend out of nowhere?


Gabriela's shoulders loosened as a faint sigh of relief slipped out. But her surprise quickly shifted to incredulous amusement.


Seriously? Wesley cared about something like this?


Apparently, even the most imposing man had a taste for juicy gossip.


The moment she turned, her gaze caught Billy with an enormous bouquet of red roses.


Honestly, watching a live proposal was far more entertaining than scrolling through some over-the-top drama series.


Billy, looking like a man headed for the gallows,darted a glance at Wesley-only to be met with an icy stare that all but said, "Want me to assign you to a nightmare project with Brenden?"


The implied threat made his knees wobble, but Billy swallowed hard and forced himself to address Gabriela. "Well, what a pleasant surprise to see you here, Miss Haynes. So...do you think I have any shot at pulling this proposal off?"  Gabriela knew him as a relentless workaholic, a man who married deadlines instead of romance. Yet today, he was suddenly playing the part of a lovestruck man.



She flashed him a quick, encouraging fist bump."You've got this. Go knock her off her feet."


"Appreciate it."


Squaring his shoulders, Billy turned toward the distance with exaggerated drama, as if his girlfriend might appear at any moment, stepping right into his carefully staged scene.


Half an hour later, drizzle clung to his hair and soaked through his jacket, leaving him shivering.


Gabriela's playful curiosity faded, replaced by quiet sympathy.


Poor guy-after all that careful preparation, his girlfriend hadn't even shown. Had she actually stood him up?


Billy risked a sideways glance toward them, no doubt  checking if Wesley's anger had simmered down.


Catching his disheartened expression, Gabriela felt a twinge of sympathy and offered gently, "Don't let it get to you, Mr. Clarke. Maybe the rain's what kept her away. You're good-looking and have a solid paycheck. A lot of the women at work think you're a catch."



Wesley's expression, however, only grew a shade darker.


Billy stiffened under Wesley's cold, cutting stare.


Her attempt at cheer only deepened the slump in his shoulders.



Picking up on it, Gabriela pressed on, her voice light but teasing. "Sure, fireworks and roses are sweet,but they're also a total cliché. You'd make a bigger impression by sliding her an unlimited credit card and telling her to use it however she wants."


The absurdity hit her a beat later, and she waved her hands in quick retreat. "Alright, maybe that would just blow the whole thing up and make her angrier.Honestly, the real problem is you don't even have a ring. Show up with one next time, and she won't be able to turn you down."



Her words instantly soured Wesley's mood, as those things she mentioned should have been prepared,yet he hadn't arranged any of them at all.


His expression tightened, and with a sharp tug at his tie,he pivoted and strode away.


Gabriela leaned toward Billy, murmuring a quick word of encouragement, then quickened her pace to catch up with Wesley.


He threw her a sidelong glance as he pressed."What's this-planning to come home with me?"


She gave a small shake of her head.


Something in his clipped tone told her he was in a foul mood.



Was it possible the deal in Athea had fallen through? Trying to be a thoughtful subordinate, Gabriela held back from trailing after him, not wanting to push his temper any further.


Wesley had gone only a few strides when the absence of footsteps made him glance over his shoulder.



She lingered in place, eyes wide and uncertain, like a stray kitten left out in the rain.


Something in him eased at the sight.


His unmet desire wasn't her burden to bear. What sense was there in taking out his frustration on her for that?


Suppressing a sigh, he said, "I'll take you home fist."


In a hesitant whisper, Gabriela inquired, "What about Mr. Clarke? Shouldn't webring him along?"


The cold bit through the air, and the rain was falling harder by the minute. She doubted Billy's girlfriend would ever appear.  Wesley let out a dry snort. "He's still waiting on his girlfriend. Planning to stick around and wait with him?"



Billy quickly cut in, "Miss Haynes, you should go ahead with Mr. Moss. I'll wait here a little longer."


Though he knew his so-called girlfriend would never show up because she didn't exist at all, he had to maintain the facade.







The drive back to Rosemont Gardens passed in heavy, unbroken silence.



When they arrived, Gabriela found the door locked,and repeated calls to Josh went unanswered.


The wedding was probably still underway, and Josh was no doubt occupied.



Wesley's brows drew together as he watched her make call after call with no answer. "You don't have a key?" She actually lived here without one?


Did she often end up stranded like this?


"It's usually Ken who lets me in, but he's helping at the hotel right now," Gabriela murmured.


Turning away, she felt a small wave of gloom settle over her. It looked like she'd be paying for another hotel room.


She pivoted too quickly, frustration tugging at her focus, and her heel slipped.


Wesley caught her before she fell, but the left heel of her shoe snapped, sending a sharp twist through her ankle.



A soft cry escaped before she could stifle it.


Though a flicker of concern crossed his mind,he masked it, keeping his voice even. "What happened?"


Gabriela tilted her face up, forcing a faint smile. "It's nothing." She'd already made a fool of herself earlier-no way was she letting him think she was so hopeless she could injure herself just walking.


All of a sudden, Wesley bent down and scooped her into his arms in one smooth motion.



Her feet left the ground so suddenly that instinct had her looping her arms around his neck.


"I can walk by myself, Mr. Moss," she protested, her voice quick and flustered.


Wesley's expression stayed impassive as he remarked, "Don't read into it. I don't have feelings for you. I'm just making sure you won't aggravate your sprain to the point where you'll have to hobble into work and force the company to assign someone to babysit you."


The bluntness left her momentarily speechless.


Clearly, whatever she'd imagined back at the beach -that fleeting, ridiculous thought he might actually like her-had been nothing but afoolish fantasy.
Wesley slid Gabriela into the passenger seat and pulled onto the road without missing a beat.


"Could you just drop me at the nearest hotel, Mr.Moss?" she blurted out hastily.


Keeping up his facade as the attentive boss, he replied, "Let me see if any hotels still have vacancies tonight."


Pulling out his phone, he made a quick call. Ten minutes later, he said evenly, "I had Billy check.Every nearby hotel is already full."


Gabriela's brows drew together. That didn't make sense.



It was the holiday season-shouldn't most people be at home with their families? How could the hotels be overflowing?


Then she blinked in surprise. "Hold on-Mr. Clarke's still at the beach, isn't he? Waiting for his girlfriend?"


For the briefest moment, Wesley's composure slipped, but he quickly smoothed it over. "She turned him down-said fireworks and roses were tacky."


So Billy had not only pulled holiday overtime but also endured a doomed proposal.


"Poor Billy," Gabriela murmured, a faint note of sympathy threading her voice. "All that charm and money,yet he's unlucky in love."


Beside her, Wesley-wealthy, magnetic, and fresh from his own failed love confession-kept silent,though his jaw tightened almost imperceptibly.
###Chapter 62 Bringing Her Home





Sensing the sudden heaviness in the car, Gabriela bit back whatever she'd been about to say.


The vehicle slipped free of the city's noisy streets,gliding down a broad stretch of asphalt.


Towering plane trees arched overhead, their rain-slick leaves catching the faint glimmer of streetlights.


With the drizzle gone, the night air felt still, almost watchful.


Little by little, the noise faded, leaving the streetlights to bathe everything in a soft, golden haze.



Gabriela's brows drew together-was her boss seriously giving her a late-night scenic drive?


But with the simmering force radiating from him in the seat beside her, she decided it was wiser to keep that question to herself.


She felt like a mere afterthought in his world,powerless to change whatever plans he had for her.Wherever he meant to take her, the safest choice was to follow without a word.



As the road curved, the skyline opened up, revealing a towering building ahead, its facade crowned with gleaming letters that read "Moss Manor."


Only then did it dawn on Gabriela-this was Wesley's private estate.


Two massive iron gates guarded the entrance, their dark metal both forbidding and sleek with a modern design. At the first glimpse of Wesley's car,the gates stirred to life, parting in a slow, deliberate sweep.


Without breaking stride, Wesley steered through the grand opening, the drive winding for several minutes before the car finally rolled to a stop before the mansion's main entrance.


Gabriela guessed the sprawling estate had to stretch across several thousand acres.


Her awe hadn't even peaked when her gaze caught on two immaculate lines of servants outside,each dressed in neat blue-and-white uniforms, standing at attention to welcome Wesley home.


Startled, she leaned toward him and murmured, "Mr.Moss, your place could pass for a five-star hotel."


From the poised staff to the endless manicured grounds, the gleaming facilities, and the fountains spilling into elegant gardens... even the most extravagant hotel might struggle to match this level of opulence.


Thinking her compliment might coax some warmth from him, she glanced over hopefully.


A deeper shadow crossed his features. "So, you think my house isn't homely enough?"


Gabriela found herself tongue-tied,her mind blank in the face of his unreadable mood.


Wesley, as always, seemed to interpret reality through some private lens no one else shared.


When her silence stretched, he stepped out of the car with a glacial air. A uniformed servant approached at once, bowing slightly as he reached for the keys.


This servant, used to nothing more dramatic than parking Wesley's car, froze when Wesley strode around to the passenger side and, without a word,lifted a striking young woman into his arms.


For a heartbeat, the servant simply stared.


Cradled against Wesley's chest, Gabriela stiffened,her voice edged with embarrassment. "Mr. Moss,please-put me down. I can walk just fine."


His reply came low and clipped. "If you'd prefer not to limp by the end of the night, stay sti11."


Gabriela, unwilling to risk upsetting Wesley, instantly went slack against him, nestling into his arms without the slightest resistance.


Even after Wesley's tall frame vanished through the grand entrance, the servant remained rooted to the spot, clutching the car keys, his mind spinning in disbelief.


In all his years of service here, he had never once seen Wesley bring a woman home-let alone carry one inside. Wesley had never been linked to any romance. Whispers among the staff even claimed he might not be interested inwomen at all.


Yet tonight's scene had shattered that notion.


Whoever had been spreading those ridiculous rumors was in for a rude awakening.


From somewhere deeper inside the manor, a voice called, "Has Mr. Moss returned?"



Miriam Torres, the long-time housekeeper of the manor, rushed out at thesound of the car, hastily draping a coat over her shoulders. When her eyes landed on Wesley carrying a young woman in his arms, she froze mid-step, stunned into silence for several seconds. After lowering Gabriela onto the sofa, Wesley spoke up, his tone carrying a sharp edge. "Don't get up.Stay right where you are."


From the moment she'd been set down, Gabriela hadn't dared shift an inch, yet she still got scolded by Wesley. Now she was convinced her boss was in a foul mood.



Miriam froze mid-step, the medical kit clutched in her hands, as her gaze took in Gabriela's white dress layered beneath a pale gray overcoat.



Recognition flashed in her eyes-this was no ordinary outfit. She remembered when Wesley had personally commissioned the dress over two weeks ago, along with a custom dark gray suit tailored by his private designer.


It had been a matching set, unmistakably a couple's ensemble.



Back then, she'd quietly wondered if the elusive Wesley had finally taken an interest in someone. Now, seeing Gabriela in the dress, she no longer needed to speculate. The answer was written plainly before her.


Now that Wesley was at last entertaining romance,Miriam intended to make the most of it-nudging every opportunity to draw the two of them closer.


She passed the first aid kit into Wesley's hands. "Mr.Moss, I've got soup simmering in the kitchen. Make sure you treat her properly."


He accepted it without a word, his sharpo features set in a cold, focused expression.


After a pause, he crouched in front of Gabriela, his movements deliberate as he eased her shoe off.


Her foot was small and delicate, but the purplish swelling at her ankle made the injury look far worse than she'd expected.


Unwilling to inconvenience him, she murmured, "Mr.Moss,I can manage it myself."


His gaze flicked to hers, voice clipped. "Don't move."

Flipping the kit open, Wesley took out the disinfectant, spraying it over the bruise before smoothing on a layer of pain-relief ointment. His fingers were firm yet unexpectedly gentle as he worked the medication in, his touch careful despite the chill in his expression.


He was obviously out of his depth with such delicate work, his movements hesitant and a touch clumsy.


Still, there was a quiet determination in the way he worked the ointment into her skin, each motion deliberate as he eased the sprain with painstaking care.



Gabriela found her eyes drawn to Wesley again and again.


A stray lock of hair fell forward, shadowing his eyes and making his expression unreadable, lending him an unexpected air of mystery.


For all his reputation, her boss was capable of surprising gentleness. The tension in the room gradually melted into something softer, warmer.


Wesley lifted his head without warning,his voice low but intent. "Is it starting to feel any better?"


In that moment, the clean lines of his face caught the light-refined features framed by a strong jaw, his calm composure offset by a quiet magnetism that was impossible to ignore.


Even in a crouch, he carried himself with an effortless nobility, the kind that made the air around him feel sharper and cooler.


Gabriela's gaze darted away, heat blooming in her cheeks as her heart thudded-this was the first time she'd ever seen the CEO's face so close.



Handsome didn't even begin to cover it.



Snapping back to reality, she realized he'd only asked if she felt better, yet she'd frozen like an idiot and looked away.


To cover her awkwardness, her eyes drifted toward the carved wooden chess set on the side table, and she forced a too-bright smile. "Mr. Moss, is this cedar? It's gorgeous."



Wesley's answer was nothing more than a clipped word."No."



His tone was curt, the words wrapped in a cool detachment that made it clear he wasn't interested in small talk.


Gabriela, still unsure of the wood's type, felt heat creep up her neck.


"It's walnut, not cedar," Miriam corrected warmly,her smile bright as she stepped closer. "Are all the injuries taken care of? I just made soup-come warm up with a bowl."



Wesley rose at once, his movement brisk, a faint stiffness in his posture. "I'm not hungry," he said, his voice low but final.


He glanced at his watch. "I've got a quick meeting to handle. Make sure she's settled in somewhere comfortable."



Miriam promised him she'd handle everything.



Without lingering, Wesley strode toward the study,his steps measured and unhurried, while Gabriela swallowed the urge to protest staying here-she could already imagine him scolding her again.



Miriam turned back with an easy smile. "Come on,Gabriela. Have some soup while it's hot."



Gabriela accepted the bowl with both hands, her gratitude genuine. "Thanks, Miriam."



Once she finished the hearty soup, Miriam guided her upstairs.


Balancing on one foot, Gabriela hopped after her like an awkward, fluffy rabbit.



Miriam's fondness for Gabriela only deepened with each passing glance. After a brief moment of thought, she led Gabriela into one of the manor's more generous guest rooms. The instant Gabriela stepped inside, her breath caught.


Wesley's wealth was unmistakable-even a guest room sprawled out like a luxury suite.


The cool, muted tones of the walls and drapes exuded a quiet elegance, while the tasteful, modern furnishings radiated understated sophistication.


Miriam soon returned with an armful of necessities-freshly laundered towels, a neatly boxed toothbrush,and a set of sleepwear.



Yet "sleepwear" was hardly the right word; what Miriam laid on the bed was a silky light-blue slip dress, the delicate spaghetti straps and fluid fabric whispering of indulgence rather than rest.
 ###Chapter 63 Care To Explain Why You're In My Room

Gabriela hesitated, then asked in a low voice,"Miriam, do you happen to have any warmer pajamas?"


Miriam's tone stayed light. "No need, dear. The heating's more than enough to keep you cozy."



Gabriela was at a loss for words.



She'd been hoping for something with a bit more coverage, but as a guest, she couldn't bring herself to push. With a small nod, she accepted the slip dress without protest.


"Will you be alright washing up on your own?" Miriam asked.



"Of course," Gabriela answered quickly.


She'd weathered far worse injuries on her own  before; this little sprain was nothing in comparison.


Wesley's and Miriam's concern left her a little dazed,the warmth of their kindness pressing in on her.


Miriam gave a reassuring nod. "Go on and freshen up. I'll be right outside. There's shampoo and shower gel ready in the bathroom. Call me anytime if you need something."



Gabriela murmured her thanks more than once before slipping into the bathroom with the slip dress draped over her arm.



Inside, she paused, once again struck by the opulence of the upper class-even the guest bathroom was larger than her entire bedroom.



Though her foot ached, she felt oddly self-conscious about using the bathtub in Wesley's home.


Opting for the shower instead, she turned on the water. Standing was awkward and unsteady, and the process dragged on until she finally finished.


Fresh from her shower, Gabriela slipped into the slip dress, a prickle of self-consciousness creeping over her at how little it actually covered. To her relief, she wouldn't have to step outside the room in it.


She towel-dried her hair as she stepped out of the bathroom-then froze mid-stride.



A tall man stood by the bed, his suit jacket draped neatly over a chair, fingers unclasping the strap of his watch.



At the sound of movement, he turned his head, his hand stalling over the watch.


Gabriela's breath caught. She whipped a hand over her eyes. Her voice wavered. "M-Mr. Moss..."


Why on earth was he in her room? His white shirt hung open, every button undone, revealing a stretch of toned skin beneath.



Wait a second-this was her room.



Why was she covering her eyes like a startled child when he was the one who'd stumbled into the wrong room? Snapping back to her senses, Gabriela folded her arms tightly across her chest, her glare sharp enough to cut glass.


"W-what exactly do you think you're doing?" she demanded.



Wesley, fresh from an intense meeting with his think tank, looked entirely unfazed.


After a full day cramped in an airplane seat, all he'd wanted was to sink into a scalding bath.



Who could possibly explain why Gabriela was in his room?



And why was she standing there in such a skimpy dress, hardly suited for the winter chill?


Those long, delicate legs-how could she bare them so openly?



A sudden rush of heat burned through Wesley,and he jerked his gaze away.


"Care to explain why you're in my room?" he asked. The irritation in his voice made Gabriela falter. Had she somehow wandered into the wrong place?


No, that couldn't be-it was Miriam who had led her here.


She straightened and replied quickly, "Miriam was the one who brought me."


A dull throb began to build behind Wesley's temples.


What on earth had Miriam been thinking?


He refastened his shirt buttons with brisk, precise movements, then draped his 'suit jacket over Gabriela's shoulders before calling Miriam inside.


With a faint edge in his voice, Wesley asked, "She's a guest,Miriam.Why would you put her in here?"


Miriam blinked, genuinely perplexed. "Where else could she possibly stay? You brought her back, so it's only natural she stays in your room."


Massaging the bridge of his nose, Wesley replied with measured patience, "Find her a guest room."  Having watched Wesley grow up, Miriam knew all too well that this stony look meant he was genuinely angry.


A flicker of disappointment passed through her.


She'd thought, for once, he might actually be falling for someone-but clearly, things had stalled halfway and now they were in separate rooms.


"Fine," she said at last.


Dragging her feet, Miriam went to prepare a guest room, only to find every available one tucked too far from Wesley's bedroom.


That was the trouble with a house this enormous-sometimes too much space just made things complicated. If there'd only been a single room, she wouldn't be stuck with this dilemma.



After pacing in indecision for a while, she returned and met Wesley's gaze. "The guest rooms aren't ready. How about letting you and Gabriela share, at least for tonight?"
Gabriela gaped at her, stunned by Miriam's audacious proposal.Wesley didn't even like her-yet Miriam had the nerve to suggest something so outrageous.He'd blow a fuse for sure.


True enough, his brow knit tighter, anger flashing in his eyes.


Wrapped in his jacket, Gabriela inched farther away,hoping to slip out of the blast radius.


She sighed at the awkward situation, aware she was partly to blame.


She'd sensed something was wrong the moment she stepped into the room, so why had she gone ahead and showered?


First, there'd been that beachside misunderstanding where she assumed Wesley was interested in her,and now this disaster.


If he so much as got the wrong idea, he would think she was an employee with ulterior motives.



Her well-paid, twenty-eight-grand-a-month job suddenly felt as if it were dangling by a thread.


Wesley caught the flicker of emotions crossing Gabriela's face and let out a quiet sigh before declaring coolly, "I'll take the study tonight."


Gabriela blinked,momentarily thrown.


This was his bedroom-she couldn't just sprawl here as if it were hers, even if he wasn't using it.


Seeing her teeter on the verge of tears, Miriam assumed Wesley's sharp tone had rattled her. She stepped closer, her voice warm with reassurance."It's fine, dear. I should've planned the room assignments better. Sleep here for now, and l promise the best and largest guest room will be ready for you by tomorrow."


Gabriela stared at her, stunned. Tomorrow? She was expected to stay here another night?


Spending even a single night here had her pulse hammering so wildly she could hardly breathe.Another day under this roof and she might not make it to the end of the holidays-never mind the return to work.



"No need to trouble yourself.."


"It's fine." Miriam cut in with brisk warmth. "Just get some sleep. I'll run an extra quilt over to Wesley."


Quilt in hand, Miriam stepped out, a nagging thought tugging at her.


Earlier, her gaze had drifted to Gabriela-those elegant curves, that unmistakable hourglass frame.Her face was another kind of rare beauty entirely,the sort that lingered in memory.


And yet, with such a breathtaking woman right here,Wesley had still chosen to sleep in thestudy.


Could the rumors be true-was Wesley really not interested in women? Was that the real reason he had never shown the slightest spark of interest in Gabriela?



The servant who was responsible for parking Wesley's car vowed to hunt down the source of the rumors. Crouching around the corner, he caught every word of Miriam's under-the-breath musings.


The shock nearly knocked him backward.


Miriam and Wesley were practically family. He never imagined the rumors about Wesley had started with her.


Well,he wasn't about to invite trouble. With a wary glance over his shoulder, he melted into the shadows and slipped away.



Meanwhile, Miriam smoothed the thick quilt across the study, her brow faintly furrowed. After a pause,she asked with quiet insistence, "Why not just stay in the same room with Gabriela?"



Wesley let out a slow, measured breath, his gaze steady as he answered, "Keep things natural, Miriam.And for heaven's sake, don't frighten her."


Miriam's brows lifted in surprise.


From the sound of it, he hadn't managed to win Gabriela over-so that was why he was choosing to sleep in the study.


A spark of inspiration flashed through her mind,bright and sudden.


Unaware of any schemes brewing beyond the door,Gabriela remained frozen in place, hesitant to move.Only after several long moments did she dare inch toward the bed.


She could still picture Wesley standing there not long ago, sliding off his jacket with unhurried ease.


Though he had left, the cool, commanding air he carried seemed to linger in the room, wrapping around her like an invisible shroud.



A charged, almost tangible energy clung to the air-the sheer presence of Wesley, the man who had set her pulse racing only hours earlier.


Forcing steady breaths, she lowered herself to the bed's edge, her tender ankle allowingno other option.


The mattress cradled her in decadent softness, far  more luxurious than she'd imagined.


After battling the pull of sleep for half an hour, her resistance faltered; with her eyes drifting shut, she surrendered to the comfort and let herself sink into slumber.


The moment she did, the earlier scene replayed vividly in her mind-Wesley's shirt hanging loose,revealing the firm, sculpted lines of muscle that carried both strength and an unspoken sense of safety.



Even his waist had looked strong and lean.


She pressed her palms over her face, a ripple of regret tugging at her. Why on earth had she covered her eyes with her hand?


Would it really have mattered if she had stolen a few more glances?
###Chapter 64 Idiot





Restless thoughts of Wesley kept Gabriela from drifting off, her mind circling back to him no matter how she tried to distract herself.


Each time she shifted in bed, her sore ankle brushed against the sheets, sending a quick, sharp jolt through her and drawing a wince.


The whole day had felt cursed from start to finish.



After rolling over a few more times, she snatched up her phone and fired off a message to "NotASaunders," venting her irritation. "What exactly was that stunt at the wedding today? Yo showed up with a girlfriend and didn't even warn me?"


She waited for what felt like forever, but her screen stayed blank.


Frustration bubbling over, she typed out another message. "If you weren't going to help me, you should've said so. I could have rented a boyfriend myself. You told me to buy the suit-so why set me up to look like a fool?"


Yet again, silence was all that came.


Her temper flared so hot she nearly sent another message demanding the hundred thousand dollars back immediately.


For a spoiled heir like Brenden, that kind of money was no more than a night's pocket change. For her,every single bill had been fought for and earned.


At last, after what felt like an eternity, a reply popped up."Idiot."



Gabriela stared at the screen, stunned.


What the hell was that supposed to mean? After humiliating her in public, wasting her money, and making her the butt of the joke, Brenden had the audacity to throw that at her?


Fury coursed through her as she smacked the mattress with her palm-then froze mid-swing. This wasn't even her bed. If she broke it, she wouldn't be able to afford the damages.


She pushed herself upright, drawing in a few steadying breaths until the tightness in her chest began to ease.


Her thoughts drifted back to the whole ridiculous business of having Brenden pretend to be her boyfriend, and the more she replayed it, the clearer it became-he had never been committed. Even after returning from Afluena, he'd hesitated.



She was supposed to notice the warning signs at that moment.



Yet he'd told her to buy a suit, even gone so far as to present her with a gown, and that kindness had sparked her hope again.


Then, on the wedding day, he'd showed up late-while girlfriend number forty-one had already been waiting at the venue.


If Wesley hadn't stepped in, Josh would probably stil be sobbing into his champagne.


From the very beginning, Brenden had been playing her.



The realization sent heat surging through Gabriela again, and she silently vowed to return the humiliation at the first opportunity.


For tonight, though, revenge could wait. Sleep came first.



Gabriela slid beneath the covers without hesitation,letting the mattress swallow her up in warmth.


The pillow carried a faint trace of shower gel,layered with a subtle masculine scent that wrapped around her like an invisible embrace.



Heat crept into her cheeks as she curled deeper into the blanket, the phantom sensation of Wesley's arms lingering in her mind.


True to her nature, she didn't linger on unpleasant thoughts. Once she'd shaken off the last of her earlier frustration, her breathing slowed and sleep claimed her.



Her dreams spiraled into a collage of vivid,disordered moments-every one of them centered on Wesley, his tall frame and sculpted muscles impossible to ignore.


By morning, the knot of tension had unraveled. She woke feeling unexpectedly light, her ankle tender but far less painful.


It seemed the ointment Wesley had rubbed in worked.



After a quick wash, she slipped back into yesterday's clothes, tugged on the cheerful slippers Miriam had set out for her, and padded toward the stairs.



Wesley sat on the sofa, the morning paper spread neatly in his hands. At the faint sound of footsteps on the stairs, he lifted his head.


Instead of his usual tailored suit, he wore a pale knit sweater, the casual attire softening the crisp,imposing edge he normally carried and lending a quiet warmth to his striking features.



When she faced him, Gabriela's pulse quickened and unbidden images from last night's dreams rushed back, making it impossible for her to meet his gaze.


She kept her chin tucked as his smooth, clear voice reached her. "Morning, Gabriela."


The early hour left a subtle huskiness in his tone, and the sound rippled through her in a way she couldn't quite name.



She straightened slightly, answering with careful respect, "Good morning, Mr. Moss."


Wesley's gaze flicked to her ankle, noting she was able to stand evenly now, a clear sign the injury had eased.



The faintest crease in his brow smoothed away.



"Good morning, Gabriela!" Miriam called warmly as she stepped out of the kitchen. "Come, have breakfast." One after another, the breakfast plates appeared,filling the table with inviting aromas.


Wesley had already taken his seat, so Gabriela,unwilling to keep him waiting, quickly slid into the chair beside him.



She reached for the serving ladle, pouring oatmeal into a bowl for Wesley, then filled one for herself and Miriam with practiced ease.


Her movements were fluid and confident-little gestures she'd performed countless times, sO natural they barely needed thought.


Miriam's opinion of her rose another notch.


Settling beside Gabriela, Miriam asked with genuine concern, "Is your ankle feeling any better? You should let Wesley put some more ointment on it later."



Gabriela had just lifted a spoonful of oatmeal to her lips when Miriam's comment made her pause. She set the spoon down, shaking her head with a small smile. "That's not necessary. It barely hurts now.I can take care of it myself."


She prided herself on not being fragile, and the thought of asking Wesley to tend to her injury again felt excessive.



Miriam, however, wouldn't budge. "Don't brush it off.If I say you need it, you need it." Her tone left little room for argument.



Gabriela was at a loss for words.



Still, no matter how firm Miriam sounded, she wasn't about to let Wesley near her ankle again.


Wesley, noticing she could walk without difficulty,didn't press her either.



Not long after breakfast, Billy appeared with the six-member tink tank in tow.



The Athea project might have been wrapped up,but other ventures still needed their final touches.


Billy strode in with brisk confidence, energy radiating from him, the neatly dressed team at his back exuding an air of polished authority.



Gabriela's gaze lingered on Billy longer than she intended.



No wonder Wesley held him in such high esteem-his presence carried an effortless authority even in the role of an assistant.



Was that quiet satisfaction in his eyes because his proposal had gone off successfully last night?



If that were the case, she was genuinely glad for him.


Offering a warm smile, she called out, "Good morning, Mr. Clarke. I didn't expect to see you here."


Billy froze for a beat, caught off guard by the sight of Gabriela-striking, poised, and far too dazzling for the early hour.


Hadn't Wesley's love confession been a bust? Then why was she here now, at this time of morning clearly not just arriving? Could it be Wesley had found another way to win her over?


Still, Wesley wasn't a man whose affairs one dared to speculate about.


Billy smoothed his expression at once and spoke in a courteous tone. "Good morning, Miss Haynes. I'm here to give Mr. Moss an update on the project."


"I see." Gabriela's lips curved in a teasing wink paired with a warm smile before she moved down the line,greeting each team member in turn. "I'll let you all get to your meeting," she added lightly.



She pivoted away at an unhurried pace, the faint hitch in her step betraying a limp.


Billy's brow furrowed, and beside him, Aaron's curiosity got the better of him. "Why's Miss Haynes walking like that? Did she hurt herself?"


Realization dawned on Billy, hitting him so suddenly it left him momentarily frozen in place.


Wesley had never been the romantic sort, the kind of man who could go decades without so much as a flicker of affection for anyone.


Yet when that rare spark finally took hold, it roared to life with an intensity no one could have foreseen.


It appeared Wesley had shared a passionate night with Gabriela.



Meanwhile, Gabriela sank into the sofa beside Miriam, the soft yarn pooled in her lap as she learned the delicate art of knitting socks.


From the time she was small, life had been a constant balancing act-each day spent tiptoeing over thin ice, working herself ragged just to keep food on the table and stay in school.


Every waking hour had been shadowed by the need to guard herself, to brace for the next cruel,calculated scheme Phyllis might unleash.


A simple, comforting pastime like this was something she had never even dared to imagine for herself.



Miriam guided her with patient precision, her voice low and steady, while Gabriela leaned in over her work, intent on perfecting every stitch. She was so focused that she missed the odd, lingering gleam in Billy's eyes.
###Chapter 65 Loretta's Visit





Wesley sat in his study, the rustle of turning pages the only sound as he immersed himself in his book.



When the think tank members arrived with Billy in tow, he barely looked up, only instructing them to keep things concise-this was, after all, their final meeting before everyone scattered for the New Year holiday.



In meetings, Wesley's presence carried a natural weight. His cold, unreadable stare was enough to make people drop their gaze, and he usually steered discussions with effortless control.


Yet today, Billy's sidelong glances kept breaking the rhythm.


Wesley's brow tightened.


Was Billy still sour about being left to wait in the rain at the beach last night? Despite the undercurrent of distractions, the agenda moved briskly, each point settled with Wesley's usual precision.



The meeting wrapped up, and, as was customary,Wesley distributed year-end bonuses to the team.


This time, though, he went further-Billy received not only the bonus but also a sleek black Cayenne from his garage, a car so pristine it might as well have just rolled out of the showroom.



"The company's had a great year. I appreciate your hard work, Billy," Wesley said, his tone calm but firm.



Though their own bonuses were nothing to scoff at,the think tank members couldn't help a flicke of envy at the lavish gift.


Billy, on the other hand, stood frozen, staring at the car keys, trying to gauge whether this waspure generosity... or Wesley's way of buying his silence.


After all, he knew more than anyone else about what was going on between Wesley and Gabriela. Still, who could turn down the temptation of a gleaming luxury car?


Billy wasted no time snatching up the keys, flashing a grin. "Relax, Mr. Moss. Last night stays between us."


Wesley could only stare at him in silence.


Half an hour in a light drizzle and Billy was acting like a martyr?


The car was supposed to be a bonus, not some consolation prize for getting wet.


If Billy wanted to spin it that way, Wesley wasn't about to correct him.


As Billy and the think tank filed out of the study, the team couldn't help but shoot envious glances his way over the prize Wesley had given him.


"I've seen Mr. Moss take that Cayenne for a spin-it's a stunner."


"Now I'm tempted to trade my car in for something flashier."Passing through the living room, Billy waved the others on and drifted toward Gabriela. With a clenched fist for emphasis, he murmured, "If you run into trouble, just come find me. I've got your back."


Gabriela blinked in mild confusion.



It seemed Billy's recent triumph in winning over his girlfriend had put him in such a generous mood that even she-a lowly secretary-was swept up in it.


A pang of guilt pricked at her as she remembered how Billy had been left standing in the rain while she stayed warm and dry beneath an umbrella, quietly watching everything unfold.


Feeling a flicker of embarrassment, she gave him a small nod. "Thanks, Mr. Clarke."


Noticing the shadow in her eyes, Billy offered a reassuring pat on her shoulder. "Come on, cheer up -you're amazing."


With that, he pocketed the car keys, straightened his tie, and strode off toward his new car, his steps practically humming with excitement.


Gabriela watched his buoyant energy and couldn't help murmuring, "Love really is a beautiful thing."


Miriam wasted no time in chiming back. "Your turn will come soon enough."


By then, she had already spotted the freshly knitted mitten in Gabriela's lap.


She accepted the knitting from Gabriela with a warm smile. "Your hands are so nimble, Gabriela. Every stitch is perfectly even-absolutely lovely."


Gabriela's cheeks warmed under the praise."That's only because you taught me so well."


With a playful glint in her eyes, Miriam reached for a bundle of soft, pale yarn. "Come on, I'll show you how to knit a scarf."


Gabriela's face lit up. "I'd love to."


As they worked, Miriam's natural gift for chatter spilled out-she wandered from talking about the vases and coffee sets around the house, to Wesley's preferred coffee blend, and even the blooms in the backyard. Even if Gabriela merely listened, Miriam could fill the room with easy conversation for hours.


When Wesley finally appeared, the sight that greeted him was quietly endearing.


Gabriela was sitting close beside Miriam, their heads nearly touching, hands busy with needles and yarn,sharing gentle talk over the small, comforting details of daily life.


The scene radiated quiet contentment.


A faint smile tugged at Wesley's lips, a wave of warmth and ease settling over him.


After lingering for a moment longer, he retreated to his study and picked up his book again.


Gabriela, oblivious to his brief visit, kept her focus on the scarf in her hands.



Her injured foot kept her mostly anchored to the couch, and the steady rhythm of knitting felt like a pleasant novelty. She spent much of the afternoon there, and by the time dinner rolled around,half the scarf was done.



The design unfurled into a delicate pattern of branching leaves, refined enough to draw the eye whether examined up close or admired from a distance.



Gabriela's lips curved in quiet satisfaction.



A voice spoke from nearby, warm and matter-of-fact."Your hands really are skillful."


Thinking it was Miriam, Gabriela laughed lightly. "actually find knitting a scarf easier than making mittens.Here,look..."


She turned, scarf in hand, and froze. Standing beside the couch was an old woman she didn't recognize.


The woman wore a neat, plain blouse, its simple lines immaculate. Her gray hair was neatly combed, and though time had etched fine lines into her face, hints of the beauty she once possessed still lingered in her features.



It took Gabriela a moment to recover before she asked politely, "Hello, ma'am. Who are you here to see?"



The visitor was none other than Wesley's grandmother, Loretta.


Loretta's sharp gaze swept over Gabriela, taking in every detail. The young woman's beauty was undeniable-exactly as Miriam had claimed. In looks,she could stand beside Wesley without drawing any complaints.



Her character, though... that remained unclear for now.



Before Loretta could respond, several servants appeared, arms laden with oversized bags. They bowed slightly asone of them asked with deference,"Where would you like these placed,madam?"


"Set them in the backyard-find a spacious spot,"Loretta instructed briskly. Once the orders were given, she pivoted back to Gabriela, her tone abrupt. "Your name?"


Though the old woman's manner held little warmth,Gabriela kept her poise and answered with quiet courtesy, "Gabriela Haynes."


"What do you do? How are you connected to my grandson? And what brings you here?"


Gabriela caught on immediately-this had to be Wesley's grandmother-and answered with a polite smile, "I'm Mr. Moss's personal secretary. I've injured my foot..."


Loretta cut her off.a secretary."


Her mind went straight to what Wesley had once mentioned about a young woman Fiona had trampled over.



Recently, Fiona had been quietly using a fortune-teller to feed Loretta the belief that she was the perfect match for Wesley.


To Loretta, that notion still held firm-Fiona was in 


--
her eyes, a woman blessed by fate and destined to be with Wesley.


When Miriam phoned to announce that Wesley had brought a girlfriend home, Loretta's first response was a flash of disapproval.


In her eyes, it was hardly proper for a young woman to stay at a man's house before marriage. Finding out that Gabriela was Wesley's secretary only intensified her hostility.



Her gaze swept over Gabriela with quiet scrutiny.


Gabriela's face was small and exquisitely proportioned, every delicate line of her bone structure lending her an elegance that would hold its beauty for years.



Large, luminous eyes tilted upward at the corners beneath finely arched double lids, their warmth offset by a slender, well-shaped nose.


The combination gave her an air both innocent and faintly alluring. Despite her reservations about Gabriela, Loretta murmured, "You really are beautiful."


Fiona had beauty, but Gabriela outshone her.


Gabriela, unable to hear those quiet words, tilted her head politely. "Pardon me, madam-what did you say?"


Loretta blinked as if roused from a daze, then curtly said, "Come with me."


Setting aside her half-finished scarf, Gabriela rose and followed.



Loretta's stride was quick and sure, the product of decades of farm work that kept her spry even in her later years.


Gabriela, slowed by her aching foot, lagged several paces behind.


Unaware of Gabriela's injury, Loretta mistook the lag for frailty. Her disapproval settled even deeper.
###Chapter 66 Do You Have Feelings For Her
The servants carried the two bulging bags into the backyard.



At the far edge, a wide stretch of square-brick paving caught the sunlight.


After instructing them to return to their duties,Loretta crouched beside the bags and unfastened them.



The tops fell open to reveal a heap of fresh scallions,their green stalks still glistening faintly from the previous day's rain.



When Gabriela stepped closer, Loretta bent to lift a handful, her hands moving briskly as she said,"These are from our own garden, not dried yet.Yesterday's rain left them damp, so they'll need a few more days in the sun." She shot Gabriela a brief look as she went on, "While there's still light, come help me."


Gabriela agreed and mirrored her movements, laying the scallions out in an even layer.


The ache in her injured foot made each bend forward a slow, careful effort.


Noticing her sluggish pace, Loretta's brow furrowed."In my day, we had to work hard just to keep food on the table."



Gabriela's cheeks warmed with shame.



She hadn't always been so delicate.


Memories surfaced of the night before the college entrance exams, when Phyllis had deliberately poured scalding water on her arm in the dead of night. Even with a fever the next morning, Gabriela had sat through every test, gritting her teeth against the throbbing pain until the final paper was done.


She'd earned her place at the university she'd dreamed of, slowly clawing her way out from und Phyllis's shadow.


So how had she grown fragile over something as minor as a sprained ankle?


Maybe it was because Wesley himself had applied the ointment, or because Miriam kept fussing over her, letting her slip into the unfamiliar luxury of being cared for.


Determined to shake it off, she picked up her pace, a thin sheen of sweat glistening at the tip of her nose.


"What are you two doing out here?" Wesley's voice came from nearby, deep and steady.


He crossed the short distance in a few long strides,his expression calm, yet edged with a concern so faint it was almost hidden.



Loretta cast him a brief look before answering in an unhurried tone, "Can't you tell we're laying scallions out to dry?"


"Why didn't you give me a heads-up before coming?" Wesley, ever patient with her, pressed."I could've at least sent someone to pick you up."


She dismissed the offer without hesitation. "I can make my own way here. No point wasting time and gas driving back and forth."


While she went on grumbling, Wesley's gaze drifted to Gabriela, noting the fine sheen of sweat clinging to her nose. "Gabriela, go take a seat over there," he urged.


At his cue, Miriam promptly guided Gabriela to perch on the low flower bed nearby.


Loretta's expression tightened with irritation. She jabbed a finger toward Wesley and snapped, "I only asked your secretary to help with a few scallions, and now you're upset about it?"


Fiona had even helped her earlier, pulling out a bunch together.


Wesley let out a weary sigh as he clarified, "Her foot's injured-getting around isn't easy for her right now. Whatever needs to be done, someone else can handle it just as well."


Loretta shot back, planting her hands on her hips,"Do you keep useless people here for decoration?Everyone in this estate has their duties. She's sitting there knitting something as if she's on vacation."


A hot flush of embarrassment crept over Gabriela's cheeks.



Miriam's kindness had lulled her into forgetting her place.


A secretary spending her day knitting in her boss's home-it did look improper.


"Please be reasonable, Grandma," Wesley responded evenly. "She's injured-she can't stand for long stretches."


Loretta's expression darkened as she continued,you saying I'm being unreasonable? Fine then, I'll go.I won't bother coming here again."


She had never been fond of lingering at the estate,and even during New Year celebrations, her visits were scarce. This time, Miriam's casual mention that Wesley had brought home a girlfriend piqued her curiosity enough to come and see for herself.


She intended to gauge Gabriela's grit-yet the girl hadn't even broken a sweat before Wesley began hovering protectively over her.


Loretta began bundling the scallions, acting as if she were on her way out.


Wesley,well-versed in her little performances, let out a quiet sigh but still stepped forward. "Here, let me give you a hand."


"How could I trouble a big shot like you?" she muttered, arching a brow at him.


"I'm just sittingin the study reading," he replied mildly. "Not exactly swamped with work."


Scooping up a small bundle, Loretta peeled away a few wilted yellow leaves with deft fingers. "Even the finest things need a bit of trimming now and then.Don't you think?" she remarked. Wesley caught the implication in her words and answered in a flat tone, "You're right."


Gabriela stayed silent. The sight of Loretta chiding Wesley while he responded with the calm indulgence one might show a stubborn child was startling.


For the first time, the man she'd always known as cool and distant seemed warmer-human, even-someone she could almost imagine speaking to without feeling intimidated.


Loretta remarked sharply, "I'm just helping you put your secretary to thetest."


Wesley pressed his fingers to his brow with a muted sigh before turning to Miriam. "Miriam, would you bring me some dried scallions?"


Loretta had always sent her home-grown ones to the estate, carefully cured in the sun until they were ready.


Miriam returned in moments, a small handful resting in her palm. Wesley plucked one and held it out for Loretta to see."Notice how this one's wrapped in more withered leaves, the outer layers tinged red? Sometimes even the loveliest things need layers that seem needless,just to keep them safe."



With deliberate care, he peeled the skins away, one after another, until the tender white heart was revealed.



"If not for those red layers, the fresh core wouldn't stay crisp for months-sometimes even half a year,"he added lightly.


Loretta knew he was making a point, but still muttered under her breath, "You're shielding her like this...do you have feelings for her?"



A quiet sigh escaped Wesley as he responded,"She's just a guest, for now."



Loretta's frown deepened. "I just think it's inappropriate-she hasn't even married you, yet here she is at your home..." Wesley cut in gently, guiding her a few steps aside,"Gabriela's an orphan. Her cousin got married yesterday and locked her out late at night, leaving her nowhere to stay. She was going to check into a hotel, but she twisted her ankle last night and couldn't walk, so I brought her back here. She works for my company, after all. I couldn't just abandon her to handle things alone."


At that, a glimmer of sympathy softened Loretta's expression. "She's such a bright, lively girl. How could she..."


Her voice trailed off, the unspoken misfortune hanging between them.


"She's upbeat, compassionate, and competent at her work," Wesley stated, his tone calm but resolute."That's why I respect her-and why I chose her as my secretary."


Though unwilling to admit she'd been too harsh,Loretta knew she'd crossed the line.


She kept up her gruff act, but her stance had eased. "Fine. I won't make her dry scallions.Happy now?"


Though Gabriela couldn't make out their words, she caught the flicker of irritation clouding Loretta's face and, in a quiet voice, offered, "Mr. Moss, my ankle's feeling much better. I can help out."


Loretta shot Gabriela a sharp glare, masking her embarrassment over the false accusation. "Why are you meddling? Just stick to knitting that scarf," she snapped.


Gabriela stared at her, momentarily at a loss.


Wesley closed the gap between them in a few swift strides, lowering his voice so only she could hear. "ls your ankle in pain? Can you move on it?"


His eyes held hers, dark and unreadable, his tone deep and controlled.


Unsure what emotion lingered there, Gabriela answered swiftly, "It aches a bit, but it should be fine tomorrow."


"Make sure you rest it." His hand lifted as if to ruffle her hair but hesitated in midair before he let it fall, turning away instead.


The whole squabble over drying scallions ended under Wesley's firm handling, y/et Miriam still looked uneasy.


She ushered Gabriela back toward the living room,then tugged Loretta into a quiet corner. Leaning close, she murmured, "Why didn't you tell me you'd be dropping by?"


"I wanted it to be a surprise," Loretta said with a knowing lift of her chin. "And I need to see for myself what kind of woman has caught Wesley's eye and became his girlfriend."


"She's not his girlfriend-nowhere close," Miriam replied with a rueful sigh. "Last night, I even arranged for Gabriela to stay in Mr. Moss's room..."


She quickly recounted the events of the previouS evening,ending with a weary shake of her head. "He is over thirty, and he still doesn't have a woman by his side. Do you have any idea what people are saying behind his back?"


Loretta pressed."Spit it out."


"They think he's into men, not women," Miriam said,lowering her voice to an even more hushed whisper.


She cast a quick glance around before adding, "I never dared tell you before, afraid you'd be upset about it."


Loretta's expression hardened as she countered,"Don't be silly. How could he not like women? These rumors are nothing but nonsense."


Loretta frowned. No wonder Wesley hadn't even glanced Fiona's way when she tried to introduce them.



The grandson she'd raised with such care was attracted to men? That was utterly unthinkable.


Miriam pressed on. "Last night, he brought Gabriela home, and for a moment I thought that he'd finally found a woman he truly cared about. But when a lovely girl like her appeared in his room wearing a slip dress, he didn't so much as reach for her, barely even looked at her. I called you here so we could figure out how to push things along between them.But instead, you showed up and played the villain."


Loretta was left staring at Miriam in stunned silence.


"And now," Miriam went on with a sigh. "Gabriela probably thinks less of him than before. At this rate,he'll end up alone for the rest of his life."


"That's bullshit!" Loretta shot back, her worry flaring."Wesley's an exceptional man-what woman wouldn't be drawn to him?"


In her mind, Wesley was flawless, the one who did the choosing, not the other way around. The idea of a woman not liking him was outrageous.


Miriam's voice dropped to a near whisper. "But maybe...Wesley's gay."
###Chapter 67 Having A Change Of Opinion About Gabriela
Loretta's vision dimmed, and for a moment she thought she might collapse.


The rumor was absurd-utterly impossible.


"These people are talking rubbish!" she burst out.


Miriam, spotting her agitation, leaned in with calculated gravity. "Do you remember that fortunate teller you brought in last time? The one who warned something bad would happen to Mr. Moss before year's end?"


Loretta nodded. "Oh, yes-it sounded dreadful!Thank goodness I paid for those protective rites."


"If you ask me, Gabriela is the one who warded it off,"Miriam continued, each word deliberate. "When she arrived last night, she was so badly hurt she couldn't even stand. Mr. Moss carried her all the way inside  himself."


Could a delicate young woman like Gabriela truly shield Wesley from ill fortune?

The thought hovered in Loretta's mind, impossible yet strangely compelling.

Miriam carried on weaving her story. "See how her cheekbones slope gently instead ofjutting out? That softness means good fortune. And the radiant, joyful energy that follows her? Every sign points to a woman born under a lucky star."


Loretta drew in a quick breath. "I was so taken with her beauty, I didn't even notice these."

Miriam said firmly, "Believe me, any man who wins her hand would be walking away with the prize of a lifetime."


"I judged her wrong," Loretta admitted at last.

Miriam's tone softened. "It's fine. There are still ways we can... encourage developments between Mr.Moss and her." Leaning closer, she murmured a scheme into Loretta's ear, "When he turns in tonight,we'll do this..."


Loretta faltered. "Are you sure that will work?"


She had always enjoyed her conversations with Miriam,trusting the housekeeper without question-perhaps because of those warm, kind eyes and her steady, gentle manner.


But Gabriela was another matter entirely, and Loretta's unfamiliarity bred caution.


Miriam pressed on. "For now, we need to keep Gabriela here. Mr. Moss upset Gabriela last night,and the thought of staying another night likely unsettles her."



Loretta gave a small nod. "Alright, we'll do as you say. I'll figure out a way to make her stay."


Gabriela, despite her injured foot, had carried out her tasks with quiet patience, never once complaining.That gentle, agreeable nature had won Loretta's favor. Now she far preferred Gabriela to Fiona, whose  spoiled delicacy grated in comparison.


When their private discussion ended, Loretta and Miriam returned to the living room, where Gabriela sat waiting with a calm composure.


She began, "My foot's feeling much better. My uncle called earlier and asked me to come home."


At that, whatever hesitation Loretta still harbored vanished in an instant. She leaned forward, her tone almost urgent. "Leaving already? Is something bothering you here?"


Gabriela, puzzled by the sudden warmth in Loretta's manner, answered politely, "Mr. Moss was kind enough to take me in last night, and I'd hate to impose any further."


Miriam leaned in with a warm smile. "It's no trouble at all. The manor's big enough to spare a room for you."


Gabriela gave an awkward smile.


But the room they meant was Wesley's own bedroom. Catching the flicker of hesitation in her eyes, Loretta felt a pang of shame. Only last night she'd been convinced Gabriela had no self-respect,that she was chasing after money and would latch onto her grandson without a shred of dignity.


"Gabriela, are you angry at me for giving you a hard time earlier?" she asked gently, Gabriela shook her head quickly. "Not at all. My uncle'sasking me to come home."


"With that injured foot of yours, how are you even planning to get there? Stay another night,and leave tomorrow once you've had more rèst." Loretta's eyes grew misty with theatrical sorrow. "If you walk out now, it's as good as saying you are upset with me."


With Loretta's voice brimming with earnestness,Gabriela felt cornered into agreeing. "Fine, I'll give it one more night."


Miriam exhaled in quiet relief, instantly heading to the kitchen to arrange dinner.


Knowing she'd be staying, Gabriela pulled out her phone to call her uncle.


She spoke softly into the phone. "Yes, I'm not coming back tonight. My ankle's still sore, so I'll stay over at a friend's place... No, it's nothing serious-no need for the hospital."


From the side, Loretta observed her.


Wesley had said Gabriela had been locked out late at night, yet here she was, still speaking to her uncle with such unshakable respect.


Gabriela truly seemed a rare find.


Loretta's affection for her deepened-after all, here was a young woman who treated everyone with genuine respect.


Gabriela, however, felt a prickle of unease beneath Loretta's suddenly adoring gaze, sensing an odd shift in her demeanor.



·.·


Dinner was soon served, drawing everyone to the long,gleaming table.


Loretta's gaze sharpened when she noticed how closely Gabriela attended to Wesley's tastes.


When a platter of spicy shredded vegetables landed near him, Gabriela leaned in and murmured, "Mr.Moss, maybe go easy on this one. Or I can take out the chilies for you-how about that?"


As his secretary, she knew his preferences by heart.


Wesley couldn't handle too much heat because of his heart, yet he still craved the faint burn of spice.


He gave a quiet "Okay," and though his face remained composed, the faint curl at the edge of his lips betrayed the lift in his mood.


Loretta found the change in him astonishing.


Her grandson had always been stubborn, brushing off nearly everyone's advice-yet Gabriela could move him without effort.


She cast a sidelong glance at Miriam, who met her gaze with a serene smile that wordlessly said, "Told you she was remarkable."


Once dinner was cleared away, Loretta and Miriam drew Gabriela into a round of cards.


Laughter and lighthearted banter carried them past ten o'clock, until at last they let her slip away to her room for the night.


Gabriela climbed the stairs, her gaze sweeping over the sprawling master bedroom with quiet reluctance."Miriam, would it be alright if I stayed in a guest room tonight?"


With practiced ease, Miriam offered a smooth excuse. "We ended up playing so late there wasn't time to ready one. Just spend another night here."


A faint discomfort prickled at Gabriela. "And...what about Mr.Moss?"


Loretta cut in before Miriam could speak. "He can keep sleeping in the study."


Gabriela found it a bit improper, yet Miriam gave her a gentle push through the doorway. "That's settled-Loretta and I are far too old to be staying up late.Good night."


Once she was nudged into Wesley's bedroom,Miriam and Loretta made their way toward the study to track down Wesley.


He had just stepped out of the shower, a faint curl of steam clinging to him as he worked a blow dryer through his damp hair.


The moment he spotted Loretta and Miriam entering together, a ripple of unease crossed his face.


"Grandma, Miriam-what brings you both here?"
###Chapter 68 Why Don't You Just Share It With Him

Loretta pulled Wesley straight out of bed, her voice clipped and urgent. "I went to see a fortune-teller. He says your bad luck's been running rampant lately.Step aside for a minute. I'm sprinkling holy water right now."


His damp hair clung to his forehead, stray droplets sliding down the line of his neck as she dragged him away. Suppressing a groan, he muttered, "It'sthe middle of the night, Grandma. Can't we do this tomorrow?"



Her tone left no room for argument. "Absolutely not.Once we start, we finish-and we finish tonight."


From the doorway, Miriam hurried in, clutching a massive basin brimming with holy water.


The thing was so full it sloshed with every step, forcing her to walk stiffly, swaying like she was balancing along a tightrope.
Concern flickered across Wesley's face, his brow drawing tight as he moved in. "Here, let me give you a hand."
Loretta instantly blocked him with an outstretched arm. "Don't touch a thing-stay out of the way!"
He could only retreat a step, letting the two women fuss over the task themselves.
That was when Miriam, having overfilled the basin,wobbled under its weight. The water sloshed violently, spilling across the bed in a sudden wave.
Flustered, Miriam blurted an apology. "Oh dear, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean for that to happen. This basin's far too heavy for an old woman like me to carry without spilling."
Wesley exhaled through his nose, his voice gentling."Are you hurt?"
Miriam shook her head with a quick smile. "I'm  perfectly fine." Loretta's eyes swept over the room with a solemn air,her voice low and certain. "Your bad luck is no joke this year. It was already terrible, and now it's doubled."
Without warning, she clapped her hands together, as though struck by divine revelation. "The fortune-teller warned you-no new beds until the year's over.You need to move back to your original room tonight."
Wesley gave a flat reply. "I sometimes crash in the study, or at the office."
He'd even slepot in hotel rooms while traveling for work.
"That was before!" Loretta shot back, narrowing her eyes. "Things have changed. Go sleep in the master bedroom!"
Wesley let out a slow sigh, shaking his head."Weren't you the one who insisted on giving my master bedroom to my secretary?"


"The bed's large enough for both of you to sleep on your own sides," Loretta said as if the mnatter were already settled. "Gabriela's a proper young woman.You're a full-grown man. Surely you're not worried she'll try something she shouldn't with you?"


Wesley shot her a wary look, confusion flickering in his eyes.


From the moment Loretta stepped in, she appeared intent on criticizing Gabriela at every turn, yet within mere hours, she and Miriam were suddenly united in opinion.


Wesley had no interest in deciphering whatever peculiar schemes played out in these two women's minds. Instead of engaging, he pushed open the study door and called to a passing servant, "Prepare a guest room."



"Understood, sir."


Their displeasure was evident in the tightness of Loretta's mouth and the narrowing of Miriam's eyes,but the servant worked quickly, readying the room in no time.



Both women followed Wesley inside like shadows unwilling to be shaken.


He regarded the pair with thinly veiled exasperation and said in a firm, non-negotiable tone, "I'm feeling a little worn out today and need some rest. Let's do the holy water tomorrow."


Loretta's spine stiffened, her tone brooking no refusal. "Absolutely not. This is a brand-new room with a brand-new bed. At the very least, I have to light a blessed candle and pray for peace."


Wesley found the whole thing absurd. To him, the biggest source of unrest in the house was Loretta and Miriam, not some unseen bad luck.


But Loretta had been steeped in superstition for as long as he could remember.


Wesley had grown up knowing that Loretta's faith in her superstitious little rites was unshakable, and after he'd narrowly escaped a brush with death, her devotion to them had only intensified. Every month without fail, she kept to a strict schedule of prayers and consultations, and if the slightest sign of bad luck appeared, she would go to extraordinary lengths to counter it on his behalf.


And he knew her well enough to understand that if she didn't carry out her ritual tonight, she'd toss and turn until dawn.


With a resigned breath, Wesley gave a reluctant nod."All right. But try not to make a mess this time."


Without missing a beat, Loretta swept in carrying three blessed candles.



She arranged them neatly beside the bed, murmured a solemn prayer, and whispered sacred words before striking a match and setting the wicks alight.


Everything went off without a hitch, prompting her to clap her hands with satisfaction. "That's it. All done." But Wesley's gut told him the night was far from over.


Sure enough, Miriam's shrill voice broke the moment."The blanket's on fire!"


The flames had only just licked across the fabric, not yet taking hold, and Wesley lunged for his coat to smother them.


Before he could, Loretta caught his arm. "These are blessed candles-you can't just snuff them out like that!"


In the next heartbeat, Miriam upended the basin of holy water, dousing both fire and bed in one dramatic splash.


The mattress sagged under the weight of the water,dripping onto the floor.


Wesley's patience frayed to its limit.


Still, he bit back his frustration, fixing both women with a tight-lipped stare as he endured their chaos in silence. Hearing the alarm about the fire, the servants swarmed in from every direction, eager to help douse the flames.
In moments, the hallway descended into a noisy scramble.
Gabriela, startled by the commotion, snatched a coat from the hook and hurried out.
A crowd of over a dozen people jammed the corridor,their faces tight with worry.
At the center of the commotion stood Wesley,draped in a black, robe-like pajama. His hair was still damp, dark strands falling over his eyes, and his expression radiated irritation.
A flicker of unease tightened Gabriela's chest."What happened?" she asked.
Loretta sidled up to her, looking utterly defeated, and lowered her voice. "The fortune-teller was right-Wesley's bad luck this year is worse than ever. First the bed in his study was soaked, and now the guest- room bed caught fire. He can't sleep on a new bed at all."


Wesley's gaze cut toward her, the corner of his mouth twitching. The sheer gall it took for Loretta to twist events like this made his eyes darken in mild,simmering exasperation.


Gabriela couldn't wrap her head around it. "How does a bed just catch fire out of nowhere?"


Was Wesley lighting up a cigarette or something? No,even if he did, he wasn't the type to be that reckless.


No one offered her an explanation.


Miriam, standing close by, muttered, "Poor Mr. Moss.Everyone else gets to relax during the holidays, but he's still buried in work. Spends his days locked in meetings and now doesn't even have a proper place to sleep."


At that, the situation finally clicked for Gabriela.


She turned to him and immediately insisted, "Mr.

Moss, why don't you just go back to your bedroom tonight? I can fix up a guest room and manage for the night."
Wesley's lip dipped in a curl, his expression growing even more darker.
"Not happening," Loretta cut Gabriela off without hesitation. "You're a guest here, and I'm not about to have you shuffling rooms in the middle of the night."
"But Mr. Moss.." Gabriela began, biting back the rest.

Wasn't he supposed to be avoiding any new rooms or beds because of al that ominous bad luck talk?
With a coaxing lilt, Loretta added, "Wesley's room is huge! Why don't you just share it with him?"
Gabriela's eyes widened as she countered,"Absolutely not. If it's that inconvenient, I'll just head home right now."

Wesley hadn't uttered a word, yet his expression was already set in a grim, unreadable mask. Was she really that unwilling to stay near him? Would she rather return to that oppressive house-the same one that could bolt its door in her face in the dead of night-than spend one evening in the same bed with him?



Loretta caught Gabriela by the wrist and drew her aside, lowering her voice to a hushed whisper. "Let me be straight with you-Wesley isn't into women.You're perfectly safe with him."



Her eyes glistened as she launched into an exaggerated sob. "Please, just do me this favor. Stay with him tonight. You can take the bed and let him sleep on the floor."



Gabriela stood there, stunned into silence.


She hadn't expected to learn that Wesley was not only a masochist but also gay. Bosses truly had their own baffling quirks!


And what kind of person would let him take the floor while she claimed the bed? She knew all too well that if Wesley spent the night on the rigid floor, she'd likely be unemployed by morning.
Loretta's casual disclosure of such an intimate secret feIt like someone had just handed Gabriela a ticking time bomb.
Knowing too much about her boss was dangerous.She was doomed.
Tears glistening in her eyes, Loretta leaned in, voice trembling as she pleaded, "I told you something incredibly important. You have to help me, all right?"
The question landed like a blade. Was that...a threat?Gabriela's chest tightened. She drew in a sharp breath,then nodded. "Fine. I'll do it."
What choice did she have? When Loretta begged with tears yet pressed with subtle menace, refusal wasn't on the table.
The master bedroom was spacious anyway; she could always sleep on the floor. The moment Gabriela agreed, Loretta lit up, seizing her hand and all but dragging her toward Wesley."Wesley," she announced with cheerful triumph."Gabriela's agreed to let you come back to the master bedroom. You two can share it tonight!"


A storm gathered instantly over Wesley's face.

 ###Chapter 69 He Cared For Her





Wesley's temper snapped like a dry twig.


Sensing his mood darken, Gabriela offered a gentle murmur. "Don't take it to heart. Your grandmother only means well."


The warmth in her voice slipped under his guard,making his chest tighten-and, perversely, stoking his irritation.


Unable to restrain himself, he hissed under his breath, "Fool!"


How could she give in so quickly on something like this? What if she ran into someone truly malicious?She'd be taken advantage of.


Realizing he disapproved of how she'd handled things, Gabriela kept her gaze lowered and her lips pressed shut, afraid to provoke him further.
 
Loretta, catching sight of Wesley's darkening expression and terrified Gabriela might bolt,dissolved into tears yet again. "Wesley, your mother left too soon, and I raised you under more pressure than you can imagine. Of course I want the boy l watched grow up to stay safe and sound. Now I'm only asking you to spend one night in the same room with Gabriela, and you turn me down? That's cruel.I see who you really are now. I'm so disappointed in you!"


A dull throb pulsed at Wesley's temples.


Gabriela stood frozen in shock.


Down the hall, the servants slipped away one by one,unwilling to be caught lingering over their employer's private affairs.


Only Miriam seemed to savor the scene, flashing Loretta a sly, triumphant thumbs-up.


Seeing Wesley tongue-tied, Loretta pressed on."You're a grown man, Wesley. Quit fussing and get back to your bedroom!" Without managing a single rebuttal, the usually imposing, self-possessed Wesley found himself herded toward his master bedroom by a storm of coaxing and scolding, punctuated by Loretta's tears and sharp reprimands.


The door slammed hard behind them, leaving Gabriela staring at Wesley's dark, unyielding expression, caught in a silence so awkward she didn't know where to look.


His gaze lingered on her, steady and searching. "Do you know..."


The truth was, he found himself falling fo her a little more with each moment.



Yet she didn't return his feelings-she'd once even mocked his long legs.


Sharing a room without any defined relationship-what kind of arrangement was this?


Sensing his mood had shifted for the better, Gabriela seized her chance. "You should take the bed tonight," she murmured warmly. "Don't worry.I'll be just fine. I've slept on floors more times than I can count, and I'm used to it."


Wesley's lips curved in a cold, mocking smile. "You really think I would let a woman sleep on the floor?"


Gabriela bit back any reply, deciding not to argue.


Pride was clearly at stake here-gay or not, Wesley wasn't about to let her trample over his sense of manhood.


If she kept pushing to sleep on the floor, she'd only be wounding that pride deeper.


But the thought of climbing into his bed left her uneasy.


So, in a cautious murmur, she offered, "Then...how about we both sleep in it? It's plenty big-we can stay on our own sides."


In her mind, with him being gay, there was nothing to worry about.Wesley's sharp eyes caught the exact calculation behind her offer.


She stood there like an employee negotiating with her boss-careful not to offend, unwilling to see him banished to the floor, yet too wary to outright challenge him.


Her indifference to sharing a bed-her utter disregard for him as a man-landed like a punch to the gut.


Fury surged, burning through his chest.


"Fine," he answered, his voice edged with frost.


With Wesley's agreement, Gabriela felt the tension leave her chest.



"I'm going to sleep. Good night," she murmured gently.


She'd nearly drifted off earlier, but the earlier commotion had roused her. Now, her body felt leaden with fatigue. She removed her coat and slipped under the covers, ready to let sleep take her. "Gabriela." Wesley's voice cut through the quiet,sharp with shock. "What in the world are you wearing?"


Last night's slip dress had already been scandalous enough-skimpy but at least not see-through.Tonight's clung to her like mist, the sheer fabric leaving little to the imagination.


The thin straps perched on her shoulders looked as if they'd give way with a careless tug.


A sudden, unwelcome heat coiled low in Wesley's abdomen.



Realization dawned on Gabriela, and she snatched her coat, fumbling to pull it back on.


"This slip dress came from Miriam. What's got you so worked up?" she muttered defensively.


She hadn't expected any trouble tonight, so the daring slip dress hadn't seemed like an issue. As Wesley's secretary, she wouldn't dare dig through his wardrobe for something else to wear. Who could've guessed it would turn into this? "Worked up or not, I wouldn't be into you," Wesley muttered through clenched teeth. "Go change."
Gabriela had nothing else to wear. The only option left was yesterday's curve-hugging gown-utterly unsuitable for sleeping.
Wesley realized that too. With a weary sigh, he disappeared into the walk-in closet and pulled open the wardrobe.
Everything inside belonged to him, including the robe he reached for.
At his six-foot-two frame, the robe could have swallowed two Gabrielas whole.
In the end, he came back with a crisp white shirt and handed it over.
Gabriela changed behind the closed closet door and emerged a moment later.
Wesley kept his gaze fixed elsewhere, his voice clipped as he ordered, "Get under the blanket and stay still. No moving around!"
The sharpness in his tone pricked at her pride.Gabriela was a bit offended. Gay or not, did he have to behave as if she was unbearable?
"Got it, Mr. Moss," she murmured, curling quickly beneath the covers.
Minutes ticked by, and still, Wesley hadn't climbed into bed.
Gabriela, ever unbothered, drifted toward sleep,her lashes lowering in lazy blinks until her eyes shut completely.
Only after his pulse steadied did Wesley finally slip into bed.
Gabriela was already out cold, her breathing deep and even, utterly oblivious as he eased down beside her.
She lay there in perfect stillness, face serene. With a twinge of disappointment, they slid the lock into place.


"Do you think this will actually work?" Loretta whispered, doubt creeping into her voice.


She had expected at least some evidence of the fiery scene Miriam had so confidently predicted.


Miriam, undeterred, lowered her voice but spoke with conviction. "Gabriela is stunning-flawless figure,gorgeous face. If Wesley can spend an entire night in the same bed with her and still keep his hands to himself, then there's only one explanation..."


She let the implication hang, the unspoken conclusion clear-he was truly gay.


That possibility turned Loretta pale. She swallowed hard, clinging to the fragile hope that everything would unfold as planned.







Morning arrived in a wash of soft light. Gabriela woke up from the most peaceful sleep, her
lashes fluttering open-only to freeze at the sight before her.
A sharp gasp caught in her throat, and she snapped
her eyes shut, heart thudding. When she dared to peek again, the image remained.
Wesley lay beside her, one arm draped around her in a loose, protective hold.
To her relief, he hadn't wNoken.
Gabriela's initial wave of relief dwindled quickly,replaced by a restless curiosity that had her sneaking in a few more covert glances at Wesley.
Waking up cradled in the arms of her crush was a rare luxury-one most employees could only dream about.
His embrace radiated a steady warmth, his scent a subtle mix of sandalwood and something darker,more intoxicating.
Even in sleep, his sharply cut features looked effortlessly handsome, his lips pressed in a faint,alluring pout.
What a man-gorgeous to the point of being unreal.Such a shame he was supposedly gay.
Gabriela started to shift, ready to slip away,when her body went rigid, and her eyes snapped shut.
Wait a second! Hadn't Loretta insisted Wesley wasn't into women?
Then why could she suddenly feel the hard heat of his arousal pressed against her?
Her lashes stayed clamped together, every muscle strung tight as she held her breath, pretending to still be asleep.
###Chapter 70 He Shouldn't Be The Only One Uncomfortable

Gabriela felt as though she could barely catch her breath,nearly overwhelmed by how close she was to Wesley.
Why was he still rock-hard against her?
Was he awake?
If he realized she was nestled so snugly against him,would he be upset?
Wesley was, in fact, fully awake.
The slightest shift from Gabriela snapped him to attention.
A twinge of irritation flickered within him.
It was early morning, and the woman he cherished was wrapped in his arms-how could he possibly remain unaffected?
His body burned with intensity, yet he held himself still, wary of alarming Gabriela. He planned to feign sleep, hoping she would slipaway first, but she stayed put.
Now, with his physical reaction impossible to hide,she seemed too nervous to move, as if she were suffocating under the weight of the moment.
Wesley, both frustrated and self-conscious, spoke with measured calm. "Have you forgotten how to breathe? Open your eyes."
His tone was cool, but it carried the rough edge of someone freshly roused from sleep, making the moment feel even more intimate.
Gabriela, still pretending to be asleep, refused to open her eyes.
"Don't you care about your paycheck?"
That sentence got her attention. Her eyes flew open instantly.
earn everywhere. She tilted her head up, meeting Wesley's intense,deep-set gaze.


Her cheeks flushed crimnson as she played dumb,acting as if she had just stirred awake. "Morning, Mr.Moss."


"Morning," he replied, a faint smirk tugging at his lips. "Didn't you say sleeping on opposite sides of the bed wouId work out fine? Care to explain this?"


Petite as she was, Gabriela had curled up completely within Wesley's embrace.


With any other man, this might have spelled trouble.


Her attempt to brush it off didn't fool him, and at his words, her face grew even redder. With a playful tone, she shot back, "Mr. Moss, if I said I might have a sleepwalking problem, would you buy it?"


Wesley didn't respond to her quip. Instead, he said,"Get up, freshen up, and figure out how you're going to justify this to me."


Gabriela scrambled to her feet and bolted to the bathroom, her heart racing.


She was flustered.


Wesley seemed so stern-did accidentally ending up in his armns really warrant an explanation?


Watching her dart away, Wesley let out a soft chuckle.


The master bedroom's bed was enormous, spanning four meters, plenty of space for two to sleep far apart.


Last night, after lying down, he had tried to force himself to sleep immediately.


But the subtle scent beside him enveloped him,setting his pulse racing.


He tossed and turned, barely sleeping a wink.


Making her a little anxious and flustered felt fair-he shouldn't be the only one uncomfortable.


Wesley rose, planning to leave the room and find another bathroom to shower. But the door wouldn't open.


Recalling Loretta and Miriam's meddling from the night before, he pieced together their scheme and chuckled quietly.


Today,he realized just how charming Gabriela was.In just two days at the estate, she had completely won over his housekeeper and grandmother.


When Gabriela emerged, dressed and composed,Wesley informed her, "The door is locked from the outside. I've called my grandmother-she will come and unlock it."


Without waiting for her reply, he stepped into the bathroom.


Soon after, Loretta and Miriam arrived to open the door.


Loretta had a restless night, and when Wesley's call came, she rushed over to see what had unfolded.


Seeing Gabriela already dressed, she felt a pang of disappointment. "Gabriela, did anything happen between you and Wesley last night?"


Gabriela's expression faltered, a touch awkward."Everything was fine. The bed is huge, and we each kept to our own side without disturbing each other."


She didn't dare admit she had ended up curled in Wesley's arms.


Miriam's eyes widened. "You two shared a bed?"


Gabriela's ears turned scarlet as she insisted, "It's an enormous bed! We weren't even within arm's reach of each other!"


Loretta and Miriam exchanged a look.


Miriam kept scanning Gabriela's neck for any telltale marks,but found none.


What the hell! They had slept in the same bed, and nothing had happened.


Was it possible that Wesley really had no interest in women?


Gabriela sensed Loretta's and Miriam's disappointment but didn't know how to comfort them.


"Mrs. Larson, Miriam, shall we head downstairs?" she suggested, hoping to escape the awkwardness before Wesley finished his shower.


Loretta and Miriam, visibly deflated, followed her out of the master bedroom.



When Wesley emerged from the bathroom and entered the walk-in closet, he chose a shirt, vest, tie,and watch, dressing with care before slipping into his suit.



He usually worked from home in casual clothes,but today, for some reason, he felt the need to dress sharply.


Perhaps it was to reassert some authority in Gabriela's eyes.


As Wesley descended the stairs, Gabriela's gaze immediately found him.


Now fully dressed, he exuded his usual distant, unapproachable air.


She said briskly, "Mr. Moss, I apologize for the inconvenience these past two days. I would like to head home now."


She hoped her polite request would spare her from explaining herearlier actions.


Wesley's lips quirked slightly.


Despite the morning's unexpected events leaving him a bit irritated, deep down, he wanted her to stay.He enjoyed her presence.


"Which home?" he asked with a scoff. "The one where they locked you out at night?"


Gabriela hesitated, then met his gaze firmly. "Yes,that's my home-the house my mother left me.I'll reclaim it one day, no matter what."


In the future, no one would dare bar her from her own home again.


The usually reserved Gabriela had a spark of determination in her eyes as she spoke of taking back her house.
Wesley was certain she could do it.
Having grown up in tough circumstances, she had still emerged vibrant and optimistic.
Nothing could stand in her way.
"Is your foot better?" he asked, his tone detached.
Hearing his cool voice, Gabriela replied quickly, "It's
fine now. I can even wear heels."
Even if it still ached; she wouldn't admit it-Wesley would only lecture her again.
"I'll have my driver drive you home," Wesley said.
Gabriela almost declined, but knowing his temperament, she nodded and thanked him.
Their conversation flowed smoothly, but it left Loretta and Miriam uneasy.
"Come on!" Loretta interjected urgently. "Wesley,
Gabriela is a guest-you can't just send her off the moment she's up. At least let her have breakfast first."


Miriam chimed in, "I'll have the kitchen prepare it."


She hurried off to the kitchen in a flash.


Gabriela had no choice but to stay.


She resolved to leave right after breakfast,determined not to linger.


But things did not unfold as she expected.


After a quick breakfast, Loretta mentioned the onions she had brought and asked Gabriela to help dry them in the sun.


Wesley, catching onto Miriam's matchmaking,said with a sigh, "Grandma, Gabriela is on vacation. You shouldn't be giving her tasks."


Loretta, unimpressed, was about to scold him again.


"Mr. Moss, it's fine," Gabriela cut in quickly,worried Loretta might get upset. "It's just a small favor, no  trouble at all."



After drying the onions, Loretta produced a stack of gift boxes, handing them to Gabriela to help assemble.



Each one would be given as a New Year present to the estate's staff as a small token of appreciation.


Gabriela was stunned- she had never seen a family give gifts to their servants before.


How many staff did the manor have? How much would it cost to prepare all those gifts?


For a fleeting moment, Gabriela reasoned that if she shamelessly stayed for New Year's, perhaps she would get a gift too.


Surely Wesley wouldn't mind adding one more,right?
###Chapter 71 Staying To Cook For Wesley
Miriam's gaze brightened the moment she caught Gabriela's hesitation.


Everyone had an Achiles' heel.


Gabriela had always seemed untouchable, flawless in poise and charm, and Miriam had been racking her brain for a way to keep her close. Inviting her to help pack gifts had been nothing more than a delaying tactic.



So, Gabriela had a soft spot for lavish gifts?Excellent. A refreshingly uncomplicated desire.


Her eyes gleaming,Miriam cleared her throat. "These here are just Mr. Moss's gifts for the staff. Loretta's here for New Year's, so she'll be giving out gifts too,"she said casually.


Noticing Gabriela's ears practically perk up, Miriam pressed on. "I'll hand out mine too."


Gabriela could hardly contain her delight-the three of them would distribute gifts separately.


How could she not love that?


Loretta wasn't slow on the uptake. She chimed in at once, "Exactly. My gifts are reserved for those who spend New Year's here."


Gabriela's pulse quickened, her chest alight with giddy anticipation.


This family was obscenely rich.


One glance at Gabriela's spark-filled eyes, and Miriam was already hatching a fresh scheme to keep her anchored here.


While Gabriela busied herself packing those gifts,Miriam leaned toward Loretta, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial murmur.


After last night's failed scheme, Loretta's expression was wary. "You really think this will work?" she asked. "Of course it will!" Miriam said with confidence."Gabriela's got real feelings for Wesley. You just jumped the gun yesterday, and it spooked her into thinking she should leave."


Loretta discreetly rolled her eyes. That ridiculous stunt had been Miriam's brainchild, yet here she was,pinning the blame elsewhere.


"Just follow my lead," Miriam said. "This time, we make sure she stays. Feelings need time to grow too.Push too hard and they wilt."


Loretta held her tongue. Right now, getting Wesley to open his heart mattered more than picking a fight.


"Fine," she said at last. "But this is the last time I'm trusting you."



Before long, Gabriela had neatly finished packing every last gift.


Loretta glanced at the grand clock dominating the wall, then clapped her hands in feigned surprise."Is it that late already? I'll cook today. Gabriela, stay and have lunch before you leave."


Gabriela followed her gaze to the clock.


Ten o'clock sharp. Lunch? Now?


"Well, I..." She opened her mouth, but hesitated.


Those gifts were tempting, but another day here might only push Wesley's patience further.


Her well-paying job was worth far more in the long run than any lavish gift.


"After lunch, can I head straight back?" Gabriela asked.



"Of course," Miriam replied at once, her tone smooth.

"Once you're done eating, Mr. Moss's driver will drive you home."


Soon, Loretta set the last dish on the table, and lunch was ready.


When Wesley stepped out of his study and spotted Gabriela still lingering at the estate, his brows lifted in mild surprise, then curved in faint amusement. Whatever scheme Loretta and Miriam were brewing this time, he was almost curious enough to play along.


But the moment he sat down, his expression shifted.


The spread before him was a parade of everything he disliked.



Front and center: a daunting platter of onion purée-easily six onions pulverized into a single mound.


To his left: celery stir-fried with beef.


To his right: steamed fish blanketed in cilantro.


Braised ribs, which was the one dish he actually enjoyed, had been banished to the far end ofthe table, drowning under a tide of fiery chili peppers.


Even the tomato soup had not escaped;it,too,swam with onions.



Wesley's brow furrowed. "Did we change chefs today, Miriam?" he asked.


She gave a breezy laugh. "The chefs went home for the New Year. Your grandmother decided she'd do the cooking."


Loretta ignored his reaction, deftly lifting a rib and setting it on his plate. "Please, try some of my cooking."


Miriam's eyes, however, were fixed on Gabriela.


And right on cue, Gabriela spoke up before Wesley could. "Mr. Moss has a weak heart. He shouldn't eat anything that spicy."


Loretta silently retrieved the rib from his plate,replacing it with onions and meat instead. "Then eat this," she said matter-of-factly. "Onions are good for the heart."


Wesley was at a loss for words.


Loretta knew his tastes by heart, so why was there not a single dish on the table he actually enjoyed?


He was certain he hadn't done anything to warrant her displeasure. What was she up to this time?


"Go on, try it," Loretta said.


Catching the slight pause in Wesley's movements and fully aware of his aversion to certain foods,Gabriela cut in, "Mr. Moss can't stand onions. They make him queasy."


Loretta's brows lifted in genuine surprise. "Really?And how would you know that?"


"I occasionally take a part-time role at the company,making his lunch," Gabriela replied evenly.


Loretta shot Miriam a quick look, a flicker of something unspoken passing between them, before she said with a hint of reproach,"You're coddling him too much. A man shouldn't be spoiled. If spicy food is off the table because of his heart, then these are exactly what he should eat."


Without giving WVesley a chance to object, she scooped a generous mound of onions and celery onto his plate. "I put a lot of effort into making this meal. You're a grown man, still fussing like a child over vegetables. And you think you have the right to sulk?"



Her sharp tone was nothing he couldn't ignore. But staring down a plate piled high with onions, celery,and cilantro? That was another matter entirely. His jaw tightened, and a storm settled in his eyes.


When Wesley made no move to eat, Loretta let out a sharp huff. "Eat them or don't, but don't expect me to whip up anything else."


Wesley wasn't about to spar with her over a single meal. Setting down his fork, he leaned back in his chair, meeting her gaze with quiet composure.


At the company, Gabriela had long been accustomed to smoothing over his moods. Catching the faint tension in his expression, she stepped in. "How about I make something else for Mr.Moss?"


Loretta's mouth tightened, clearly unhappy with the offer, but she relented. "You're a guest, but if you insist... Oh, and keep it mild. Wesley can't have anything too salty."


In no time, Gabriela prepared a fragrant borscht with no onions and a perfectly braised carp.


It had been days since Wesley had tasted her cooking, and the moment he did, his mood lightened noticeably.


Loretta and Miriam each sampled the food and exchanged impressed looks, declaring it better than a professional chef's.


Once Wesley's plate was nearly empty, Loretta leaned forward. "Gabriela, since you're free over the holidays, why not stay here and work part-time? You wouldn't have to do anything except cook for Wesley."


Gabriela froze, caught off guard. "But..."


She was supposed to be on vacation. The idea of spending it under her boss's roof, constantly catering to his preferences, was hardly appealing.


Loretta said matter-of-factly, "He's clearly used to your cooking. Look how much he enjoyed it today.You should stay."


Wesley's brows arched ever so slightly.


This time, Loretta had a point.


Having Gabriela's cooking every day through the holidays would be a luxury worth keeping.


Sensing Gabriela's reluctance, Loretta asked, "How much do you make per day cooking for Wesley at the company?"


Gabriela faltered.



The truth was, she'd never been paid for it. She'd only taken on the role to repay that outrageously expensive women's suit, and along the way, had become his unpaid taste tester and grocery runner.


For all her twenty-eight-thousand-dollar monthly salary, it wasn't exactly easy money.


"Well," Loretta said, "| suppose we should give you more than your usual rate. I'll offer three thousand a day.How about that?"


She had no idea what white-collar wages looked like these days, but figured a graduate student shouldn't be offered too little.


Gabriela had been rehearsing her polite refusal, until that number hit her.


Three thousand! A day? Oh, she could live with that.


At that rate, she might just sign up to be Wesley's personal chef until the end of time.


Her eyes lit despite her best efforts to stay composed. Leaning toward him, she asked, voice tinged with anticipation, "Mr. Moss, do you think your grandmother's offer is workable?"


Wesley, catching every flicker of calculation behind her gaze, found her enthusiasm faintly entertaining.With the kind of smooth ease that came naturally to him,he replied, "Of course."
###Chapter 72 Her Taste In Men Was Terrible
"With me here, you'll be eating delicious, satisfying meals every single day, Mr. Moss," Gabriela promised.


She was thrilled to snag a part-time job that paid three thousand a day.


Loretta and Miriam, pleased to have found a reason to keep her close, secretly rejoiced at the thought that Wesley might finally find himself a girlfriend.Their satisfaction showed in their smniles.


Even Wesley's expression softened with quiet contentment.


That calm shifted the moment Brenden stepped foot in the manor.


By early evening, he arrived with two oversized boxes of gifts in hand, trailing after Loretta into the house. Spotting Wesley lounging on the sofa, Brenden greeted him with an easy grin. "Wesley, a friend of mine grows these strawberries-just picked today.I brought you two boxes."


"Strawberries aren't my thing." Wesley's tone turned glacial. "Take them back."


Brenden froze, caught off guard.


Earlier that year, his mother had begun dating a new man and, brimming with excitement, traveled overseas with him-leaving Brenden rattling around the house alone.


The loneliness had been unbearable. He'd planned to spend New Year's tucked away in the countryside with Loretta. However, once he found out that she was staying at Wesley's place, he had no choice but to follow.


"Fine, if you won't have any, Gabriela and I will take care of them!" Loretta cut in, her patience for Wesley's stubbornness wearing thin. Since discovering his maddening obstinance in matters ofthe heart, she'd found him especially exasperating these past few days. She shot him a sharp, warning look before softening her voice for Brenden.


"Why are you so skinny? Did life in Afluena treat you that badly?" she asked, her gaze warm with concern.


Brenden gave a confident grin. "No, I did fine in Afluena-I'm just sun-kissed. In fact, the tan makes me even more irresistible. There's even a pretty girl pining for me in secret lately."


Wesley didn't bother indulging in Brenden's boast.Without a word, he turned away, his face as cold as winter stone.



Gabriela had mentioned the orchids blooming in the back garden, and he decided a quiet stroll among them might ease his foul mood.


Oblivious to the fact that Wesley wanted no company, Brenden jogged after him. "Wesley, hold up!"he called.


By the time Wesley reached the garden path, Brenden had already cut him off. His brows pulled together in sharp impatience."What now?"


"The other night at the Deluxe Hotel," Brenden began, "I almost put Gabriela in an awkward spot.You stepped in just in time to save her. I never got the chance to thank you." His tone softened with a touch of admiration. "Honestly, I didn't thinkyou had it in you. You played the part so well, I nearly believed you really were her boyfriend."


Wesley leveled him with a glare sharp enough to cut glass.


What on earth made Brenden think he'd been putting on a show?


Feeling the frost roll off Wesley's dark eyes, Brenden managed an awkward laugh and said, "Seriously,Wesley, I mean it-thank you. I messed up and hurt Gabriela's feelings. If you hadn't stepped in, she would've been humiliated."


Meanwhile, Gabriela was out in the back garden with Miriam, crouching near a bed of orchids to snap photos.


The pot in bloom was worth fifteen million dollars-practically the price of a luxury home.


Miriam, a social media devotee, was already picturing the perfect post for her followers.


Loretta had no interest in such things, so Miriam had happily roped Gabriela into keeping her company.


They had just taken a handful of shots when Brenden's voice drifted over, carried by the late afternoon breeze.



Gabriela went rigid.


Deep down, she knew Wesley had only shown up because Brenden had summoned him, yet Brenden had never confirmed it over WhatsApp. That tiny omission had let her cling to the foolish hope that Wesley might have stepped in for her sake alone.


Now, reality pressed in-she had been imagining things. A man of his standing wouldn't pose as a subordinate's boyfriend without a very deliberate reason.


"What's caught your eye, Gabriela?" Miriam followed the direction of her gaze, then smiled knowingly. "Ah,that's Mr. Brenden Saunders-Mr. Moss's cousin.Mr.Saunders is part of Mr. Moss's company as well. Do you happen to know him?"


Gabriela gave a nod. "Yes,we've met."


Their exchange drew Brenden's attention, and he strode over with a surprised grin. "Gabriela? What brings you here?"


Before she could answer, Wesley's cold gaze sliced into the moment. "Is there a problem?"


"Not at all. In fact, I'm glad to see her." Brenden's smile faltered as he leaned in toward Wesley,lowering his voice until Gabriela couldn't catch the words. "Wesley, truth is... I like Gabriela too. If l'd known her feelings for me, I'd never have treated her that way at the hotel." Wesley's mouth curved into a frosty smirk, his eyes narrowing on Brenden with a hard, unblinking stare.


Since when had Gabriela ever shown any interest in Brenden?



His mind flicked back to the time she'd casually mentioned her dislike for overly tall men. Brenden might not match his height, but he still towered well above her petite frame.


This was the kind of man she'd choose? Seriously?


The more Wesley mulled it over, the tighter his jaw became. A cold weight settled in his chest, and he sent Gabriela a look sharp enough to cut.


Across the garden, Gabriela was crouched beside Miriam, adjusting the angle for a photo. The moment Wesley's icy glare landed on her, her fingers twitched, and she almost dropped her phone.


A nervous chilI rippled through her. Why on earth was Wesley suddenly looking at her like that?


Was Brenden talking about their one-night stand? Damn, if that was the case, would her brand-new part-time job-three thousand a day-go up in smoke?



The question flickered across Gabriela's mind,tightening her expression. Wesley, catching the shift,lost all interest in admiring the orchids and strode back toward the house.



Wanting to earn some points, Gabriela passed Miriam's phone back with a polite smile. "It's getting late-I should start on dinner."



Miriam didn't object, happily keeping Brenden by her side for the photo session.


Gabriela hurried after Wesley, softening her tone in an attempt to please him. "Mr. Moss, the orchids have bloomed. They're stunning-don't you want to take a look?"


The flowers, after all, were worth a fortune and proudly kept on the manor grounds.


Was he impressed by them? Perhaps he should invite some friends over to appreciate those flowers.


"What's there to see?" Wesley's voice cut through the air, cold and sharp. "A man shorter than me?"


Gabriela blinked, caught off guard.


Sure, Brenden was shorter than him, but did he have to bring it up like that?


For someone usually so composed, Wesley seemed ridiculously touchy; even height could get under his skin.



Trying to steer the conversation away from his prickly mood, she offered with a tentative smile. "I'm making barbecue ribs and chicken tonight, with a side of corn chowder.Would you be up for that, Mr. Moss?"


Wesley's gaze swept over her, cool and appraising.


She was perceptive, well-educated, and sharp-minded and could hold her own in the kitchen-yet her taste in men was terrible. The longer he looked, the more his irritation simmered, until he turned away without a word,lengthening his stride.


Gabriela had to half-jog to match his pace.


But he headed straight into the study and shut the door with a firm click, leaving her in the hallway.


With no chnoice, she made her way to the kitchen,determined to win him over with a dinner that might soften his mood.


Out in the back garden, Brenden couldn't hide his curiosity about why Gabriela was spending her vacation at Wesley's house instead of relaxing somewhere else.



Miriam gave a breezy explanation. "She's picking up a holiday side job-making sure Mr. Moss gets proper meals while he's on break."


The revelation caught Brenden off guard.


Gabriela cooked for Wesley during her time off? An unexpected thought crept in. Could it be... because of him?


His mind ran circles around the idea. Maybe she liked him so much she'd taken the job just to be near him.


A flush crept up Brenden's ears, his pulse kicking up.


Could she really be that into himn?
###Chapter 73 Don't Give Her The Wrong Idea
Miriam's eyes narrowed as she watched Brenden's face flush for no clear reason. "You're burning up! Do you have a fever?" she asked.


Brenden shook his head, forcing a calm tone. "It's the wind. It's too strong. I'm heading back inside.And the photos I took of these lovely flowers should be more than enough." With that, he handed her the phone back.


Miriam took the phone, scrolling through the photos and arranging them for posting.


Today, these extraordinary flowers would surely make her friends green with envy.


But what caption would hit just right?


"Flowers worth a mansion... So stunning, you'll be speechless!" She paused, scrunched her face, and deleted it. Too flashy. Too desperate. She needed subtle, but with a punch.


Suddenly, a grin spread across her face. Fingers flying over the screen, she posted: "Captured by Mr.Moss's future wife herself. More priceless than the flowers."


Loretta, still a rookie at scrolling through social media, quickly liked the post and made sure Wesley did too.







Brenden slipped back into the living room,moving on tiptoe toward the kitchen door where the faint sounds of bustling activity drifted out. A mix of joy and guilt churned inside him.


Gabriela was incredible! How could someone like her ever be interested in a playboy like him?


Sometimes, being charming came with complications. Loretta, busy arranging the strawberries, caught snippets of Brenden muttering under his breath. She couldn't make out his words, but the expression on his face was a curious mix. Sometimes pained, as if he'd just lost a fortune, other times shy, a small smile tugging at his lips as he leaned against the wall.


Something seemed off.


Stepping closer, Loretta patted his shoulder."Brenden, the sun's almost gone. Come help me gather the green onions."


Immediately, Brenden straightened, composure returning, and followed her outside.


Once there, he worked methodically, helping to gather the green onions and carefully trimming away the dried leaves.



Loretta stood back, quietly observing him, noting each careful motion.



"Why don't you stay a few more days? Keep me company, and I'll cook all your favorite meals," she  Wrong Idea said,her tone warm.


"Sure!" Brenden replied casually, but a flicker of worry crossed his face.


Spending more time with Gabriela was tempting, yes,but also dangerous. The longer he lingered around her,the harder it might be for her to walk away.


Brenden couldn't help but sigh, feeling sure that his charm had made Gabriela fall deeply in love with him.


Loretta, noticing the peculiar expression twisting his face, frowned. "Is something bothering you lately?Tell me-I'll help,I promise."


"You're so kind, Loretta," Brenden said, touched for a brief moment, before the weight of his thoughts spilled out. "There's this wonderfu girl who likes me... a lot. But I already have a girlfriend, and I don't want to hurt her feelings. What do you think I should do?"


Loretta studied him carefully, skepticism etched across her face. Brenden's taste in women was questionable, and he was constantly surrounded by gold-diggers clamoring for designer bags and expensive jewelry.


Could a genuinely decent girl really be interested in him?



Loretta gave a casual shrug. "What's so difficult about that? Just keep your distance. Don't give her the wrong idea, and with time, it'll sort itself out."


A pang struck Brenden's chest.


Was that really the only way forward? He felt an uncomfortable reluctance settle over him.



Not ready to give up, he pressed on. "How long has Gabriela been working here part-time? Do you know her well? Between Fiona and Gabriela, who's better?"


Without hesitation, Loretta replied, "Gabriela, of course."



Brenden leaned in, curious. "Why?"


As if the answer were obvious, Loretta listed off her reasons."Gabriela is prettier, better educated, brings good fortune to Wesley, and she's capable with a calm, pleasant temperament."


Most importantly, she was the only one who could soften Wesley's cold heart.


Brenden's chest swelled with pride. "I thought so too."



Loretta, however, couldn't shake the uneasy feeling that something about Brenden's reaction was unusual.


Why did he swell with pride when she praised Gabriela?


And what had he been so troubled about earlier,wearing such a conflicted expression-as if wrestling with some difficult choice?


Loretta kept her observations to herself, turning instead to the kitchen. She decided to cook something for him.


In the kitchen, Gabriela was busy putting the finishing touches on the soup. She looked up as Loretta entered and rolled up her sleeves. "You should take a break. There's no need to help. Lunch will be ready soon," she said with a gentle smile.


"I'm making something for Brenden," Loretta replied,just as a servant brought in a bag of fresh ingredients.


The moment Brenden's name was mentioned,Gabriela's stomach tightened.


The next second, Loretta pulled out several portions of pollack from the bag.


As she busied herself in the kitchen preparing the dish for Brenden, he was lounging on the sofa,reading Renee's text.


"I miss you so much, darling. Why haven't you replied? Are you hiding something from me? If I don't hear back in ten minutes, you'll owe me a handbag tomorrow and an all-night cuddle when we sleep."


The usual flirtatious banter, which once thrilled him, now felt hollow to Brenden.


He texted back. "Miss you to0."


Bored, he tossed his phone aside just as Gabriela's voice rang out. "Dinner's ready!"


His heart skipped. Her words somehow carried more weight than a hundred of Renee's declarations of love.


Gabriela set the dishes on the table, then noticed Wesley hadn't emerged. She hurried to his study and knocked gently.


"Come in," came a cool, measured voice from within.


She pushed the door open.


The study was immense, shelves towering like a private library.


Everything gleamed with order. Spacious,immaculate and every detail reflecting Wesley's meticulous nature.


He wasn't at his desk, but reclining in a chair, absorbed in a book.


A light gray vest over his shirt, a thick tome in hand,he looked effortlessly captivating.


Gabriela lowered her gaze, and said with quiet respect, "Dinner's ready, Mr. Moss."


Wesley closed his book, rose from his chair,and replied smoothly, "Alright,let's go."


Outside, Brenden was already seated, lounging as if he owned the place. It was familiar display of his usual careless charm whenever he visited the estate.


Before him lay a plate of classic BBQ ribs, glistening and fragrant, the kind of dish that made his stomach ache with anticipation.


Had Gabriela prepared this knowing it was his favorite?



Just as he lifted his fork, ready to dig in, the ribs were replaced with a new dish.


"You're eating this tonight," Loretta declared. "This... what is this?" Brenden asked in confusion.


Loretta sat down beside him, a faint smirk playing on her lips. "It's fish. Are you blind, stupid boy?"


Brenden felt a surge of frustration. Why was he being scolded for this?



"What's with that face?" Loretta frowned. "I put thought and effort into this, and you turn your nose up at it?"


Brenden grimaced. He couldn't stand the stuff; even the aroma made his stomach churn.



"Wesley knows you've been overworking yourself lately," Loretta continued. "And he suggested you have this for three days straight. Even if he's strict sometimes, when he shows kindness, you should appreciate it."


Brenden felt a flicker of warmth and glanced at Wesley.


He had no idea Wesley cared so much. Wesley,however, remained perfectly unreadable, his expression fixed and calm.


Mustering all his willpower, Brenden dove in and finished the entire plate of fish.


Gabriela, watching quietly from the side, couldn't hide her surprise.


Each chew looked painful, yet he managed to clear his plate.







In the quiet elegance of Rosemont Gardens, Marie's voice carried a sharp edge as she scolded Phyllis."You idiot! Even if Gabriela's boyfriend really is Brenden, you had no business inviting him there. Do you even know who Brenden is? He's Wesley's cousin!"


Phyllis, eyes flashing with defiance, shot back,"Vivian said Brenden's a notorious playboy, with girlfriends so many he can't even remember their names." She assumed Gabriela's connection to him meant little.


"So what?" Marie snapped, her patience wearing thin. "Reputation or not, Wesley treats him like a brother and protects him. That alone makes him magnetic to everyone in the circle. And look what you've done! Not only did you fail to embarrass Gabriela, you've insulted Wesley. Gabriela's at his place right now, probably scheming how to get back at you."


Phyllis felt a flicker of fear, but it was drowned out by envy. "I'm not afraid of her!" she declared. "If she tries anything, I'll make sure no one walks away unscathed."
 ###Chapter 74 Let's Orchestrate Something Spectacular
Phyllis's face contorted with rage, her features twisted into something almost unrecognizable.


Marie studied her daughter's pathetic expression and felt fury surge through her veins.


She had spent countless days drilling the same lesson into Phyllis's thick skull-cunning was acceptable, even admirable, but stupidity was unforgivable. Yet this girl remained hopelessly dense.


"You should stay away from Vivian," Marie snapped,her voice cutting through the air like a blade. "She orchestrated Brenden's dramatic entrance at your wedding, and even if chaos followed, she would walk away unscathed. Her brother runs the Vasquez Group empire. We're nobodies compared to them.Why do you think she wastes time with you? Because your foolishness makes you the perfect puppet." 
Marie's words gained momentum, each one sharper than the last. "We had our chance with Gabriela and we botched it completely. Now she has Mr. Moss's protection, so swallow your wounded pride and learn from your mistakes!"


Marie stared at her daughter, a crushing wave of disappointment settling in her chest. How could she be so stupid?



Even Gabriela possessed the intelligence to align herself with power, while Phyllis had stolen her worthless boyfriend and strutted around like she'd won some grand prize. The sheer stupidity made Marie's blood boil.


Marie's harsh criticism struck deep, and Phyllis bristled with defiant indignation. She opened her mouth to deliver a cutting response when Josh's footsteps echoed through the hallway before he appeared in the study doorway.


Marie's demeanor shifted instantly. "Leave us," she commanded Phyllis with cold authority. Phyllis offered a curt nod and retreated toward the exit, her movements stiff with barely contained resentment.


As her hand touched the door handle, she allowed it to remain slightly open-just enough to catch fragments of the conversation within.


The moment Phyllis disappeared, Josh's stern expression melted away, replaced by a warm smile directed at his wife. "Gabriela called earlier," he announced, settling into his favorite chair. "She won't be joining us for New Year's this year."


Marie's heart plummeted like a stone dropped into dark water.


If Gabriela chose to spend the holidays elsewhere,it confirmed what Marie had feared-Wesley treasured her deeply.


"Mr. Moss may be Gabriela's boyfriend, but they haven't exchanged vows yet," Marie ventured carefully, adopting the concerned maternal tone."Living together so openly seems rather improper.

 Perhaps she should return home where she belongs."





Marie had perfected this role over the years-the responsible guardian who worried about Gabriela.


Josh's laughter rippled through the room,warm and genuine. "There's nothing to worry about. Gabriela explained that Mr. Moss owns an enormous estate,complete with more than a dozen staff members and numerous guest quarters."


He practically glowed with satisfaction over Gabriela's romantic fortune. Wesley possessed both substantial wealth and refined manners-a combination that seemed almost too perfect to be real.


With Josh speaking so enthusiastically about the arrangement, Marie found herself trapped without room for further argument.


Josh's mind wandered to a promise he had made to Gabriela not long ago, and inspiration struck him.Now seemed like the ideal moment to bring it up. "Marie," he began thoughtfully, his fingers drumming against the desk, "We moved into this house originally to care for Gabriela, just as I promised my sister. Sixteen years have passed since then, and Gabriela has blossomed into a capable young woman. The time has comne to return this property to its rightful owner."


Marie's face transformed into stone, her features hardening as shadows seemed to gather around her."What exactly are you suggesting?"


She had grown intoxicated by the luxury of their sprawling villa. The thought of cramming herself into some modest apartment made her stomach turn with revulsion.


Josh recognized the battle ahead would require patience and diplomacy, so he chose his words with deliberate care. "When my sister was dying, she gave us money to clear your gambling debts. We must conduct ourselves with honor and integrity..."


"What are you implying?" Marie's voice exploded through the study, her interruption sharp enough to cut glass. Her eyes blazed with crimson fury. "Your sister did provide money, but we've been supporting Gabriela for sixteen years straight. Doesn't that count for something? You bury yourself in dusty books and fancy yourself some kind of philosopher,completely divorced from reality. Do you have any comprehension of how expensive it is to raise a child?"



"Please calm yourself," Josh murmured, his voice shrinking as it always did when Marie's temper flared. He offered gentle reassurance like a man trying to soothe a wild animal. "You've been managing the company brilliantly all these years and must have accumulated substantial savings.We can purchase another villa once we vacate this one."



Marie's lips curved into something that might have been a smile if not for the bitterness that poisoned it,her expression growing more thunderous by the second.

Before taking control of Haynes Group, she had harbored a destructive addiction-gambling consumed her like a disease.


Sixteen years earlier, she had accumulated gambling debts exceeding three hundred thousand dollars, a crushing burden that Gabriela's mother had paid in full before her death. Then Gabriela's mother entrusted both the company and her daughter's welfare to Josh's care.


Josh possessed the soul of a scholar, finding deep contentment in poetry, but business management remained as foreign to him as a distant planet.


Though Marie lacked experience initially, she burned with ambition and determination, quickly seizing control of Haynes Group with iron-fisted efficiency.


During those early years, she had thrown herself into the work with religious devotion, genuinely abandoning her gambling habits, but temptation had crept back gradually until addiction reclaimed her completely.


Just last month, during what was supposed to be a business trip to Ceswienia, she had succumbed to the glittering allure of a high-end casino, losing tens of millions in a single devastating night and secretly draining company funds to cover the catastrophic losses.


How could they possibly afford a new house when financial ruin lurked around every corner?


Josh studied his wife's increasingly stormy expression and lowered his voice to barely above a whisper. "But if Gabriela's boyfriend discovers we're occupying what rightfully belongs to her, his displeasure could create serious complications for us."



Marie seemed genuinely intimidated by Wesley's influence, so invoking his name should provide the necessary leverage, shouldn't it?



Marie instantly felt an oppressive weight settling over her chest like lead.


The world had shifted beneath their feet, and while she might successfully deceive her naive husband indefinitely, Wesley possessed the sharp intelligence  of a predator who saw through deception with ease.


If Gabriela decided to voiced complaints to her powerful boyfriend, they might find themselves stripped of not only their luxurious home but the company that sustained their entire existence.


Faced with this reality, Marie surrendered to the inevitable. "You have a point. Gabriela has matured into adulthood, and the house must be restored to her rightful ownership..."


Phyllis pressed herself against the study door,eavesdropping on every damning word, and felt ice crystallize in her veins.


She retreated to her bedroom like a ghost haunting familiar corridors.



After her wedding ceremony, she had discovered that adapting to Dustin's cramped and deteriorating apartment proved impossible, so she continued to stay in her own home.



This particular room had once served as Gabriela's sanctuary-the most magnificent and spacious chamber in the entire villa-but Phyllis had claimed it as her own territory through sheer audacity.


She had inhabited these walls for sixteen years.There was no way she would surrender her domain to Gabriela now.



Dustin occupied the bed's edge, absorbed in reviewing a stack of corporate documents with laser-focused intensity.



He possessed genuine dedication and burning ambition, yet remained a mere manager at Haynes Group.



Why had the man she had battled so fiercely to capture turned out to be such a disappointment?



Meanwhile,Gabriela had somehow ensnared Wesley,a man wealthy enough to purchase the entire Haynes Group as casually as ordering coffee.


Shouldn't Gabriela be wallowing in some shady bar,degraded by revolting old predators who traded money for sex?


Resentment burned through Phyllis like acid.


Dustin sensed the weight of her burning stare and looked up to discover her eyes blazing with something that resembled barely contained madness.


"Phyllis, what's troubling you?"


Phyllis jolted back to the present moment as though awakening from a nightmare.


Dustin abandoned his paperwork, crossed the room with purposeful strides, and pressed his lips against hers with tender affection. "Phyllis, do you want to..."


Phyllis recognized the hunger in Dustin's voice and touch, but irritation suddenly flooded her system like poison. She pushed him away with sharp movements. "I'm feeling unwell today."


The sun still blazed outside their windows, and this man couldn't conceive of more productive pursuits to occupy his time?!  Phyllis escaped to the bathroom's privacy and dialed Vivian's number with trembling fingers.


She launched into her interrogation without preamble. "Vivian, you swore you witnessed Gabriela's boyfriend was Brenden with your own eyes. How has Wesley suddenly materialized as her romantic partner? Do you comprehend the catastrophic position you've placed me in?"


Vivian's jaw tightened, the same frustration coiling in her chest.



The wedding disaster had reached her brother's attention like wildfire, resulting in days of brutal lectures that had nearly shattered her sanity, and her monthly allowance had been slashed as punishment.


She fired back with venom, "You also claimed with absolute certainty that Gabriela's boyfriend was some disgusting older man, didn't you?"


Phyllis's exasperaton erupted like a volcano. "This catastrophic blunder has created an enemy out of Mr.Moss himself. Gabriela might exploit this golden opportunity to snatch my family's home."


Vivian's curiosity sharpened to a razor's edge."Explain the situation to me in detail."


Phyllis recounted the conversation she had overheard between her parents, carefully editing the narrative to cast herself in the most sympathetic light possible.


Vivian detected something peculiar in the story."If the house belongs to your family legitimately, why would you fear her?"


"The property originally belonged to Gabriela's late mother," Phyllis confessed reluctantly. "But my mother possesses substantial wealth, so she undoubtedly secured legal ownership years ago through proper channels. After sixteen years of my parents' care, she graduates and immediately attempts to seize the house, leveraging Mr. Moss's intimidating influence. Ultimately, it's my father's bleeding heart causing this mess-he feels guilty about failing to assist Gabriela's mother in her final days and now seeks to compensate Gabriela for his perceived failures."


After absorbing Phyllis's bitter complaints, Vivian's mind sparked with malicious inspiration. "Phyllis, I maintain connections with an influencer who commands thirty million devoted followers. Let's orchestrate something spectacular that will obliterate Gabriela's reputation completely. Are you prepared to join this war?"


Recognizing Vivian's proven capabilities, Phyllis felt excitement surge through her bloodstream like electricity.


Without hesitation, she declared her allegiance."Why would I refuse such a perfect opportunity?"
###Chapter 75 A Smear Campaign





Gabriela remained blissfully unaware that Phyllis was once again scheming against her.


While staying at Wesley's place, she felt nothing but radiant, unshakable happiness.


With the kind of money she was making on the side,she had no trouble staying cheerful al year.


Even better, Miriam and Loretta had finally stopped insisting she share a room with Wesley, arranging a bright, spacious guest room just for her.


After a hot shower, she flopped onto the plush mattress, rolling across it like a carefree child,soaking in the luxury.


The past two nights in Wesley's bed had left her taut with unease, unable to truly savor the mansion's soft linens. Now, with the space all to herself, she felt her whole body loosen in quiet relief. Eventually, she tired from her rolling spree,grabbed her phone, and started scrolling-only to have it buzz in her hand with an incoming call from Aubrey.


"Aubrey? Is that really you? I assumed you'd be too preoccupied with your boyfriend. I'm surprised you'd even think to call me..."


Gabriela had been ready to tease Aubrey about clinging to her boyfriend, but the sharp edge in Aubrey's voice cut her short.


"You've got enough trouble as it is, and you're cracking jokes? Get on Instagram and Twitter right now-someone's dragging your name through the mud!"



It turned out a high-profile Instagram influencer who went by Gem and commanded a massive following of thirty million had posted a scathing video.


In it, Gem claimed Gabriela had been orphaned at eight, taken in by her uncle, and given every opportunity-financial support, a good home, even a g raduate education. Now, Gabriela was repaying that kindness by trying to snatch her uncle's house out from under him. Under her relentless pressure, her uncle began considering gifting her the property outright.


But if she succeeded in taking it, the video asked,what was stopping her from coming for the family business next?



The post was gaining momentum fast on Instagram-enough to stir trouble, though not yet enough to blow up into an overnight sensation.


Claire's repost was what turned a flicker into a full-blown blaze. She added her own remark beneath it,"A small favor earns gratitude, but an overly generous one often breeds resentment. In a world where good people are the ones who get hurt, this kind of behavior is chilling. Cut those ungrateful leeches out of your life."


Claire, the undisputed queen of entertainment, had many followers. Her devoted fans quickly echoed her stance. 
Within hours, Gabriela's name had been shoved into the number-four spot on the trending chart.


The post drew wave after wave of condemnation.


"People like her ruin it for everyone-the good ones give up, and the real needy get left with nothing."


"It's parasites like Gabriela that have sucked every last shred of kindness out of this world."


The outrage swelled, and the mob's determination to track her down and publicly shame her grew fiercer by the minute.


Within thirty minutes, someone dug up an old video from her high school days, showing her laughing with a pack of notorious delinquents at a bar.


Soon after, her workplace was outed, and some people claimed that they would confront her there once the holiday break ended.


Some queried in disbelief, "Isn't Apex Group the developer behind the country's most popular game?How the hell could they hire someone as pathetic as her?"


Gabriela's pulse quickened as she scrolled. Before she could decide whether to keep reading, her phone lit up-Aubrey again. "I just heard Phyllis is planning to go on Gem's livestream tomorrow to squeeze sympathy out of the audience," Aubrey warned, her voice brimming with indignation.


Though she didn't know the full story of Gabriela's family, she trusted her enough to believe she'd never scheme to steal her uncle's home.


In Aubrey's mind, the real villain could only be that sly manipulator-Phyllis.


"I've got a friend with over three million followers-should I ask her to step in and set the record straight?" Aubrey swiftly pressed on.


While her friend simmered with outrage, Gabriela stayed composed, a quiet instinct telling her this could be her best moment to tip the scales in her favor. She comforted Aubrey, "Don't work yourself up over it. Let's just get some rest and see where things stand in the morning."


"Why wait until morning?" Aubrey's temper was teetering on the edge of explosion. "Do you have any idea just how much sway Claire holds? You're already sitting at number four on the tending list-by tomorrow you'll probably be number one! How can Claire be so blind? Those lies are transparent as glass! I'm disgusted I ever admired her."


Though she was once a devoted fan of Claire,Aubrey chose to put her faith in Gabriela rather than a stranger's smear.


Gabriela's lips curved faintly as she assured, "Relax.I've got a plan."


She reasoned that Claire hadn't bought the influencer's story. This was likely payback for that banquet incident with the styling team-a grudge Claire clearly hadn't let go of.


Gabriela's unshaken demeanor gradually eased Aubrey's temper. "For real?" she asked, still worried about her.


"I mean it. Trust me," Gabriela replied, her tone calm and laced with quiet conviction.


After years of swallowing her pride, she felt as though fate was finally sliding a weapon into her hand.


Tonight, she needed Phyllis to fan the flames until the drama boiled over.



A flicker of anticipation warmed her chest as she imagined Phyllis pushing things further, the scandal would spread like wildfire.


If all went perfectly, the entire internet would know by morning.


With that thought, Gabriela set her phone aside and settled in, ready for a full night's rest.


Tomorrow, the counterattack would begin.


Even under the weight of malicious stories, she drifted into a deep, untroubled sleep.


Claire, meanwhile, faced her manager's sharp rebuke for reposting on Twitter. "Claire, you've worked so hard to reach this point. One careless post from you can set the internet ablaze. Mind your words and actions before they blow up in your face!"


Claire leaned back, utterly unfazed.


She had already dug into Gabriela's past and knew her high school reputation was far from spotless.This was her chance to let Wesley see the real Gabriela.



The influencer's damning video was a gift-why wouldn't she make the most of it?


The manager pressed on with gentle words of caution. "Stay out of these messy disputes. They can drag you down before you realize it."


She waved him off with an impatient flick of her hand. "Gabriela's nothing but a pest. I could crush her whenever I feel like it. And if you keep nagging, I'll skip the SK Elite Boutique endorsement altogether."


The manager decided it was wiser to say nothing more.


The endorsement-once well beyond Claire's grasp-had been won through backdoor ties to the CEO of the Vasquez Group.


The uproar online grew so deafening that even Marie caught wind of it.


One after another, ladies from high society called,their voices dripping with sympathy and polite concern.


Keeping her tone as serene as still water, Marie offered the same line to each of them. "Gabriela's a good person deep down, just a little too stubborn for her own good."


They gushed over her supposed graciousness,but behind the mask, Marie's lips curled in a sharp,disdainful smile. There was nothing gracious about her intentions.


Now that the matter had spiraled, she was content to sit back and watch.


If Gabriela's reputation crumbled under this storm,she would sleep easy knowing the house and company would remain securely in her hands.


That night, many tossed and turned in restless sleep.


But Gabriela-the very target of those spiteful whispers-slumbered without a care and woke up feeling rested and clear-headed.


Soon after, Aubrey called Gabriela again. Her voice burst through the phone, bright with surprise."Gabriela, every trending topic about you is gone!"


She didn't even pause before adding, "No wonder you weren't panicking last night. Someone powerful must've stepped in! I'm telling you, it has to be our handsome, mighty boss backing you up!"


Gabriela hadn't said a word before Aubrey barreled ahead with her string of guesses. As Aubrey's rapid-fire chatter finally tapered off, a thought began to settle in Gabriela's mind.


Who else could wipe every trace of those trending topics in a single night? It could only be Wesley's doing.


Once the call ended, she descended the stairs in search of him-only to spot Billy making his way toward the study.


She lingered a moment, then followed at a measured pace.
###Chapter 76 Taking Action





Billy burst intoWesley's study without hesitation.


Wesley, seated at his sleek black desk, was already two-thirds deep into a book.


At the sound of the door, he closed it with a precise snap and set it aside, attention now fully on his assistant.



Billy wasted no time, launching into a detailed report."Mr. Moss, all traces of the incident online are gone.When Miss Haynes wakes, she won't suspect a thing.Claire's luxury deals are canceled. SK Elite Boutique has sworn never to work with her again, and she's been axed from the most popular drama this year.She won't recover from this anytime soon."


Wesley lifted his gaze, nodded once, and said, "Well done. Keep an eye on things over the next few days."


Billy straightened, shoulders back, pride practically radiating off him. "Mr.Moss, you don't have to worry.Miss Haynes won't face a single problem while I'm on watch."



To Billy, this was nothing more than doing what was expected of him.


Lately, cruising around in Wesley's sleek black Porsche had earned him envious stares at every turn.Even Erik from the Williams Group had come by,gawking at the car and muttering under his breath about how stingy his own boss was.


Billy couldn't hide the smug grin creeping onto his face.



Yet, beneath his pride, he felt a sliver of guilt toward Gabriela. The car that Wesley had given him wasn't a gift; it was payment for keeping the truth from her.


And thinking of Gabriela in trouble made him resolve,silently but firmly, to go all out for her,whether Wesley asked or not.


As their discussion wound through business matters, Wesley's eyes flicked toward the door,a faint,almost imperceptible smile tugging at his lips.


"Ms.Haynes,please come in."


Gabriela had been standing in the doorway,eavesdropping on their conversation. In that moment, she realized that Wesley truly was looking out for her. He had even instructed Billy to personally oversee the situation.


From childhood until now, no one had ever stood by her so unwaveringly, silently shielding her from everything that could hurt her.


If Wesley were interested in women, Gabriela knew without a doubt that she would want to marry him.


She felt a surge of warmth, and then, startled by his voice, she slowly stepped into the study.


Wesley leaned back in his chair, a faint, unreadable smile tugging at the corner of his lips as his fingers tapped a quiet rhythm on the desk. "So, how much did you catch?" "Maybe... a third," Gabriela replied, her voice steady."Mr. Moss, I didn't mean to eavesdrop."


The study was soundproofed well enough that she'd only picked up fragments.


Wesley's gaze lingered on her thoughtfully,suddenly realizing that she was already aware of the online storm swirling around her.


"Are you scared?" he asked, voice calm but probing.


"Not at all," Gabriela said instantly, her eyes meeting his. "With you backing me, Mr. Moss, what could there possibly be to fear?"


Wesley's smile widened imperceptibly. HHer rare confidence, so bold, so unapologetic, was unexpectedly charming.


She pressed her advantage, determination threading through her tone. "I'd like to take half a day off today."


After waiting so long, she finally had her opening.
With Wesley in her corner, she could act decisively and hit Phyllis where it would hurt most.


Later, she would meet two very important people-individuals who held the keys to her vengeance against Phyllis.


"Approved." Wesley didn't ask any more questions."Where are you headed? Let my driver take you."


Gabriela inclined her head politely. "Thank you, Mr.Moss."



Billy couldn't resist chiming in. "I drove here.I can give you a ride, Miss Haynes."


Gabriela blinked, a little caught off guard by Billy's unexpected kindness. He was such a nice soul.


Billy, for his part, was equally surprised.


While everyone else was already on vacation,Gabriela still had to request a leave of absence from Wesley to leave his house.


Could it be that Wesley already considered her his private property? He'd always seemed refined and restrained, yet who would have guessed he could be so possessive and so quietly intense.


Billy's sympathy for Gabriela deepened.


Wesley simply nodded. "Alright."


He already had a sense of her plan. And with Billy's combat expertise, she'd be safe under his watch.


Billy and Gabriela stepped out of the study together.


Gabriela exchanged a few quick words with Miriam and Loretta before slipping into Billy's sleek black Porsche and leaving the manor.


As the scenery blurred past the window, a surge of emotions swelled within her.



Sixteen years had passed.


Could she really reclaim what her mother had left behind this time?



If she failed, who knew how many more years she'd have to wait. Noticing her downcast gaze, Billy offered a gentle reassurance. "Don't let it get to you. People online don't know the truth, so they hurl those cruel words at you.Mr. Moss has already wiped all related topics.Soon,no one will even remember."


"Thank you, Mr. Clarke," Gabriela replied with a small smile. "I'm not upset... actualy, I'm quite happy."


Her plan had always been long-term: spend years building workplace connections, saving money,and gradually turning the tables on Marie.


She had never imagined Phyllis would hand her such a golden opportunity.


With Wesley supporting her, she felt she already had the strongest ally she could ask for.



...


Following Gabriela's directions, Billy drove nearly halfway across Okburg. Two hours later, they arrived at their destination.


"Miss Haynes, is this the place? Would you like me to accompany you inside?" Billy offered.


"No, thank you, Mr. Clarke. I can manage on my own."


They had reached one of Okburg's old districts.The alley ahead was too narrow for a car, so Gabriela stepped out and continued on foot.


She stopped before a weathered wooden door and knocked.


Moments later, it creaked open, revealing an older man.


He wasn't yet sixty, but gray streaked through his temples, and his eyes carried the weight of years.


Gabriela's eyes glimmered with unshed tears. Softly,she whispered, "Farley."


"Miss Haynes?" Farley Moreno's face lit up in recognition.


He had once served as right-hand man to Alanna Haynes, Gabriela's late mother. Though she'd insisted countless times that he use her first name, he never wavered. He addressed her formally as "Miss Haynes," a mark of both respect and enduring loyalty.


"Please, come in and have a seat, Miss Haynes."


The last time Farley had seen her was before her college entrance exams. Her arm had been scalded by Phyllis with boiling water, and she'd battled a high fever for days.


Gabriela had asked Farley to take photos as evidence of the incident.



Afterward, she had secretly left half of her hard-earned savings with him, promising to return only when the time came to reclaim her mother's belongings.


Six years had passed in the blink of an eye.


Gabriela sat down and briefly outlined her plan.


Farley's eyes lit up. "Miss Haynes, you're finally taking action?" Gabriela nodded solemnly, a trace of concern in her voice. "Farley, I'm sorry, but after this, there's no going back. Life's going to get more complicated from here onwards."


"It's fine," he said firmly, unwavering. "I've waited for this day every single day. As long as I can help you make things right, I'll do whatever it takes!"


Gabriela chuckled softly. "For now, I just need you to bring out my mother's will. I will let everyone see it."


"Right away, Miss Haynes!"


With that, Farley rose immediately and went to unlock the safe.


Gabriela spent the next hour at Farley's side,carefully sorting through documents.


As she prepared to leave, she paused-her eyes tracing the dilapidated house, then dropping to Farley's crippled foot. Her voice softened. "Farley,once the house is mine, would you like to move in and live with me?" Farley shook his head firmly, a small,knowing smile tugging at his lips. "I've lived here for years. This place is my home now. I don't want to go anywhere else. But you have my word, I'll always be here,and if you ever need me, I'll be ready,no questions asked."


Gabriela nodded, understanding.


Some things couldn't be rushed. She would revisit the idea once the house was truly hers.


After bidding farewell to Farley, she went back to Billy. "Sorry to keep you waiting."


"It's nothing," he replied quickly. "Where to next,Miss Haynes?"


Gabriela's lips curved into a wistful smile,eyes glimmering with a touch of nostalgia. "To a bar called Midnight Oasis."
 ###Chapter 77 Pining For Her Cooking




Only a few days remained before the New Year, and the streets were silent, almost abandoned.


Billy kept the car moving briskly, reaching the Midnight Oasis bar in just under thirty minutes.


Its exterior leaned toward a gothic mood-murals of shadow-thick forests, inky vines, and watchful ravens stretched across the walls. By contrast,a patch of emerald-green plants formed a neat little garden near the entrance, a touch of life breaking the darkness.



The mix of styles gave the place an odd yet memorable charm.


Midday left the bar nearly empty, its quiet settling like a soft echo in the air.


Gabriela cast Billy a knowing glance. "That's quite a drive, Mr. Clarke. Just give me a little time, and I'll take you out for lunch," she promised lightly.


Billy opened his mouth to decline, but Gabriela had already slipped out of the car.


She had arranged everything beforehand with the bar's owner, and before she even crossed the threshold, a tall, broad-shouldered man strode out,his deep voice carrying easily. "Gabriela! Finally,you're here!"


Flashing him a warm, easy smile, she replied, "Hey,Tyler.Been a long time."


Tyler Jordan owned the place.


Years back, when Marie's gambling habit had spiraled out of control, she'd racked up overthree hundred thousand in debt. Tyler's father had been among the creditors-holding an IOU from Marie for twenty thousand.


With Gabriela's mother's help, Marie could have wiped out all her debts.


Just a day before she secured the funds, Tyler's father went to collect money from another debtor.The man, crushed under the pressure, jumped into the river, and the incident spiraled into tragedy.


The man's death brought the police down on Tyler's father, who was sentenced to twenty years in prison -and he had yet to see freedom.


Unlike his father, Tyler refused to walk the same ruinous path. He worked hard, saved every penny,and eventually opened his own bar, determined to live clean. Back in Gabriela's high school days,she had worked as a bartender at Tyler's bar.


Her striking looks and natural charm drew customers in without her even trying, turning the bar into a livelier spot whenever she was around.


Tyler had always been the dependable sort-steadfast, straightforward, and protective. To him,Gabriela was just a poor girl trying to save up for tuition, and he quietly took it upon himself to look out for her.


Over time, their easy conversations turned into Back when he first learned about her suffering, Tyler had reacted the same way-threatening to rally his friends to grind Phyllis's bones and win back Gabriela's house.


Years had passed, but his hot-headed streak was as fierce as ever.


Gabriela chuckled, shaking her head, "No need for an army this time, Tyler. Just help me record a quick video."


"Name it and it's done," he said without hesitation."What do you want me to say?"


Pulling out her phone, Gabriela adjusted the camera and hit record.


Once the matter was wrapped up, Tyler insisted she stay for lunch.


"I've got a friend waiting outside," Gabriela said with a quick smile. "I'll bring him in to join us."


She jogged out to the curb, waved Billy over, and ushered him inside before introducing him to Tyler. Tyler clasped Billy's hand in a firm shake. "So, you're Gabriela's boss, huh? Quite the high achiever." His grin widened as he added, "Gabriela is at a top university, and she'll graduate with a master's degree next year. She's every bit as impressive. You make sure you take good care of her."


Billy kept his reaction to himself, though inside he marveled that Gabriela had such a capable friend.


A thought crossed his mind-was Wesley meant to hear about this,given his possessive streak?


Before long, Tyler had filled the table with steaming,fragrant dishes and threw down a challenge for Billy to drink against him.


Gabriela leaned in, her voice light but resolute. "Not happening. He's the one behind the wheel later."


Respecting the reminder, Tyler simply chuckled and poured himself a few cups instead.


When the last plate was cleared, Billy found Tyler surprisingly likable,the kind of man he could trust. Tyler, feeling the same, treated Billy as though they'd already shared years of friendship. "Swing by whenever you've got time, man. I know a guy like you might think we're a bit rough around the edges,butl stick by my friends. I've got plenty of friends I can call on, and if you ever run into trouble, I'll back you up without a second thought. Gabriela's had a hard road-do me a favor and keep an eye out for her.I owe you one."


As they stepped out of the bar, Billy remarked with a hint of amusement, "Your friend's got quite the passionate streak, Miss Haynes."


Gabriela's smile warmed. "Tyler really is a wonderful person."


Billy gave a slight jolt, as if her words had caught him off guard. Wesley could never know about this.


On their way back to the Moss Manor, the place was already buzzing with activity.


With Gabriela absent, lunch duties fell to Loretta and Miriam, who laid out braised ribs, steamed fish,stir- fried beef, and a few simple side dishes.


They avoided onions and celery, which Wesley couldn't stand, and left out any trace of chili.


Yet for all its effort, the spread lacked the warmth of Gabriela's cooking.



Loretta had been feeding Wesley for more than ten years, but today every bite tasted flat, as if the flavor had been drained away.


He toyed with hisfork but barely ate a bite.


Brenden leaned over with a mischievous grin."How come Gabriela's not in the kitchen today? I've been dreaming about those BBQ ribs she makes."


A cold shadow crossed Wesley's face.


Loretta cut Brenden a sharp look before setting down a plate of fish. "What, you think she works here just to feed you? Eat your fish."


Gabriela's hefty daily rate was meant to coax Wesley into opening his heart-not to give Brenden someone boss around in the dining room.


Brenden sat frozen in disbelief.


No mouthwatering dishes from Gabriela today-and now this dreadful, overcooked fish? The day was ruined.



Meanwhile, Gabriela had no idea Wesley was quietly pining for her cooking.



She was absorbed in messaging Aubrey.


Although Wesley had already wiped every trace of the scandal from trending topics, the netizens hadn't forgotten.


Comments still seethed with anger, accusing Gabriela of throwing her weight around and lashing back because she had something to hide.


Though the trending topics about her had disappeared, public anger still simmered.


Relentless critics drifted to other popular platforms,publishing long tirades that dragged Gabriela into even larger conversations.


Before long, the scandal reached people who neither followed celebrity gossip nor touched Instagram.


Some influential figures insisted Gabriela had no moral compass and was nothing but an ingrate.



Their words ignited another wave of outrage,with uninformed netizens piling on and hurling ugly insults her way.


By the end of the day, Gabriela's name was dirt,her reputation beyond repair.


Aubrey fumed behind her phone, locked in an endless online brawl, trading blow after blow with strangers in Gabriela's defense.


She sent Gabriela a furious message. "Have Mr.Moss handle these fools and get their accounts wiped out."


In her eyes, these nobodies had no right to hurl such vile insults at Gabriela. Gabriela offered an assurance. "I've alreadythought of a way to handle it. Just breathe, Aubrey. Don't lower yourself to their level."


But Aubrey's temper refused to cool.


The attacks online were far too vicious, and if the truth wasn't cleared up soon, once work started again, their colleagues would inevitably look at Gabriela with contempt.
###Chapter 78 Gabriela Was Branded As Trash
Aubrey was seething with anger, unleashing a torrent of curses at Phyllis and her whole family.


As Phyllis' cousin, Gabriela felt unfairly pulled into the conflict.


To calm Aubrey's escalating fury, Gabriela shared the two videos she had recorded earlier that day.


Soon after,Aubrey fell silent.


Later, after watching the videos, she called Gabriela,her tone brimming with enthusiasm. "Gabriela, you're incredible! How did you get these videos? Why didn't you tell me sooner? I was so stressed out!"


Gabriela offered a weary smile. "I've always said there's no need to panic or lose your temper."


"I thought you were just trying to make me feel better," Aubrey admitted. Then she proposed,"Should I get my friend with three million followers to share the video now?"



Gabriela responded calmly, "No need to rush. Let's hold off for now."



"Alright, I'll follow your lead this time!" Aubrey agreed.


After diffusing Aubrey's anger, Gabriela leaned against her seat, feeling exhausted.


Meanwhile, Billy, who was driving, stole subtle glances at her.



All morning, Gabriela had seemed unlike her usual vibrant, cheerful self. Today she was unusually quiet,yet there was a newfound calmness about her.



It was as if the confident, carefree persona she usually projected was a carefully constructed mask.Beneath it, she seemed to be patiently biding her time, waiting for an opportunity to escape the chaos surrounding her. Billy was struck by this realization.


Gabriela was such a kind,genuine person, yet she was forced to endure such distressing circumstances. It felt profoundly unfair.


He silently hoped that Wesley would always be kind to her.



Eager to return to the Moss Manor and update Wesley on the situation, he was interrupted by a call from Wesley while still on the road.


It turned out Phyllis had gone live online.


She and Vivian had been stirring up trouble all night.When a well-known celebrity like Claire shared their video, the drama quickly made it onto the trending lists.



Phyllis was thrilled, reveling in the attention and unable to sleep from the excitement. But by morning,all the trending topics related to Gabriela had vanished.


Marie warned Phyllis, "You failed to take Gabriela down completely, so stop now. I'll clean up this mess."


Phyllis,however, refused to back down.


Even after the trending topics were removed, the post continued to gain traction across various platforms.


Unwilling to let go of her vendetta, Phyllis secretly met with Vivian and that influencer, Gem, to plan a live stream.



At 2 p.m., Gem appeared on the live stream,her face heavily made-up and enhanced by beauty filters,giving her an almost artificial, doll-like appearance.


As the stream began, her followers flooded the chat with greetings and crude questions about Gabriela's situation.


Gem introduced Phyllis, who looked strikingly beautiful with subtle makeup, further refined by the stream's filters.


The audience buzzed with curiosity about her identity.


Phyllis introduced herself and launched into a carefully rehearsed speech.


She claimed Gabriela, whom her family had raised,was vain, ill-tempered, and rebellious, constantly borrowing her clothes and jewelry without permission.


As Gabriela grew older, she used her looks to hang out with unsavory characters at bars. After starting her career, she set her sights on taking her uuncle's house.



Worse, Phyllis accused Gabriela of trying to seduce her newlywed husband, who had been Gabriela's schoolmate and someone she admired.


Phyllis delivered her accusations with a soft, weary tone, appearing polite and fragile, which quickly won over the sympathy of viewers.


The comment section exploded with support for her and bitter criticism against Gabriela. "Stay strong, Phyllis! Millions of us have your back!"


"Gabriela is so disgusting. What a despicable person!"


"When you encounter someone this awful, you cut them out of your life so they can't hurt you."


"Phyllis's parents even helped Gabriela get through college, and this is how she is repaid? Unbelievable!"


The screen was soonflooded with hateful remarks directed at Gabriela.



"Gabriela should go to hell!"


"Bitch!"



"Utterly repulsive."


"Shameless."


Wesley, who had tasked Billy with monitoring the situation, was also keeping a close eye on the online developments.


Seeing the overwhelming wave of malice and insults aimed at Gabriela, Wesley's expression darkened. He immediately ordered Billy to contact a top PR expert,sparing no expense to reverse the tide of public opinion as quickly as possible.


Billy, still driving, pulled over to the side of the road and explained, "I'm about half an hour from the estate."



Wesley's impatience was palpable.


He trusted Billy above all his other capable assistants and wouldn't feel confident entrusting this task to anyone else.



Overhearing the conversation, Gabriela spoke up softly."Let me talk to Mr. Moss."



She took Billy's phone and, in a calm tone,reassured Wesley, "I'm fine, Mr. Moss. You don't need to worry about this. I can handle it myself."


This was a personal matter between her and Phyllis,and Gabriela was determined to resolve it on her own terms. Wesley's brow remained furrowed. "Are you sure you're okay?"


Most women would be devastated by such an onslaught, and Gabriela's composure took him by surprise.



Her insistence on handling it herself left him feeling sidelined and displeased.



"I'm fine," Gabriela assured him. "But I do have one small favor to ask."



Wesley's mood lifted slightly. "What is it?"


"I was hoping you could advance my salary," she said.



While the current online buzz was significant,Gabriela worried that Aubrey's friend with three million followers might not generate enough attention, and she might need to hire paid promoters to amplify her response.



Wesley's face soured instantly. Why was she begging for money while her reputation was in tatters?



He scoffed,"Fine.How much do you need?"


He half-jokingly thought he might as well advance her salary for years to come, tying her to Apex Group indefinitely.


Gabriela named the amount she needed, and after their discussion, she handed the phone back to Billy and checked her own.



An unknown number was calling.


She answered, only to be met with a middle-aged man's voice, dripping with malice. "You're Gabriela,right? Listen, you're an absolute disgrace. Your workplace address is out there now-brace yourself for what is coming. Go to hell,you worthless trash."


The words were venomous, laced with vile intent,as if the caller wanted to destroy her through the phone.


Gabriela calmly ended the call and switched her phone to silent. Her number had been leaked online, and a flood of harassing calls and messages filled with hateful,repulsive language followed.


Despite her mental preparation, the intensity of it all still caught her off guard.


She texted Aubrey, "Time to post those two videos.Please thank your friend for helping out. I owe her a meal."



Aubrey, eager to expose Phyllis's true colors, replied with enthusiasm, "No problem. Let's take Phyllis down!"







After ending the live stream, Phyllis noticed dozens of missed calls from Marie.


She called back casually. "Mom..."


Before she could continue, Marie cut her off sharply."Go back online now and clarify that everything you said was a misunderstanding. Gabriela didn't steal our house-it was hers to begin with." Phyllis's face darkened."No."


When she had earlier unveiled her so-called truth,the online crowd rallied behind her, unleashing a barrage of insults at Gabriela far more venomous and degrading than she had anticipated.


Gabriela was branded as trash, a nuisance, while she was elevated as the epitome of innocence and virtue.


Having invested so much effort in fueling this controversy, why would she now step in to defend Gabriela?



"Mom, you're the one who always said-if you want something, you seize it, no matter what it takes,"Phyllis declared. "Now that Gabriela is a public target, open to everyone's attacks, why should I show her any mercy?"
###Chapter 79 Turning The Tables




"Idiot!" Marie's voice cracked like a whip, her chest tight with fury and dread.


She should've shut Phyllis down the moment she caught wind of those trending topics last night.


Unfortunately, greed and overblown confidence had blinded her.



She'd convinced herself Wesley barely cared about Gabriela or maybe found her such a headache that he'd toss her aside without a second thought.


But who could have guessed the entire scandal would vanish from the internet by morning? Deleted.Erased. As if it had never existed.


And who else could pull strings like that except Wesley himself?


The message couldn't have been clearer: Gabriela was under his protection. Handing the house back quietly might've kept the peace.


But, no! Phyllis had to go live, grinning into the camera as if she were the victim. She was digging her own grave.


Marie snapped, pacing like a caged tiger, "Wesley had the trending topics killed overnight. He's protecting Gabriela, and you still dare to livestream?What are you thinking? That you're important enough for him to crush personally?"


Phyllis crossed her arms, chin tiIted in defiance."No matter how rich or powerful he is, he can't muzzle the entire internet."


She thought back to the flood of sympathy in her live chat as millions rallied behind her, spitting venom at Gabriela's name.


The memory curled her lips into a smug smile.


Trending topics? Sure, he could erase those. But public opinion? That was a beast even Wesley couldn't cage.


"You idiot! Get back on that livestream and apologize to Gabriela! Right now!" Marie's temper was a storm breaking loose. She couldn't comprehend how a woman as shrewd and capable as herself had ended up with a daughter so dangerously clueless.


"If you don't do as I say," she shouted, her voice cutting through the air, "then pack your things tonight and get the hell out of here! Go live in that pathetic shoebox your poor husband calls home!"


Phyllis, spoiled from birth and unaccustomed to such brutal words, slammed her phone down.


From across the room, Vivian's amused laugh floated over. "Let me guess, your mother's asking you to let Gabriela off the hook?"



Phyllis scowled, arms crossed, though a flicker of unease passed through her eyes. "She's scared Wesley will take Gabriela's side."


Vivian waved off the concern with a lazy smirk. "Please. You know exactly what kind of man Wesley is. If he really gave a damn, he'd have done more than just scrub the trending topics last night."


By the window, Gem lounged with feline grace,admiring her freshly painted nails. She didn't even look up as she chimed in, her tone silky and dismissive. "Wesley lives in a world none of us will ever touch. Gabriela's just a pretty distraction to him,nothing more. Wiping those trending topics? That was a casual flick of his wrist. You really think he's in love with her?"


In just six months, Gem had climbed from a few hundred followers to thirty million, riding a wvave of influence powered by a benefactor whose reach was every bit as dangerous as it was powerful.


"And look at Claire! She's the one who actually lit the match for those trending topics," Gem said, still admiring the glossy curve of her nails. "If Wesley were truly out for blood over some woman, Claire would've been exiled from the entertainment industry before sunrise." Phyllis felt some of the tightness in her chest ease at Gem's calm, cutting logic.


Exactly. Why would a man like Wesley waste his energy protecting Gabriela for long?


And Phyllis had already planted the seed that Gabriela was still hung up on Dustin. If Wesley had even an ounce of pride as a man, the idea would fester.


Surely by now, Gabriela was halfway out the door of the Moss Manor, if not already thrown to the curb.


The more she thought about it, the more certain Phyllis became.



The internet was in a frenzy today, a perfect storm of scandal. Gabriela's name had shot to the top ofthe trending list like a flare in the night.


Those in the know spat her name like a curse. While curious strangers, lured in by the sudden buzz,looked her up, only to join the chorus of mockery and contempt. Then came the twist. A minor influencer, known online as Little Bell, dropped a video.


It was Farley's account of what had really happened.


In the video, he didn't waste a second on pleasantries. His voice was steady, but there was a hard edge beneath it.


"My name is Farley Moreno. I once served as the assistant to Ms. Alanna Haynes, the former CEO of the Haynes Group. She wasn't just a remarkable leader, she was a devoted mother who cherished Gabriela like the most precious thing in her life.When Gabriela was only eight, tragedy struck. Ms. Haynes was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Knowing her time was short, she entrusted her younger brother,Josh, with Gabriela's care. She even paid off more than thirty thousand in gambling debts for his wife,Marie-hoping that kindness would buy Gabriela a lifetime of peace."



Pausing for a moment, Farley's jaw tightened."After Ms. Haynes passed, Marie took over the Haynes Group and used her position to frame me for embezzlement. I had no way to fight back and I was forced to resign. It didn't end there. She sent men to break my right leg and warned me to stay far away from her affairs. She thought that by cutting down everyone who'd been close to Ms. Haynes, she could finally sleep easy. What she never knew, was that l kept a copy of Ms. Haynes's will."


His hands shook as he held the document up to the camera.


The words were clear, stark, undeniable. "Haynes Group is to be temporarily managed by Josh Haynes.Once Gabriela Haynes reaches the age of twenty-two, the company must be returned to her,unconditionally."


The title of the video flashed across the screen:Gabriela's Late Mother's Will.

It was Gabriela's own choice. A deliberate spark to ignite the flames. She'd be a fool not to ride this wave, especially when it was her story to tell.

And it worked. The moment the video went live,the internet lit up. Shocked viewers flooded the comments, sharing and reposting until the story began to spread like wildfire.


Meanwhile, Wesley had eyes everywhere. The moment the video crossed his desk, he didn't hesitate. One call, and the clip was flooded with paid traffic, catapulting it straight to the top of the trending list.


Within hours, the video wasn't just viral; it was the most talked about thing online.


Little Bell's follower count exploded by hundreds of thousands, climbing by the minute. Sensing the momentum, she struck again.


The second video opened with a scene that hooked viewers instantly.


Tyler, a debt collector with a gravelly voice and a scowl, addressed the camera, demanding repayment from Marie. "You've been carrying these gambling debts for sixteen years, Marie Haynes. And we're not even asking for interest, just the damn principal. Consider it a favor."


Tyler held up the IOU, then laid bare his father's ruin,using it as a stark warning against the grip of gambling.


The proof was unshakable. Sixteen years ago, Marie hadn't just been a gambler; she had been drowning in debt. And the one who'd thrown her a lifeline,covering every last cent, had been Gabriela's mother,Alanna.


When both videos finished their circuit online, a strange hush fell over the internet. It was the silence before the backlash, that collective pause when millions of people realized the story they'd been shouting about was not true.


An hour ago, Gabriela's name had been spat like poison. People had been calling her every insult in the book. Some had even planned to track her down in person, certain they were on the side of justice.


The videos hit the internet like a slap that echoed,leaving the mob stunned and off-balance.An influencer with fifty million followers cut straight to the bone. "Phyllis and her family were liars.On her live stream, she claimed Gabriela was trying to steal her home. That was a lie. The house they were staying in was Gabriela's to begin with. Yet, Phyllis still dared to play the victim. That's not just shameless; it's rotten."


Then came another blow.


Gabriela's high school teacher stepped forward and made a post. "Gabriela was an extraordinary student.When her aunt refused to pay her tuition and even tried to have her expelled, she worked part-time to cover her own fees. She sat for the college entrance exam with a fever and still earned a place at Okburg's top university, Rutherford University. I wanted to help her more back then, but her aunt was too domineering. All I could do was offer small,discreet aid. I still regret not doing more."


This video spread like wildfire, reshared again and again, each repost twisting the knife in Phyllis's public image.
###Chapter 80 The Netizens Are Lashing Out At Phyllis
The netizens who watched Gabriela'shigh school teacher's video were completely stunned.


Some of them suddenly realized that she had only taken that bar job to scrape together her tuition,rather than mess around with unsavory characters.


But then came the voice of a baffled netizen."Gabriela busted her back working part-time just to stay in school, yet her cousin dragged her name through the mud, calling her shameless and without dignity. Here's what I don't get. Why did she suddenly burn with a raging fever on the very days of the college entrance exams? Something about the whole story feels off, like puzzle pieces that don't quite fit. I just pray the truth isn't as cold and ugly as the thought gnawing at the back of my mind."


Farley had been quietly tracking the online chatter all
  When he saw the latest rumors swirling,he made a snap decision and asked his young neighbor to post the photos of Gabriela's burned arm.


Because the post carried Gabriela's name, it ignited like dry tinder. Shares multiplied, comments poured in, and by morning, the young man's account had surged by over a hundred thousand followers.


He was left blinking at the numbers, utterly floored.


Farley then recorded another video and clarified the story behind those photos. "When Gabriela was a child, Phyllis made a sport of tormenting her by kicking her out of bed in the dead of night, slicing her school uniforms into rags, and letting her starve. At school, Phyllis rallied others to shun her, spreading lies that tarnished her reputation. And Gabriela...she just clenched her jaw and endured it. Before her college entrance exams, Phyllis stormed into her room at midnight with a kettle of boiling water.Gabriela woke in time to shield her face, but her left arm... The skin came away in layers. She burned with fever until the exams were over. If she hadn't woken up, her face would have been ruined forever."


Farley's eyes glistened red as he spoke. The memory alone was enough to tear him apart.


If Alanna had known what her daughter endured,it would have shattered her.



The video revealed the harsh truth with photos of angry red burns on Gabriela's arm, accompanied by Farley's raw account.



Viewers couldn't watch without feeling a knot in their chests. Comments flooded in.


"Honestly, Phyllis is a monster. She and her family are toxic to the core. Alanna paid off Phyllis's mother's debts, gave them a home, even handed them a company. No one asked them to treat Gabriela like royalty, but the bare minimum of treating her like a human being wasn't too much to ask."



"If Alanna had left her daughter with a random family,Gabriela would have had a far better life than this." was wrong to criticize Gabriela. I owe her an apology."


"Count me in."



"Same here."







The moment Gabriela returned to her room at Moss Manor, she locked the door and sat by the window,phone in hand, watching the online tide turn in her favor.



In just hours, she had flipped the board entirely.


Now, it was Phyllis and her family who were in the crosshairs, with public fury beating down on them like relentless waves. Any hope of a quiet New Year had gone up in smoke.


Soon, some netizens gathered outside Rosemont Gardens, shouting for Phyllis and her family to return the house to Gabriela.



The gates stayed sealed, the windows dark. Not a single face dared show itself to the mob outside.


Inside, the air was equally tense. Marie's voice sliced through the living room like a whip. "I told you to stop, but you just had to keep going. Now Wesley doesn't even have to lift a finger. The netizens are lashing out at you."


Phyllis's complexion had turned ashen. Her hands shook, and her eyes darted toward the curtained windows.



She couldn't fathom how netizens who had been hurling stones at Gabriela just yesterday had,overnight, turned their pitchforks on her. Now they were at her very doorstep, and it overwhelmed her.


Questions spun in her mind, each one colder than the last.



What was she supposed to do now? And,her future?What would her friends think of her now? Could she still command the room, bask in the glow of admirers,like before? Her chest tightened; panic threatened to spill over.


Seeing her unravel, Dustin wrapped his arms around her. "Don't be afraid. We'll handle this. I've already called the police. They'll be here soon to clear out the crowd."



Josh was baffled. "Marie, explain this to me. Didn't we already agree to give the house back to Gabriela?So why the hell are we still being dragged through the mud like this?"



Marie's eyes narrowed, her tone a mix of disdain and resentment. "Because your sweet niece isn't just some helpless victim. She knows how to work the crowd. And because your darling sister kept her will from you when she entrusted her daughter to you."She leaned in, each word deliberate. "Call Gabriela.Tell her we'll be out after the New Year. And make it very clear that this mob at our gates needs to vanish.Today."



When Gabriela picked up, Josh's voice cracked instantly. "Gabriela! It's me!" The sound of him crying made something in her chest tighten with guilt, unwelcome but undeniable.No matter what Marie and Phyllis had done, Josh had never treated her with malice.



But guilt wasn't enough to soften her resolve. She'd swallowed her pride for years, enduring quietly, and this was the moment she'd been sharpening her patience for.


The house was just the first domino. Next came the company, until every ounce of power was back in her hands.



"Uncle Josh, I'll make sure everyone knows you've always been good to me," Gabriela said softly, but with an edge beneath it.


That way the public's anger wouldn't reach him.


Josh broke entirely, words tangled with sobs. "I didn't know... God, I didn't know you'd been through all that. Gabriela, I'm so,so sorry."


When his sobs ebbed intosilence,she ended the call  and typed a short message to Farley. "We did it."


After reading the message, Farley looked around at the peeling wallpaper and sagging beams of his home. In his mind, he was back in the glittering boardrooms of years past, standing at Alanna's side,untouchable.



His eyes stung, his jaw tightened.


"I kept my word, Ms. Haynes," he mumbled under his breath.







Aubrey had stayed quiet through the entire online firestorm, watching it burn from the sidelines.


By the time she called Gabriela again, the exhilaration of witnessing Phyllis's downfall had faded.Her voice quivered on the line. "Gabriela, how could your life have been this awful? You must have been so desperate back then. If I'd known you then,I swear I would've ripped Phyllis to shreds for you!"



"| wasn't desperate," Gabriela replied with a soft  laugh that carried a hint of mischief. "If I'd had spare time, I'd have rather spent it on a good meal and a long nap."


Aubrey paused, certain Gabriela was just putting on a brave face. Her voice dropped to a tender murmur. "I really want to hug you right now."


Gabriela smirked. "Go hug Kevin instead. I'm actally in a great mood, and your crying will wreck it."


Aubrey, primed for a teary sisterly moment,blinked at the rejection.



How could Gabriela be so mean?


After ending the call, Gabriela tucked away any trace of emotion, squared her shoulders, and planned to head downstairs to make dinner.


The moment she opened her door, however, she nearly collided with Loretta and Miriam.


Miriam had been glued to every scrap of online gossip about Gabriela. When the mob attacked,she'd dived in headfirst, battling strangers in the  comments section like a knight with a Wi-Fi connection.


When the tide turned, her heart ached for Gabriela's past struggles. She'd grabbed Loretta by the arm,determined to check on Gabriela in person.


They stood outside her room, pacing like sentries,torn between knocking and leaving her in peace.


The moment Gabriela stepped out, Loretta and Miriam turned toward her like sunflowers tracking the light, their faces brimming with tenderness.


Without hesitation, they each wrapped an arm around her, sandwiching her between them.


"You've been through enough, Gabriela," Miriam said firmly. "From now on, this is your home."


"That's right," Loretta chimed in, her tone fierce."Stick by my side and I'd like to see anyone try to mess with you again."


Even Brenden muscled his way into the huddle, his hand landing gently on her shoulder. "Stay strong,  Gabriela. You're the best."



Gabriela couldn't decide whether to laugh or cry.


Yes,the past had carved its marks into her, but she'd never been the type to sit in the ruins and weep over them.



If she'd let grief swallow her whole after her mother's death, she'd never have made it through those endless, poisoned nights under the same roof as Phyllis, who seemed born for the sole purpose of breaking her spirit.


"I'm fine," she said at last, a faint smile tugging at her lips. "So... what are we having for dinner? I'll cook."


"Absolutely not," Loretta replied, finger raised in mock severity. "The garden's in bloom, and you're going to enjoy it. Go walk among the flowers,breathe some fresh air, and let your mind settle. Tonight, I'm the one cooking for you."


With Loretta's order and Miriam's encouraging nod,Gabriela knew resistance was pointless. She gave a lighthearted salute and turned toward the garden path.



Brenden moved as if to follow, but Loretta caught him by the arm.


"And where exactly do you think you're going?" she asked."Come with me."



Brenden's gaze followed Gabriela's retreating figure,and a quiet sigh slipped from him.


She liked him, but he couldn't return the feeling.Better to keep his distance than risk turning things painfully awkward.


So he stayed put beside Loretta.


Out in the garden, Gabriela wandered along the path until her steps slowed.


By a cluster of blossoms stood Wesley. The pale white of his sweater caught the light, setting off the clean lines of his frame. His taIl figure seemed almost carved into the scene, a quiet anchor amidst the spill of color. For a moment, she forgot to breathe.


Wesley, aloof and untouchable as he always was,looked entirely different here, softened by the dappled light and the delicate flowers. There was a refined grace to him now, something almost magnetic.


Gabriela let out a bitter laugh.


He was such a remarkable man, yet his heart held no room for women.


Wesley's gaze shifted, meeting hers. His voice,stripped of its usual cool edge, came low and steady."Come here."
 ###Chapter81 That's Your Advance For Ten Years' Salary
Gabriela jogged toward Wesley, her breath coming in quick bursts.


Wesley's gaze dropped to meet hers, his eyes harboring emotions that churned beneath a carefully controlled surface.



The urge to reach for her clawed at him, but he held himself rigid, afraid one wrong move might send her fleeing.


"Did you deal with the online buzz about you?" he asked, his voice steadier than his racing pulse.


Something unreadable flickered across his features.All she could discern was an unexpected gentleness that made her chest tighten with gratitude.


"Everything's handled! Thank you for caring, Mr.Moss," she replied, her voice warm with appreciation. Wesley studied her face-she had grown up in a suffocating, nightmarish household. Those painful past experiences were now being revisited, tearing open old wounds and exposing them for strangers to dissect and judge.



Yet her eyes remained untainted by the darkness she'd endured.



She was still the bright, captivating Gabriela.


Something shifted in Wesley's expression. Before he could stop himself, his hand moved to the crown of her head, fingers threading gently through her hair."Don't be afraid anymore. You have me now."


Gabriela's smile blazed across her face as she nodded vigorously. "I only found the courage to release those videos and evidence because you stood behind me, Mr. Moss."



Without his protection, she and the financially struggling Farley would have watched helplessly as Marie buried those posts before they could cause any damage. Given Marie's ruthless nature, she would have dispatched thugs to steal the will and driven Tyler's bar into bankruptcy within weeks if she hadn't feared offending Wesley.


Wesley's mouth curved upward before he asked,"Now that you've reclaimed your house, what dreams are you chasing?"


The question caught Gabriela off guard. She blinked,then answered with honest enthusiasm, "I want to stay close to you and earn mountains of money."


Wesley's smile turned to stone.


Was that truly the extent of her ambition?


Unease flickered across Gabriela's face when she noticed his disapproval. "Actually, dreams don't need to be grandiose affairs."


Wesley's response cut through the air like a blade."Craving vast wealth ranks among the most grandiose dreams imaginable."


His expression turned coolly superior, the kind that  reminded her exactly how far her simple mind fell short of his razor-sharp intellect-an intellect that generated wealth at will.


Heat crept up Gabriela's neck. She scrambled for safer ground. "Then I'll aim smaller-maybe deciding what to purchase with my next paycheck, or choosing my next vacation destination."


"What would you buy?" Wesley pressed. "And for this vacation, who would accompany you, and where would you venture?"


Gabriela's temples throbbed. Conversations with Wesley felt like navigating a minefield. Did even imaginary dreams require such exhaustive detail?


She grumbled under her breath, "I haven't gotten my next paycheck yet. Why torture myself thinking about these things?"


A melodic chime interrupted her complaints-her phone's banking alert.


She yanked the device from her pocket with frantic urgency.


One glance at the screen, and the world tilted off its axis.


How many zeros stared back at her?


Gabriela counted the seven digits once. Twice. A wild thought seized her-had scammers grown this sophisticated?


Wesley easily glimpsed her screen. With calm, he announced, "That's your advance for ten years'salary."


Reality crashed over her. Gabriela's words tumbled out in a rush. "There's absolutely no need for advance payment, Mr. Moss. I've already resolved everything."


Thanks to the media storm Phyllis had created,Gabriela hadn't spent a penny of her own money.


Wesley's tone carried that familiar imperial chill. "I specifically ordered the finance department to work overtime calculating your compensation. Now that you've received it, you can'treturn it."


Gabriela's breath caught in her throat.


A decade's salary now sat in her account-a windfall that should have thrilled her. But Wesley's icy tone sent dread pooling in her stomach.


His silky voice continued without missing a beat, "I'm generous enough to waive interest on this ten-year advance. In exchange, during your annual leave periods, you'll provide cooking services at my residence. Unpaid, naturally."


Gabriela's thoughts ground to a complete halt.


Her mind raced through the calculations. Apex Group provided at least half a month of paid vacation annually. Using Loretta's previous offer as a baseline,she'd forfeit forty-five thousand dollars each year.


The realization crushed her spirit.


Wesley had lived up to his ruthless reputation. No matter how gentle or approachable he appeared,beneath that disarming exterior lurked the same  calculating businessman-just wearing a more attractive mask.


She should never have mentioned advance payment.


Wesley observed Gabriela's thunderstruck expression with barely contained amusement.


Fighting back laughter, he delivered the final blow."Additionally, since you've accepted this ten-year advance, you're forbidden from leaving my supervision during business hours. Any leave requests require my personal authorization."


Gabriela stood frozen.



For the next decade, not only would she receive no additional compensation, but she'd essentially become Wesley's indentured servant?


Life truly wielded a double-edged sword. Joy and misery danced together as eternal partners.


She'd just orchestrated Phyllis's downfall, only to deliver herself completely into Wesley's clutches. With this crushing realization weighing on her shoulders, Gabriela lost all desire to admire the surrounding flowers. Even if those blooms were worth fifteen million dollars, they held no meaning for someone trapped in golden chains.


Listless and defeated, she dragged herself back into the living room, steeling her resolve to assist in the kitchen despite everything weighing on her spirit.


Loretta's heart twisted at the sight of Gabriela's dejected posture. She yearned to confront every soul who had ever tormented this girl, forcing them to crawl back with groveling apologies.






Dinner hour arrived with merciless punctuality.Gabriela had crafted a dish, presenting it before Wesley like an offering.


Everyone settled into their seats as the evening meal commenced.



"Mr. Moss, I prepared this barbecue pork belly  specifically for you," Gabriela announced, her voice bright with forced enthusiasm. "No artificial seasonings. It's wholesome and captures the pork's pure, rich essence. Please, taste it."


Wesley found her earnest pride thoroughly entertaining.


With elegant precision, he selected a generous piece and deposited it onto her plate.


"Thank you for your kitchen efforts. You should sample it first," he declared.


Gabriela stared at the glistening, ivory chunk of fat-marbled meat now occupying her plate, and her stomach revolted.


Loretta, thrilled to see Wesley showing concern for Gabriela, chimed in enthusiastically, "Gabriela, please eat up. You're far too slender."


Gabriela longed to protest, but under Loretta's nurturing gaze, she could only force down the fatty pork. The moment she swallowed the last morsel, she craved nothing more than to flee to the opposite end of the continent from Wesley.


As Gabriela discreetly shifted her chair away,her attention snagged on Brenden, who sat across from her, methodically devouring his fish with singular focus.


The longer she observed him, the more confusion prickled at her consciousness.


During their WhatsApp exchanges about meal preferences, Brenden had explicitly rejected numerous dishes. His dietary restrictions had mirrored Wesley's with uncanny precision.


Yet the Brenden before her possessed an adventurous palate that defied all logic. Not only did he consume bland fish daily, but he devoured onions,celery, and even cilantro with apparent relish.


At that precise moment, Brenden lifted a crisp celery stalk and bit down, his expression radiating pure satisfaction. Gabriela's brow furrowed with growing suspicion.


A preposterous theory invaded her thoughts.Could the man sitting before her be an entirely different person from "NotASaunders" on WhatsApp?


While Gabriela wrestled with this absurd possibility,Wesley's voice materialized beside her ear, low and honeyed. "What captivates your attention so completely? Focus on your meal."


Reality crashed back. She glanced down and nearly choked on her dismay.


An even larger, more grotesquely fatty piece of pork now dominated her plate.


She regretted making this dish for Wesley.


Never again would she dare attempt such "revenge"against Wesley.


Look on the bright side-that ten-year advance had catapulted her bank balance into seven glorious figures. Surely that would sweeten even the chore of cooking for Wesley during her precious leave. She gnawed through the greasy meat while silently swearing this cursed dish would never contaminate Wesley's table again.


Wesley observed her tortured expression and felt an unexpected pang of sympathy.


But when his gaze drifted to Brenden, his features hardened with renewed irritation.


His displeasure ran bone-deep.
###Chapter82 Doubt





Gabriela swallowed the last bite of fatty meat with difficulty, her mind still wrestling with Wesley's sudden shift in demeanor.


A wave of melancholy washed over her, souring what should have been a pleasant meal.


Wesley disappeared into his study immediately after dinner,burying himself in his reading.


Loretta and Miriam shooed Gabriela away from the cleanup duty, insisting she unwind or lose herself in her phone instead.



These two wonderful women genuinely treasured her presence, and their kindness stirred something deep within Gabriela's chest. In that moment, she realized that returning here annually to cook without payment wouldn't feel like such a burden after all.


Wesley might be a heartless businessman, but she could set aside her frustrations with him for the warmth that Loretta and Miriam offeredI her.


The bitter cold kept Gabriela indoors that evening.She retreated to her room, where she settled in to scroll through her phone.


Her name continued trending across social media platforms, with countless netizens offering apologies while unleashing criticism on Phyllis.


After scanning through the flood of comments,Gabriela switched to lifestyle content.


As she watched, Brenden's unusual eating preferences suddenly surfaced in her memory.


Curiosity overwhelmed her restraint, and she opened WhatsApp.


Her conversation with "NotASaunders" remained frozen at their last exchange from several days prior -when she had confronted Brenden about his wedding behavior, only to receive his terse response."ldiot." Gabriela's mind drifted back to those first two months of her company internship.


She had worked in the sales department while Brenden commanded all four sales divisions as general manager, creating frequent opportunities for interaction.



Her memories painted him as an incurable charmer-every beautiful woman became his target.


His generosity toward his girlfriends flowed freely,and his words dripped like honey from his lips.


Never once had Brenden called any woman an "idiot"-this much remained crystal clear in her recollection.



Yet their WhatsApp history revealed multiple instances of him hurling that exact insult her way.


The person who actually favored that particular word around her was...


Gabriela's pulse hammered against her ribcage. Her memory confirmed it-Wesley had indeed branded her an "idiot" on several occasions during face-to-face encounters.


She reread their entire chat thread, mentally superimposing Wesley's personality onto each message, her astonishment growing with every line.


"NotASaunders" possessed a communication style that mirrored Wesley's with startling accuracy.


Another vital clue lurked in his username:"NotASaunders."


Perhaps the person behind these messages wasn't Brenden at all.


Could it possibly be...


The instant this thought crystallized, Gabriela shook her head with violent denial.


How could Wesley possibly masquerade as Brenden?What purpose would such deception serve?


Here was a man who generated millions in mere minutes-why would Wesley squander his precious time on WhatsApp messages with her?


She was definitely mistaken in her speculation.


But if "NotASaunders" wasn't Brenden, then w/ho could it be?



Despite her carefree exterior, Gabriela possessed a proactive core. Once suspicion took root, she demanded immediate confirmation.



She headed downstairs in search of Brenden.



He had sprawled across the couch in complete relaxation, fingers dancing across his phone screen.


His casual posture created a jarring contrast with the somewhat distant "NotASaunders" persona from WhatsApp.



Though the sight caught her off guard, the timing was perfect-no one else was nearby. Gabriela steeled her resolve and called out, "Mr. Saunders."


Her voice triggered an immediate transformation as Brenden bolted upright, straightening his spine,smoothing his clothes, and running fingers through his disheveled hair, embarrassment coloring his features.



Relaxation came naturally to him, and his cousin's couch possessed an almost supernatural comfort.


The familiarity had made him completely forget that Gabriela was staying in the house and could descend the stairs at any moment.


He wondered if his slovenly appearance had diminished her opinion of him.


After clearing his throat, Brenden asked with earnest attention, "Gabriela, is there something you need from me?"


"Actually, yes." Gabriela summoned her courage and pressed forward. "When will you return what belongs to me?"



Confusion clouded Brenden's expression. "I'm not following you." "I mean the item I left with you."


Gabriela couldn't bring herself to mention their one-night stand. Besides, she wasn't even sure whether Brenden was the man who had slept with her. Explicit details were absolutely out of the question.



"Something you left with me?" Brenden's bewilderment deepened. "I have no recollection of you leaving anything in my possession."


Gabriela's breath caught in her throat as her mind began spinning wildly.


"NotASaunders" truly wasn't Brenden?


To confirm this, she posed another question."Mr.Saunders, please stop this charade. You explicitly promised that if I prepared something delicious for you,you would return what's mine.So much time has passed-please don't delay any further."


Sympathy pierced Brenden's heart as he observed Gabriela's pallor and the careful hesitation in her voice. Harshness toward beautiful women simply wasn't in his nature, especially when Gabriela ranked as the most stunning woman he had ever encountered.



He searched his memory desperately, trying to recall what precious item of hers might have fallen into his possession.


Suddenly, her obvious crush on him flashed through his mind, and he wondered with growing incredulity if the thing she had left with him was... her heart!


Gabriela even thought that by cooking for him, he might develop feelings for her.


Was this the real reason she had chosen to sacrifice her holiday and work as a chef here?



A complex mix of flattery and unease stirred within Brenden's chest. While his natural charm drew admirers, the notion that Gabriela harbored such profound feelings-enough to surrender her heart entirely-felt staggering in its intensity.


What had sparked such overwhelming devotion within her?



A strange tension crossed Brenden's face-just enough to make Gabriela second-guess herself.She ventured forward with delicate uncertainty, "Mr.Saunders?"



Wesley emerged at that precise moment,water glass in hand, and the scene before him brought his steps to an abrupt halt.



Brenden gazed down at Gabriela with unmistakable smugness painted across his features, while she waited for his words with an almost childlike vulnerability etched into her face.


A cold snort escaped Wesley's lips as he swept his gaze over Gabriela with withering brevity, then strode past without acknowledging their existence.


Gabriela froze.



That fleeting look Wesley had cast her way-though subtle and seemingly emotionless-carried the weight of crushing judgment. Her mind raced with questions about how much of their conversation he had witnessed and whether his sharp intellect had already pieced together the fragments.


Anxiety bloomed like poison in her veins, making her desperate to flee to the sanctuary of her room.


But Brenden's voice suddenly cut through her spiraling thoughts. "Gabriela, forgive me. I cannot provide what you're seeking."


The realization of her deep-seated affection sent a brief surge of euphoria through Brenden's system,but reality quickly doused that flame.


Every woman who had graced his life-from minor celebrities to runway models-had been drawn like moths to the golden glow of his wealth, their affections as artificial as stage makeup. He understood this transaction perfectly and had never minded, since his own heart remained equally shallow.



Gabriela represented something entirely different-a rare gem of authenticity in his world of calculated relationships.


As someone who fled from commitment like it was a contagious disease, he couldn't offer her the fairy-tale ending she deserved, nor could he bear to string her along with false promises.


With this resolution crystallizing in his mind, Brenden delivered his verdict with unwavering finality."Moving forward, we should sever all contact between us. Should our paths cross again, we must behave as complete strangers."


He pivoted on his heel and departed without a backward glance, his footsteps echoing with decisive determination.



Gabriela stood frozen in bewilderment.


What the hell did Brenden mean by that?

###Chapter83 Could You Sing Something For Me
Even after Brenden's figure vanished from sight,Gabriela remained frozen in place, her mind reeling.


She had suspected that "NotASaunders" wasn't Brenden at all, but judging by his reaction moments ago, was she wrong in her speculation?


And what had Brenden meant when he claimed he couldn't give her what she wanted? Was he planning to keep whatever she'd left in that hotel room?


Fury blazed through Gabriela's chest.


Brenden showered other women with generosity,yet treated her with such calculated cruelty. He kept stalling,refusing to return what belonged to her.


What an absolute bastard!



Gabriela drew a shuddering breath, forcing her rage into submission.



When she considered it rationally, this outcome worked in her favor. Brenden had suggested cutting contact himself, whch meant no future scandals to worry about.


Besides, she couldn't even recall what she'd abandoned in that hotel room-she probably didn't need it anyway.


Her thoughts churned through a dozen emotions,and gradually, satisfaction replaced her anger.


The crushing weight that had pressed against her ribs finally lifted.


She inhaled deeply, transforming back into the carefree woman she'd always been.


"Gabriela."



Wesley's frigid voice cut through her reverie like a blade.


Her euphoria had made her forget Wesley still lingered in the living room.


Thank God she hadn't been too explicit while testing Brenden earlier-Wesley probably hadn't deciphered their cryptic exchange.


She flashed him a brilliant smile. "Mr. Moss,getting some water? I won't keep you."


Gabriela finished speaking and bolted toward her room.


She indulged in a scalding shower, so blissful she nearly burst into song.


After toweling off, Gabriela scrolled through her phone until 11:30 PM crept up on her.


She'd planned to stay awake another half hour, but tomorrow's responsibilities crashed back into her consciousness-Loretta needed help decorating the house and trimming the garden's overgrown trees and flowers. She'd have to rise at dawn.



Gabriela powered down her phone, burrowed into her blankets, and set her alarm.  Just as sleep began to claim her, WhatsApp's distinctive chime pierced the silence.



It rang several times in succession.


Gabriela cracked open her phone to discover a message from "NotASaunders."


"Are you sleeping? I can't rest. Could you sing something for me?"


Gabriela stared at the screen in disbelief.


Brenden had just declared he wouldn't return her belongings or contact her again, and now he already changed his mind?



What an asshole!



Having already confronted Brenden directly, Gabriela felt no need for diplomacy. Her reply dripped with venom.



"Brenden Saunders, do you possess the memory span of a goldfish? What is it- three seconds before everything evaporates? You explicitly said never to  contact me again, so why are you messaging me now?"


Wesley had been battling insomnia for days.


Gabriela's rejection had wounded him, though he convinced himself he wasn't particularly attached to her.



Since she possessed such abysmal taste as to criticize his physique, he certainly wouldn't waste another moment's consideration on her.


He'd assumed he would get over her quickly.


But recently, she haunted his vision constantly.


He learned that she had endured absolute darkness in the past while still maintaining such radiant optimism.


Rather than moving on from her, his fascination intensified.


Tonight, he'd tossed restlessly, his mind replaying the scene of Gabriela standing before Brenden. He was quite frustrated.


Damn! What was so special about Brenden that had drawn her to him?



Irritation drove Wesley to message Gabriela,requesting a song.


He hadn't anticipated provoking such fierce indignation.


Reading her message, in which she furiously berated Brenden, somehow lifted Wesley's spirits considerably.Her fiery temperament amused him.


He responded cheerfully, "Oh, it's Gabriela?thought this was girlfriend number forty-three. Sorry,wrong recipient."


Finding that insufficient, Wesley added, "My forty-third girlfriend happens to bea little singer. If you can outperform her, I'll return your possessions immediately."


Gabriela's blood boiled.  Why was he tormenting her in the dead of night?


She needed to wake early tomorrow to assist Loretta with decorating!



Gabriela marshaled her fury, prepared a verbal assault, and readied a voice message bombardment when "NotASaunders" sent another text.



"I'm a free spirit; naturally, I change my mind constantly Forget what I said earlier. Tonight, you wil sing for me."


Gabriela was about to detonate.



But what choice did she have? Her own reckless behavior had created this mess-getting drunk over trivial matters, which had attracted this relentless pest.


Terrified that Brenden might broadcast their one-night stand, Gabriela swallowed her rage.


She clenched her jaw and typed, "What song do you want?"The response materialized instantly. "Something romantic."



Gabriela's blood chilled.


What kind of delusional romantic was Brenden,demanding love songs in the dead of night?


Even if she knew a hundred romantic ballads,she wouldn't feed his twisted fantasies.


"I don't know any romantic songs," Gabriela shot back.



"Then find one. Sing something sweet once you've chosen.I have all night-I'll wait."


Gabriela drew a savage breath, mentally executing Brenden a dozen different ways before hitting record.Her voice emerged barely above a whisper.


"If I could do just one thing for you..."


This marked the first time she'd ever performed for someone through her phone. Shyness scorched her cheeks. Initially, her voice trembled with embarrassment.


The recording automatically transmitted when it reached the sixty-second limit.


Gabriela's voice wasn't classically beautiful,but her tender singing caressed the listener like whispered secrets.



Wesley had initially found it enchanting, even losing himself in her melody as he contemplated which song to request next.



But as the lyrics unfolded, his smile withered.


"Love you so deeply, so I'll set you free..."


Wesley's expression turned thunderous.


Loving someone so profoundly, yet releasing them?Encouraging them to choose another?


Shouldn't loving someone mean clutching them desperately and never letting go?


These lyrics were absolute poison!  Wesley fired back immediately, "Awful. Choose something else."


Gabriela, who had been pleased with her performance, recoiled at his brutal dismissal.
###Chapter84 No One Should Expect An Easy Night
Gabriela rolled her eyes when she read the message.Brenden thought her singing was awful.


Well, fine-she didn't feel like singing anymore anyway.



She quickly fired off a reply. "I think my singing's terrible too. It's late, and I need to sleep. Goodnight,Mr.Saunders!"



Wesley, who had felt his irritation subside earlier,experienced a fresh surge of annoyance.


He typed back with barely contained frustration, "No sleeping.Keep singing."


Something strange stirred in Gabriela tonight-an unusual patience that surprised even her. "What would you like to hear this time?"
Wesley rarely indulged in pop music, but after scrolling through various options, he typed back with deliberate slowness, "'We Will Rock You'."


Gabriela stared at her screen in disbelief.


The urge to reach through the digital barrier and throttle this man nearly overwhelmed her.


She fired back without hesitation, "I don't know how to sing that song."


"Then learn it. If you can't master it in one attempt,try ten times. You'll eventually succeed."


Gabriela's eyes rolled skyward as she replied, "This song is incredibly challenging. I wouldn't master it no matter how long I practiced."


"Oh? Should I broadcast our one-night stand to the world?"



Gabriela inhaled deeply, forcing down the rage that threatened to consume her.



Another message from "NotASaunders" appeared on  her screen. "Take your time learning. I'm in no hurry."


He wasn't in a hurry, but sleepiness overtook Gabriela!


During her university years, Gabriela had absorbed countless pop songs, so learning this one wouldn't prove impossible.


After summoning her courage and steeling her nerves, Gabriela delivered a few ragged lines into her device.


Wesley struggled to define the emotions coursing through him.0


Gabriela's pristine, melodic voice clashed terribly with this particular song.


He typed mercilessly, "You call that singing? You're shrieking. It's kind of sonic assault, and my ears are bleeding."


Gabriela's throat burnedfrom the vocal assault, and she could no longer endure Brenden's relentless criticism. She launched herself from her bed, grabbed a coat,flung open her door, and marched to Brenden's room with fierce determination.


Her movements possessed swift, deadly purpose.


But when Brenden answered his door, Gabriela's fury evaporated like morning mist.


What was she doing here?


Would she argue with Brenden or challenge him to a confrontation?


If she pursued either course, not only Wesley, but Loretta and Miriam would discover what happened between them.



Losing her job paled in comparison to facing the shock in Loretta's and Miriam's eyes.


She genuinely adored Loretta and Miriam and treasured their affection like precious gems.


She dreamed of spending the coming year celebrating New Year's with them. Brenden was furious about being awakened after barely falling asleep. But when he opened the door and discovered Gabriela standing there with a sorrowful expression, unexpected unease pierced through his irritation.


"Gabriela, why aren't you sleeping yet?" he inquired.


Gabriela studied his face, impressed by his act.


He played dumb so convincingly that one could almost believe him.


Gabriela pierced him with an icy glare, spun on her heel, and stalked away.


She slammed her door with finality and snatched up her phone with renewed determination.


Didn't Brenden think her singing was atrocious? Well,she would continue her vocal assault until he begged for mercy.


Gabriela channeled every ounce of her fury and unleashed her full power, roaring through the entire song. Wesley could taste Gabriela's resentment, enduring the genuine risk of permanent hearing damage to listen to her complete performance.


He finally delivered his verdict. "You make my forty-third girlfriend sound like a Grammy winner."


Gabriela had anticipated this exact response.


Brenden always imposed impossible demands, and when she finally met them, he would begin his surgical dissection of her efforts.


Damn! He clearly had no intention of showing her mercy!


Fine. No one should expect an easy night!


Gabriela typed with calculated sweetness, "Mr.Saunders, have you heard 'I Will Always Love You'?It's another challenging high-pitched song. How about granting me another opportunityto attempt it?"


Wesley, lounging against his bed, chose not to expose her transparent strategy, responding with a single word, "Sure."


Gabriela's eyes gleamed with newfound purpose.This time, she initiated a voice chat instead of sending a recording.


She was determined to discover if the voice on the other end truly belonged to Brenden!


But after connecting, silence stretched between them. Even when Gabriela greeted him, no response came.


Gabriela cleared her throat with theatrical precision."Alright, I'll begin singing."


The opening section of "I Will Always Love You"flowed gently, and combined with Gabriela's naturally sweet voice, it created an unexpectedly pleasant sound.


Wesley's lips curved upward in the faintest smile.


But the next moment, his phone erupted with piercing high notes, her voice cracking under the strain. Gabriela possessed no proper technique, relying purely on raw volume for the high notes, creating a truly ear-shattering performance.


Wesley nearly hurled his phone across the room.


Gabriela sang with increasing intensity. Wesley considered lowering the volume, but something inexplicable held him back.



After enduring the complete song, neither of them felt victorious.



Gabriela, her voice now completely hoarse, asked,"Mr. Saunders, was it good?"


When silence greeted her question, she pressed on,"I have another song prepared, and I wonder if you..."


Before she could complete her sentence, the voice call ended abruptly.


"NotASaunders" sent a message. "This performance was marginally better than your previous attempt.Practice more."

 Gabriela's throat felt like it was on fire, and seeing this message made her head throb with mounting frustration.


But Brenden's unpredictable nature proved too formidable to challenge. Gabriela recognized she was outmatched.


Forget it. Exhaustion had claimed her. No more battles tonight.


She surrendered!



Gabriela sipped warm water, burrowed under her covers, and soon surrendered to sleep.



In her dreams, she kept singing song after song.When she woke up in the morning and reflected on those dreams, she felt awful.


She dressed and descended the stairs, colliding directly with Brenden's path.



The dreams blazed through her mind, and Gabriela fixed Brenden with a murderous stare. Brenden recoiled under Gabriela's venomous glare,then noticed the dark shadows beneath her eyes,guilt twisting deeper into his chest.

What had possessed such a wonderful woman to develop feelings for him?


After delivering her withering look, Gabriela turned to discover Wesley seated on the sofa, absorbed in his newspaper.


Today he wore a black turtleneck sweater that transformed him into something both devastating and untouchable-handsome yet shrouded in mystery.


When he noticed her presence, Wesley offered the slightest nod of acknowledgment.


Gabriela's heart performed an unexpected somersault.


Last night, suspicion had crept through her thoughts like poison-could "NotASaunders" actually be Wesley? Now she found that possibility absurd. How could such a magnificent CEO stoop to impersonating Brenden? The very idea contradicted everything about his character!


Besides, Wesley had no interest in women-definitely not the man who had slept with her!


Gabriela exchanged polite greetings with Wesley before escaping to the kitchen's sanctuary.


Loretta and Miriam had already risen, their voices filled with maternal concern as they urged Gabriela toward rest.


"Let me handle breakfast. Your foot is still recovering -go sit outside," Loretta cooed.


"Yes, spend time with Mr. Moss. It will strengthen your working relationship," Miriam chimed in.


But Gabriela stood her ground with stubborn determination. "My foot healed ages ago. Please,let me take care of this."


Faced with Gabriela's unwavering resolve, they reluctantly abandoned the kitchen. The moment solitude embraced her, Gabriela swiftly prepared honey lemon water.


After her night of vocal torture, her throat felt like sandpaper, and even the soothing mixture provided minimal relief.


Righteous anger burning in her veins, she began crafting something special for Brenden.


Her hands moved with vengeful efficiency,completing the mea preparations with remarkable speed.


Finally, she positioned her carefully orchestrated breakfast before Brenden, her smile radiating deceptive sweetness. "Mr. Saunders, I noticed you had a restless night, so I prepared something special to energize your morning."


Brenden's expression clouded with confusion.


He had been sleeping peacefully yesterday when Gabriela's unexpected visit shattered his dreams.


Wesley, drawn by their conversation, folded his newspaper with precise movements and approached them.
###Chapter85 His Undeniable Charm





Before Brenden sat a dish of baked custard studded with apples.


The apples, thinly sliced and artfully layered,were nestled in a creamy custard, baked to a golden, firm finish.


Regardless of its flavor, the dish was undeniably visually appealing.



Wesley's lips tightened, his eyes turning cold.


She clearly put in genuine effort for Brenden's breakfast, yet for him, she had previously made some awful greasy fried meat.


Unaware that his dish was a disaster, Brenden was so moved he nearly welled up.


Since childhood, aside from Loretta, no one had shown him such kindness.
At that moment, Loretta and Miriam joined them at the table.


Deeply touched, Brenden declared, "Gabriela made this special breakfast for me. Of course I'll savor every bite."


He scooped a generous spoonful of custard.


The instant it hit his tongue, his pleased expression faltered, replaced by a grimace.


It was so salty!


Had Gabriela emptied the entire salt canister into it?


Catching her glance, he noticed a flicker of smug triumph mixed with quiet anger, and it clicked.


In his mind, Gabriela's affection had twisted into mischief. If she couldn't have him, she'd sabotage him.


Well, it was all because of his undeniable charm.


Having let Gabriela down, he figured he deserved her punishment. Brenden forced down the custard, maintaining a neutral expression. With a bright smile, he fibbed,"Gabriela, your cooking is incredible. This is truly delicious."


Gabriela stared, at a loss for words.


Wasn't that much salt enough to make him wince?


Noticing her icy glare, Brenden fell silent but continued to choke down the custard. Leaning toward Wesley, he whispered, "I think Gabriela's way too into me."


Wesley shot him a cold glance, saying nothing.


Brenden pressed on, "This breakfast is overly salty,but it must've taken her ages to make. She's punishing me with this because I couldn't return her feelings. Gabriela's such a great girl. Why would she fall for someone like me? I've really disappointed her."


He muttered as he ate, unable to contain himself.


His overwhelming charm demanded to be acknowledged, or his ego would burst.


Wesley's fists clenched subtly, tempted to silence him.



Picking up an apple, he said casually, "Grandma,Brenden's eating something this salty so early. It is not good for his health. He needs some exercise."


Due to Wesley's past health concerns, Loretta was particularly attentive to the younger family members'well-being.


Alarmed, she tasted the custard and found it unbearably salty.


Yet Brenden had already consumed over half.


Loretta promptly declared, "Brenden, after breakfast,you're exercising with me."


Brenden protested, "NNo need, Loretta. I'm fine."


Loretta was resolute. "It's not up to you. If I say you need it, you do!"


Brenden respected Loretta deeply. Thus, he didn't dare defy her and reluctantly agreed.


Gabriela silently admired Loretta's decisiveness. Well played!


After breakfast, Loretta sent Brenden on a short walk to aid digestion. Thirty minutes later, he was to exercise in the garden's fresh air.


Then Loretta turned to Gabriela, her tone warm."Is your foot fully healed,Gabriela?"


Gabriela nodded quickly. "It's been fine for two days now."



"Could you help me hang the New Year's garlands?"Loretta asked.


Gabriela's eyes sparkled. "I'd love to!"


She'd never participated in such meaningful traditions before.


This year, she could finally join in.


Pleased with her enthusiasm, Loretta turned to Wesley. "You'll hang the garlands, and Gabriela will assist."



Wesley's face clouded with a touch of reluctance.


Such tasks were typically left to staff. As CEO of Apex Group, was he really being asked to do something so mundane?


Noticing his hesitation, Loretta planted her hands on her hips. "Well? Are you doing it or not?"


Wesley didn't want to upset her, so he relented.Sighing,he stood. "I'll do it."


"Change your clothes first," Loretta instructed. "It's the New Year, and you're always in black or white.What's that about? Look at Gabriela in her vibrant red-so festive."



Gabriela's red coat highlighted her delicate complexion, enhancing her beauty.


The more Loretta observed her, the more she adored Gabriela. She wished that Wesley would marry Gabriela right away. "Do I really need to change?" Wesley protested.


His wardrobe was almost entirely monochrome.



"Yes," Loretta insisted, producing a red T-shirt she'd prepared. "Wear this."


Wesley's expression darkened at the sight of the T-shirt.



Under Loretta's firm gaze, he reluctantly donned the T-shirt, rolled up his sleeves, and began hanging the garlands.



Gabriela observed in quiet awe as Loretta accomplished what no one else could-silencing Wesley's objections with a single look and bending him to her will.


Loretta glanced at her. "Why are you just standing there,Gabriela? Go help."



A quiet satisfaction warmed her chest-she'd engineered this moment perfectly. She hoped their relationship would blossom. Brenden, watching the scene unfold, was caught off guard when Loretta turned to him. "Brenden, let's go.Time to exercise."


He trailed her into the garden, quietly calculating that at her age, she wouldn't last long with exercise.


To his dismay, a chiseled, forty-something man awaited-Cassius Padilla, a well-known personal trainer with over a million Instagram followers.


His presence during the New Year was thanks to Wesley's personal request.


Brenden's confidence wavered. This wasn't looking good.


Loretta instructed Cassius to give Brenden a thorough workout, then returned with Miriam to watch Gabriela and Wesley.


Wesley stood atop a ladder, with Gabriela passing garlands to him.


For novices, they worked in surprising harmony,their striking appearances making them a captivating  sight.


Still, Loretta felt a pang of worry. "Wesley is not interested in women. I wonder if Gabriela could work her magic and make him fall for her."


Miriam's eyes sparkled with an idea. "Remember that scarf Gabriela knitted a few days ago? What if..."


After hearing her plan, Loretta remained doubtful about its merit.



Miriam's schemes had never succeeded before.


"This time, it'll work!" Miriam said confidently."Mr.Moss is not as cold-hearted as he appears. If he really rejects a lovely woman's advances..."


Loretta's heart skipped a beat. Would it mean he'd never be interested in women?



"Don't worry," Miriam said calmly. "If that's the case,we'll use our trump card."


Though doubtful, Loretta decided to trust her.

###Chapter86 You Look So Silly





Although the servants hovered nearby, eager to assist, Loretta briskly shooed them away to tend to other duties.


That left Wesley alone at the front door, wrestling with the decorations.



He soon found his hands were stained with grimy dust, and his left cheek bore the marks as well.


The sight of the usually composed, untouchable man in such a state was unexpectedly comical.


Gabriela couldn't hold back her laughter. "Mr. Moss,your face is covered in dust! You look so silly."


Her laughter rang out, light and melodic, though it seemed to grate on him.


Without a word, he leaned forward and brushed his hand across her cheek. "There! Now yours is dirty too!"



Gabriela froze, momentarily stunned.


Was he truly being this childish?


She rolled up her sleeves and boldly reached for his other cheek with her dirty hand. Her fingertips skimmed his cheek, light as silk.


The touch shouldn't have meant anything, and yet Wesley's chest tightened as if she'd struck a chord he didn't know existed.



In one swift motion, his hand closed around her wrist.His gaze locked on hers, dark and unwavering, the kind of stare that made the air feel heavier.


Gabriela froze, pulse skipping. Perhaps, she had taken things too far.


After all, he was her boss, and she shouldn't have teased him like this.



It was very inappropriate.


One corner of his mouth twitched as he let her go, though the weight of his hand lingered like a brand."Stop messing around."


"Understood," she said quickly, absently tracing the very spot his hand had touched.


His presence made her breath hitch in her throat,and a flush warmed her cheeks.


Tugging at her collar, she shrugged off her jacket to cool herself.



Beneath it, a soft lavender T-shirt hugged her frame,the round neckline drawing attention to her collarbones.



Wesley's gaze flickered there for a split second before he turned away. "Stop dawdling. Some of us have real work to do."



Gabriela bent to retrieve the decorations, and the hem of her T-shirt rose, offering a fleeting glimpse of bare skin. Wesley's gaze flickered and immediately averted.



Who could have guessed that hanging streamers and ornaments wvould test him more than sealing billion-dollar contracts overseas?



Fortunately, his earlier warning had her working with the focus of an employee on a strict deadline.



With her newfound seriousness, the second floor was finished in no time.



Loretta's orders didn't end at the villa. Now the garden's trees and flowers were waiting for their festive touch.



Gabriela trailed after Wesley, but before they could begin, a sharp, pained cry split the air.


"Ah! Stop! That hurts. Don't push it any further!"


The source of the commotion became clear a moment later. It was Brenden, locked in an unfortunate stretching session with Cassius. Or rather, Cassius was doing the stretching, and Brenden was doing the suffering.



Brenden, clearly unaccustomed to anything more strenuous than lifting a wine glass, was flailing under Cassius's iron grip.


"Cassius, I swear my leg's about to snap! I don't want muscles like yours. Just take it easy, alright? No need for the full drill-sergeant routine!"


Cassius's expression didn't budge. "What do you think I'm being paid for? Standing around?"


With merciless precision, he pressed Brenden's bent knee down even further.


Another tortured yell ripped from Brenden's throat.


Gabriela's eye twitched with part sympathy,part schadenfreude.


What a way to spend the holiday season.


Then again... maybe he deserved it.


Beside her, Wesley shot her a glacial look, holding it for several long seconds before his voice came, cool and cutting. "Grandma told you to decorate the garden. Not stand around gawking."


Gabriela quickly tore her eyes away, fumbling for an excuse. "I wasn't gawking.I was admiring that man's muscles."



Wesley's brow furrowed, his mood souring.


Muscles? He had muscles. He even had abs, for heaven's sake.


Why didn't she choose to admire his muscles instead?



Gabriela, oblivious to the silent offense, noticed Wesley's expression and sighed inwardly. He was upset again, but by now, she was accustomed to his unpredictable moods.


"Mr. Moss," she said quickly, "how about we start with that tree?"


Without waiting for his reply, she strode toward the tree and pressed a bright red decoration ontoits trunk.


Still, the shift in her focus seemed to cool his irritation, and Wesley joined her. Soon the sprawling garden was draped in festive reds and golds.


Gabriela stepped back to admire their work. "Much better. Now the place feels cozy."


Wesley surveyed his meticulously curated garden-where every bush and blossom usually existed in perfect harmony.


Now, the gaudy decorations clashed like cymbals in a symphony.


His jaw tightened, but he swallowed the criticism.Loretta's orders trumped aesthetics.


A few hours later, the last ribbon was tied and the final ornament hung. Wesley retreated to his room,with the thought of changing out of his glaringly red clothes.



But he paused, remembering Gabriela in her own red jacket, the way it had made her eyes sparkle.


In the end, he didn't change. At the sink, he splashed water on his face, but the memory of her bright, mischievous eyes as she brushed her dirty hands across his cheek returned unbidden, making his heartbeat quicken.


That silly girl...


Meanwhile, Gabriela, having finished her tasks,could still hear Brenden's pitiful cries drifting from his training session with CassiuIs.


Loretta's brow creased. "So young, yet Brenden can't get through two hours of exercise without screaming? Truly pathetic."


But with New Year's just around the corner,summoning Cassius again felt entirely inappropriate.


After a brief exchange, Loretta and Miriam decided to have two strong, young servants in the coming days to help Brenden with his leg stretches.


Even during the holidays, exercise couldn't be overlooked.



Their discussion concluded, and both women turned to her, their smiles warm and genuine.


"Gabriela, you've worked hard today. Skip lunch; you don't need to cook," Loretta told her.


Gabriela hesitated, about to protest.


Even as Wesley's unpaid cook, she never let her duties slide.


Miriam, however, stepped in smoothly. "Mrs. Larson has another task for you."


Gabriela's curiosity was immediately piqued. "Oh?What task?"


The villa was fully decorated; surely there was nothing she needed to help with.


Loretta's eyes softened. "Where's that scarf you were knitting last time? Let me see it."


Without a second thought, Gabriela dashed back to her room to retrieve the scarf.


Loretta and Miriam admired her handiwork, then exchanged a glance before Loretta asked, "It still 
needs a little more. Why haven't you finished it yet?"


Gabriela's cheeks tinged pink. "I've... been a bit busy lately."



"Don't worry," Loretta said with a reassuring smile."Start knitting now, and by evening, it'll be ready for sure."



Gabriela hesitated for a moment, unsure of Loretta's intentions-but she couldn't refuse her request."Alright, I'll do my best."


Then Gabriela settled into her room, hands moving rhythmically over the scarf as Loretta and Miriam busied themselves in the kitchen preparing lunch.



As mealtime approached, Miriam slipped into the study to summon Wesley.


He entered to see a table laid with dishes, their aroma unmistakably Loretta's handiwork.



"Isn't Gabriela cooking today?" he asked, eyebrows slightly raised. "She's got a very important task," Miriam replied, her tone deliberately cryptic. "She's knitting a scarf.l heard she wants to finish it before New Year's and give it to the person who means the most to her."


Wesley's chest tightened, and his heart skipped a beat.





The person who means the most to Gabriela?


Who could that be?

###Chapter87 He Was The One





Miriam shot Loretta a sly, conspiratorial glance, and Loretta instantly caught on, turning toward Wesley."Whoever that person is, Gabriela must really like them. Wesley, who do you think she's giving the scarf to?"



Wesley's face stayed composed, but the subtle curl of his fingers at his side betrayed him, his knuckles whitening under the strain.


His voice was cool, almost bored. "How the hell am1supposed to know that?"


Loretta's brow creased as she exchanged a puzzled look with Miriam.


Why the sudden frost? Just earlier, while they were decorating the villa, there'd been a flicker of connection.



Miriam, ever the strategist, flicked her gaze at Loretta in a silent warning not to push him.


If the scarf didn't draw him out, she still had a far more cunning play up her sleeve.


Meanwhile, Brenden lingered nearby, his ears pricked, drinking in every word.


Every muscle in his body throbbed, his legs so sore he could barely stand, yet Brenden's towering narcissism refused to take a second off.


Oh no! Was Gabriela actually considering giving the scarf to him?



And if she did, what then? Accept it? Refuse?


They had agreed to cut ties, to walk past each other like strangers.



Why couldn't she just let that be? She was hopelessly taken with him, and it complicated everything between them.


Brenden let out an exasperated sigh, muttering complaints under his breath. Wesley heard every word, his face an unreadable mask.



So, still self-absorbed. Clearly, one trainer hadn't been enough for Brenden.


Wesley was planning on bringing another.


When Gabriela finally stepped into the dining room,her gaze collided with Wesley's, his eyes burning with restrained fury. A pang of unease tugged at her.She knew how valuable his time was, and yet here she was, making him wait. Perhaps she really had been pushing her luck.



Gabriela couldn't bear to meet Wesley's gaze any longer. As soon as she turned her head, there was Brenden, slouched over the dining table, one hand braced against his waist, looking thoroughly pitiful.


The sight stirred a strange mix of satisfaction, tinged with sympathy.


What was the point of hurting each other like this?She really should find a moment to talk to Brenden. That night still haunted her with regret. Still, she clung to the belief that time could mend even the deepest rifts.



If Brenden would just let her go, maybe then, given enough time, she could forget what happened between them.



Determined to ignore Wesley's simmering stare,Gabriela focused on her meal, eating quickly.


Afterward, the moment she was waiting for arrived-a chance to pull Brenden aside and speak with him privately.


To the left of the manor lay a still pond, a jagged mass of artificial rock guarding its edge.



Brenden,desperate to avoid Loretta roping him into yet another round of exercise that afternoon, slipped behind the stone, hiding like a fugitive.



After an hour and a half of brutal leg stretches that morning, his knees no longer remembered how to bend.Slumping against the cold rock, he let out a sharp hiss of pain.



So this was what happened when a woman didn't get the man she wanted. The outcome was absolutely terrifying.


Still, the moment Gabriela's delicate features floated into his mind, the irritation drained away.



Fine. No more pushing her buttons.



Rubbing at his aching knees, he made up his mind that once the New Year season was over, he'd head back to his own place-putting much-needed distance between them.



He was mid-thought when Gabriela's voice suddenly drifted over. "Mr. Saunders?"


He jolted upright in alarm and instantly regretted it.Pain tore through his knee like it had been struck with an iron rod. His face twisted, but he still managed to throw up a hand.


"Don't come here!" he barked. Gabriela froze mid-step.


Since she wanted this talk to go well, she decided to lead with sincerity. From a cautious three meters away, she said loudly, "I'm sorry about this morning..."



"Stop." The moment her face came into view,Brenden's pulse kicked up. He tore his gaze away,unwilling to risk looking at her too long. "We agreed yesterday, no more contact. Nothing more than strangers, even if we cross paths again."



Gabriela froze. "Are you serious?"


Would this be the final verdict, or would he change his mind by evening? Maybe she should record it for proof.



His expression didn't budge. "Of course I'm serious.You should leave. No more little stunts to get my attention. We're not suited for each other. Best to go our separate ways."


Gabriela understood his words perfectly, yet a stubborn doubt lingered, making it impossible for her to truly believe him.


Her stillness, the faint shadow of hurt in her eyes,made Brenden's resolve waver for a heartbeat. But he was a man who stuck to his decisions once made.



"You need to leave now. And never come looking for me alone again. Oh, and don't give me anything,either."


Gabriela blinked, stunned all over again.


She had no intention of giving him anything.She only wanted to retrieve what was hers.



When Gabriela's lips parted to speak, Brenden cut her off with a pained look. "Why are you still standing there?"



From his tone and the weariness in his eyes, it didn't seem like an act. He truly wanted no part in any connection with her.



For now, she decided to believe him. Turning away, she returned to her room and resumed knitting the scarf.


Loretta had been urging her to finish it, though Gabriela still didn't understand why.


From behind, Brenden watched her go. Her slender back stirred an unexpected pang in him, a flicker of sentimentality he didn't care to examine.


He snapped out of it, giving himself a sharp slap.


Gabriela was a good woman, yes, but there was still a gulf between them, one that couldn't be crossed.


Meanwhile, Gabriela kept to Loretta's request,finishing the last stitches on the scarf.



Loretta's face lit up the moment the scarf was in her hands. "Gabriela, your craftsmanship is incredible.Even the expensive scarves in boutique windows can't compare."



Gabriela flushed at the praise. "Actually, it's my first time knitting. I'm really not that skilled yet."Turning away, she returned to her room and resumed knitting the scarf.

Gabriela flushed at the praise. "Actually, it's my first time knitting. I'm really not that skilled yet." "It's already wonderful," Miriam chimed in, then added casually, "Gabriela, would you mind giving this one to Mrs. Larson?"



Gabriela smiled. "Of course not."



Aside from Farley, Loretta and Miriam were the people closest to her.


Even if Loretta asked for ten scarves, she'd knit every last one.



No sooner had Loretta taken the scarf than she shooed Gabriela toward her room. "You've had a long day. Get some rest in your room."


The swiftness of her dismissal made Gabriela pause.But what could Loretta possibly be scheming against an ordinary, unpaid cook like her?



Choosing not to press, Gabriela returned to her room.





The moment she was out of sight, Loretta snatched up the scarf  and hurried off to find Wesley. All afternoon, Wesley's mind had been elsewhere,his attention slipping despite the book in his hands.


When the door opened to reveal Loretta, a faint flicker of disappointment crossed his eyes, so fleeting he didn't notice it himself.


What exactly had he been expecting?


Loretta stepped inside without preamble, holding the neatly folded scarf.


Wesley's fingers stilled mid-turn of a page. After a pause, he closed the book and asked with deliberate casualness, "What's this?"


"It's from Gabriela," Loretta said, lowering her voice as if sharing a secret. "She made it herself. Knitted it stitch by stitch. Then she came to me and practically begged me to make sure it reached you."


The corners of Wesley's mouth lifted, almost imperceptibly.


So, she'd gone to the trouble of knitting a scarf for him. He fought back the grin threatening to give him away,settling instead for a lazy sneer. "Then why didn't she give it to me herself?"


"She's probably too shy," Loretta replied. "Not everyone shares your indifference to romance-while you've never had a girlfriend, your cousin's exes outnumber fingers on both hands." Her glare could have cut glass. "Well? Are you taking it or not?"


Wesley had half a mind to roll his eyes straight into the back of his head.



The scarf seemed just an excuse. Loretta's real mission was clearly to lecture him.


With a resigned sigh, Wesley reached out. "Alright,fine.I'Il take it."


Loretta's eyes narrowed, her tone sharp. "You should wear it today. And, I'm warning you. Don't you dare pull that bored, disdainful face of yours."


That caught him off guard.

 
What on earth had Gabriela done to win Loretta over so completely?


He gave a defeated nod. "Alright, alright. I'll play along."


Loretta pressed the scarf into his hand.


It was wonderfully made, warm, soft, and somehow disarming.


Wesley lowered his gaze to the white yarn, each stitch neat and deliberate, not a single hint of haste or carelessness.


It happened to be a shade he liked very much.


And in that quiet moment, he knew he wasn't just anyone in Gabriela's heart-he was the one.

###Chapter88 Maybe She Truly Had Fallen For Him
Loretta studied Wesley's impassive face,uncertainty curling in her chest.


Did he like the scarf Gabriela had knitted?



"Here, have this scarf," she urged, pressing it towvard him. "Later, put it on and walk past Gabriela.Let her see it. Make her believe you're fond of it. Don't upset her,alright?"


Wesley inclined his head, answering flatly, "Alright."


Was he really expected to wear it immediately,parading it just to prove something to Gabriela?


If she cared for him deeply, why had she acted like a stranger before? She had even nitpicked his long legs, as if that small complaint could disguise her true feelings.

What a sly woman.


The instant Loretta came out of the study, Miriam,who'd been lingering nearby, quickly approached."Well? How did it go?"


"He accepted it, but he didn't look the least bit excited," Loretta muttered with a crease in her brow."Honestly, what's wrong with him? Gabriela gives him something so meaningful, and he can't even bother to smile."



With every word that left her lips, her irritation only deepened. "Such a ridiculously good-looking man,yet he still can't find himself a girlfriend!"


Miriam leaned close, her voice soft and steady."Don't let it get under your skin. Let's test Gabriela's feelings first."



If Gabriela truly harbored feelings for Wesley, then whether his heart stirred or not didn't matter.


Their carefully crafted plan would have to unfold tonight.  With their minds set, Loretta and Miriam headed off to find Gabriela.



At that very moment, Gabriela was chatting on the phone with Farley. "I'll come to see you in a few days.And don't forget-I need another taste of those pork chops of yours."


A sharp knock sounded at the door. Gabriela hurried to end the call and rose to answer.


Loretta and Miriam slipped into the room, quietly shutting the door behind them. They scanned the hallway to ensure no one lurked nearby. Their secretive expressions sent a prickle of unease down Gabriela's spine.


"What's going on?" she queried, her voice tight.


Loretta caught Gabriela's hand, her face clouded with distress. "Do you remember what I told you about Wesley-"


Gabriela cut her short, her tone cool and measured,"Don't circle around it. Just say what you mean." When it came to Wesley's tangled affairs, she wanted no part of them.


Now that she had money in her own account, all she wanted was to savor a life free of messy entanglements.


As a result, she needed to steer clear of the wealthy family's drama altogether.


"Just be honest with me." Loretta pressed with quiet insistence. "Has Wesley truly treated you well?"


"Of course," Gabriela responded right away.


He might treat her with cool detachment at times,teasing her for being clumsy, yet whenever she was cornered and defenseless, he unfailingly stepped in-her silent shield, her unshakable anchor. With him at her back, she found the strength to push against anyone who tried to wound her.



A boss of his kind had truly been one of a kind in the whole world.



Loretta drew closer, her tone probing. "And what about Miriam and me? Are we good to you as well?"


"Of course you are!" Gabriela said with a gentle smile.



"Then I'd like to ask a favor. Would you be willing to help me with something?"


Her first instinct was to nod, buut Loretta's grave expression pulled her up short. Gabriela narrowed her eyes slightly. "What kind of favor?"


"The scarf you gave me earlier-Wesley seemed to take a liking to it, so l passed it on to him. Could you say you knitted it especially/for him?"


Gabriela blinked in confusion. "Why would I do that?"


Turning her face aside, Loretta squeezed out a few tears. "You know Wesley's past thirty now, and he still hasn't brought home a girlfriend. The rumors outside are vicious. People whisper that he isn't into women at all. Some even spouting the ridiculous claim that he's impotent."


Beside her, Miriam was all but flapping her lashes in  warning, her frantic winks looking like they might spasm out of control. Loretta was definitely overdoing it.


Frowning in doubt, Gabriela noted, "Mr. Moss is young, accomplished, and widely respected. Even if he hasn't settled down, who would dare spread such nonsense about him?"


Loreta sighed. "He lost his parents when he was just a boy. I poured my whole heart into raising him,always hoping one day he'd build a family of his own.Now, all I ask is that he at least have a girlfriend before my time runs out."


Gabriela kept her lips pressed together. She understood Loretta's concern, but how on earth did that relate to her giving Wesley a scarf?


Loretta leaned in, her eyes sharp with intent. "If Wesley took your scarf, it shows he feels something for you. Why not step into the role of his gilfriend just to silence the rumors?"


The suggestion jolted Gabriela. "No. That's impossible." Her heart thudded at the thought.


With Brenden living under the same roof, pretending to be Wesley's girlfriend would only spark chaos.


Miriam blinked, caught off guard.


The night Wesley had brought Gabriela home, she'd seen the girl's cheeks flush pink at his presence.That wasn't nothing. Gabriela had definitely been interested.



Could it be that Wesley's disinterest in women had extinguished Gabriela's spark?


Oh no, that only proved it was time to push their final plan forward-without delay.


Miriam chimed in, "How about this? When people are around, Loretta drops a hint that you're Wesley's future wife. You don't need to confirm it-just don't deny it."


Gabriela immediately recoiled from the idea.


If Brenden caught wind of this, he might run straight sley and tell him about their one-night stand,ying her as some conniving woman.


ela didn't want to lose her job, and couldn't ch the thought of Wesley seeing her as a ating opportunist.


only been a reckless, drunken night-nothing




a, though, refused to let up. With tears ing in her eyes, she pleaded, "I'm already old,t I still have to endure others gossiping about he made a fuss, she could always find a way to things later.





nner, Gabriela caught sight of Wesley ding the stairs and went rigid where she




g black coat swayed around him, a white scarf neatly against his throat, lending him an ss air of elegance.


so devastatingly handsome!  Maybe she truly had fallen for him.


Yet she knew he could never return those feelings.


The realization pinched like a bolade behind her ribs,leaving her chest aching.


With a quiet sigh, Gabriela turned her face aside,swallowing her sorrow.


Wesley's brow tightened in irritation.


He had gone so far as to change into an outfit chosen to match that scarf, and yet Gabriela refused to spare him even a second glance.


Instead, she turned her back on him.Outrageous!


Brenden, never one to keep quiet, broke the silence with a teasing tone. "What's with the fancy getup at this hour, Wesley? And a scarf, too? I've never seen you wear one before. Where'd you even get it?"


Wesley didn't bother acknowledging him, keeping his gaze fixed straight ahead.


Loretta had already grown weary of Brenden's  chatter and decided she'd drag him out for another round of exercise after dinner.


Before he could continue, Miriam cut in brightly,"This scarf looks perfect on you, Mr. Moss. Whoever made it clearly has some skill with their hands."


Wesley flicked Gabriela a sidelong glance, his voice flat and unreadable. "Not bad."


The words pierced Gabriela harder than she expected.


She had spent two full days knitting the thing, and all she got in return was "not bad"?


Loretta had said he liked it-so why didn't it sound like it at all?


Miriam leaned forward, unwilling to let it go."Wait,isn't that the scarf Gabriela knitted? How did it end up with you?"


Wesley gave a slight nod. "She kepot insisting,leaving me no choice but to accept."

###Chapter89 Could Brenden Have A Split Personality
When Wesley finished his words, Gabriela stayed composed-but Brenden looked as if he'd just been struck,staring at her in disbelief.


He'd only told her not to contact him anymore,and she'd gone and given the scarf to his cousin.


Even if she had been rejected, shouldn't there have been a period of quiet heartbreak, of struggling to move on before starting something new?


Resentment burned in Brenden as he glared at Gabriela through the entire dinner.


Gabriela, meanwhile, felt tense.


She knew she shouldn't have agreed to Loretta's request-Brenden was clearly unhappy.


If he broadcast their one-night stand now, she could It lose her job.


She decided to placate him. "Mr. Saunders, you seem unwell. Are your legs bothering you? I know a way to ease the pain..."


Brenden scoffed coldly. "No need."


If she no longer cared for him, why pretend to be concerned?


Wesley's expression shifted as well. He glanced at Brenden's shorter legs, then at his own longer ones.


What's wrong with having long legs? Why didn't Gabriela like them?


After dinner, Gabriela wanted to clarify the scarf misunderstanding to keep Brenden from saying anything reckless.


Brenden was lurking near the artificial rock.


Before she could approach, he waved her off dramatically. "Stay back. Since you chose to give the scarf to Wesley, commit to him fully." Gabriela hurried to explain, "Mr.Saunders,you've got it wrong. It's not what you think."



Brenden's mind raced with an audacious thought.


Had Gabriela given the scarf to his cousin deliberately to spark his jealousy?


To capture his attention, she dared to provoke Wesley.How bold!


With a grave expression, Brenden said, "Gabriela,Wesley's not someone to trifle with. Keep your distance."



Gabriela was stunned.



Was he losing it? Why was he saying things she couldn't understand?



Brenden continued, "I stand by what I said. Do not approach me in private again. And don't provoke Wesley again, whatever your motives. Understood?"


His warning tone weighed heavily on Gabriela. She knew Brenden wouldn't just stand by if she got close to Wesley.


She quickly clarified, "Your grandmother asked me to deliver the scarf..."


"I don't want excuses. Leave," he insisted.


"I'll go, but can you promise not to tell Mr. MosS about us?"



Brenden's eyes widened.


She was using Wesley to make him jealous but feared Wesley finding out.


So timid, yet she'd gone to such lengths for him.How could he betray her?


He bristled. "What do you take me for? You think I'd spread gossip like that?"


With Brenden's assurance, Gabriela was eager to put distance between them.



Meanwhile, Wesley had been quietly pleased with the scarf-yet as dinner concluded, Gabriela's attention never once flickered in his direction.  His mood soured further.


Post-dinner, he skipped reading and an important gathering, choosing to change in his room.


Glancing at the scarf, his irritation grew. He grabbed his phone and messaged Gabriela. "Can't sleep.Read something to me."



Gabriela regretted not recording their earlier talk when she received the WhatsApp message from "NotASaunders."



Determined not to give in, she sent a voice message."You jerk! Get one of your friends to read to you.l warn you, if you harass me again, you'll regret it."


Unsatisfied, she resolved to confront Brenden in person.


At that moment, Brenden was being pulled by Loretta for more exercise.



His legs trembled, and using a bathroom break as an excuse,he rushed to Wesley for help. He hoped Wesley could intervene. Continuing like this would leave him exhausted.



"Wesley, save me!" Brenden burst into Wesley's room without knocking, as was his habit.


He overheard a voice message on Wesley's phone."You jerk!"



Wesley didn't seem offended. In fact, he looked almost pleased.



Who was this woman daring to scold Wesley? The voice sounded familiar.



But that wasn't the point. Brenden realized that Wesley really enjoyed being scolded. But only by women,perhaps.



"Why didn't you knock?" Wesley asked, frowning.


Under that cold gaze, Brenden's back straightened.He blurted an apology and hurried out to process this new information.



Wesley rubbed his temple and locked the door. Brenden's manners were atrocious-perhaps he needed not just a trainer, but an etiquette tutor.


When Gabriela came looking for Brenden, she found his door wide open. He sat on the bed, muttering to himself.


She couldn't make out every word, but caught fragments. "I was wrong... Only by women..."


A chill crept over her.


Was Brenden a completely different person at night?


Could he have a split personality? Or was there some mental disorder at play?


Why did he seem like one person in the daylight and someone entirely different once night fell?


She slowly backed away, holding her breath, and returned to her room.



How terrifying!


The Moss family was full of secrets; and she'd only been here a few days. If they realized how much she knew, would they silence her?


The thought sent another shiver down her spine as she looked again at the reading request.


She shouldn't provoke someone who might have two personalities.


Picking up her phone, she sent a new voice message in a softer tone. "Mr. Saunders, I wasn't in a good mood earlier. My tone was harsh. I'm sorry. Which book would you like me to read?"


Wesley listened to the deliberately sweetened voice and let out a cold laugh.


He typed out a line from the book, instructing her to find that exact edition. "But every once in a while,you find someone who's iridescent, and when you do,nothing will ever compare."


Gabriela paused.


It was from a book she had once loved, but had lost and nearly forgotten. "I don't have that book with me,"she typed.


His reply came fast, sharper than before. "If you don't have it, find a way to get it. Apex Group hired you to solve problems, not make excuses."


Gabriela was stunned.



Why was Brenden suddenly angry?


And besides, it was Wesley who paid her salary, not him. Being his cousin didn't make him special.


She was willing to challenge anyone-except Brenden, whose mind she wasn't sure about.


Finding the book online, she started reading to him.


Her voice was bright with a touch of sweetness,pleasant to hear.


Yet Wesley took no enjoyment from it.


Why was she surrendering to his demands so effortlessly? Did no one ever teach her she was allowed to say no? Worse still, after all this time, she still hadn't remembered anything about him.


Her memory had more holes than the scarf she'd knitted!
###Chapter90 His First Encounter With Gabriela
Wesley ended the voice call, reached for a bottle of wine, and poured a modest half-glass before stepping onto the balcony.


His heart condition kept alcohol to a rare indulgence,limited to the occasional sip of red wine.


Gently swirling the crimson liquid, he leaned against the railing, gazing up at the velvet night sky.


A luminous moon glowed overhead, reminiscent of the one that had illuminated his first encounter with Gabriela four years prior.


Those had been the darkest days of his life.


Gravely ill, with doctors issuing a grim prognosis, his usually carefree cousin Brenden had wailed as if the heavens were collapsing. fled,leaving behind a book.


After that, she vanished, and he never saw her again.


Four years later, she had come back into his life.


There was no need to hurry-after all, they had a lifetime ahead.


Wesley set down his wine glass, retrieved the book,and opened it on the coffee table.


He snapped a photo and shared it online.


On Gabriela's end, the call had cut off abruptly. She fired off a message. "Mr. Saunders, do I no longer need to read the book to you?"


No response came.


Suddenly, she noticed "NotASaunders" had posted a WhatsApp status update.


She'd never seen him post before and had even suspected he'd blocked her from his feed.


Curiosity piqued, she opened it and saw a photo. On a balcony sat a small table, holding half a glass of red wine and a book.


Gabriela's lips curved into a pout.


Brenden, usually a playboy, revealed an unexpectedly romantic side under the night's veil.


Her eyes sharpened suddenly.


The book on the table looked familiar.


Zooming in, she confirmed it was the same book she'd been reading moments earlier.


It was open to a page with a wavy blue underline highlighting the exact line that "NotASaunders" had sent her earlier.


"But every once in a while, you find someone who's iridescent, and when you do, nothing will ever compare."


Gabriela magnified the image further and spotted her name scrawled beside the highlighted line.

 
Was this her book? The handwriting wasn't hers. What was Brenden playing at?


She scruinized the photo again. The balcony felt oddly familiar, but she couldn't pinpoint why.


After minutes of racking her brain, she gave up and messaged "NotASaunders" again. "Should I keep reading?"


Still, no reply came.


Just as Wesley posted the photo, a knock sounded at the door.


Loretta stood there, holding a bowl of soup.


"Wesley, you've looked exhausted lately. I made this for you and Brenden to boost your strength. Drink it,"she urged.


Wesley sighed. "I was just about to turn in,Grandma."


Since his previous serious illness, Loretta had taken to crafting all manner of peculiar tonics for him.


He appreciated her care but inwardly recoiled at the thought of consuming them.


Loretta fixed him with a stern glare. "No excuses.Drink it. Brenden's already finished his. Don't make me repeat myself."


Resigned, Wesley took the bowl and swallowed its contents in one go, wincing at the bitter taste.


Only when the bowl was empty did Loretta depart,satisfied.



The concoction left a warmth spreading through him.


Remembering how he'd cut off Gabriela's call,Wesley checked his phone and saw two unread messages.


Had she grown addicted to reading to him?


His gaze cooled. He finished his wine and poured another.


After three glasses, the heat of the alcohol spread through him, making his entire body feel extremely warm. He switched off the heater and leaned back on the sofa.


The moment he closed his eyes, the memory of that night surged back-Gabriela beneath him, soft and obedient, letting him take his fill.


Those intimate images replaying in his mind made him feel increasingly restless. He suddenly rose and headed for the bathroom. Even after a shower, the heat wouldn't fade. A dull ache pulsed at his temples,and drowsiness crept in.


He hadn't felt like this in years, not since he began taking meticulous care of his health.


Ten minutes passed, and instead of fading,the discomfort worsened.


Wesley got dressed and decided he needed to see a doctor.


Outside his bedroom, Loretta and MAiriam spoke in low voices.


"I just hope Wesley's body can take it," Loretta murmured, concern flickering in her eyes.


Miriam replied, "Don't worry."


When she decided the timing was right, she nudged Loretta toward the next step of their plan.


Loretta glanced at the dishes and the bowl of soup she was holding. "We've used this trick before.Will it still work?"


"Trust me," Miriam said confidently.


Just as their conversation ended, Brenden appeared,face flushed.


He tugged at his collar, fanning himself. "What did you give me earlier, Loretta? I feel hot all over."


"What exactly is wrong?" Loretta asked quickly.


Brenden hesitated, embarrassed. "Just... warm.Everywhere."


"That's a good thing! It's a normaI reaction after having that tonic soup." Loretta shot him a glare. "If you're not going to practice your exercises, then stay in your room and behave."


Thinking back to the day's training, Brenden's knees went weak.


Well, his muscles still ached from practice-he wasn't going anywhere.


Defeated, he returned to his room.







Meanwhile, Gabriela emerged from her shower and noticed "NotASaunders" still hadn't replied.


Unbothered, she grabbed her hair dryer, ready to go to bed after drying her hair.


Suddenly, a loud crash sounded from outside.


She quickly opened her door to look.


Her room was right next to Wesley's, and as she stepped out, she saw him standing in his doorway.


His hair was still damp, yet he was neatly dressed in a white shirt and black trousers, a suit jacket draped over his arm-looking ready to go out.


His expression was hard, his irritation plain.


Loretta stood beside him, her expression equally displeased.


Gabriela frowned as her gaze landed on the shattered plates scattered across the floor in Wesley's room.


What now?



Gabriela instantly regretted stepping outside, not wanting to get involved in their argument.


She was about to retreat when Loretta spotted her."Gabriela,come here."


Remembering how Loretta had recently coaxed her into sharing a room with Wesley, Gabriela felt reluctant to approach her.


As she tried to think of an excuse, Loretta came over and lowered her voice. "I just brought some food to Wesley, but l accidentally dropped the plates."Gabriela thought it was hardly worth fussing over.


Loretta went on, "Wesley is upset with me. Could you please help clean it up?"


Gabriela nodded. "No problem."


Loretta patted her hand. "Sorry to trouble you.I'll give you a gift tomorrow."


If things went according to plan tonight, Loretta intended to give her far more than a gift-perhaps even Wesley himself.


Gabriela stepped into Wesley's room and began gathering the broken pieces.


Her eyes wandered toward the small balcony table.


She hesitated, then stepped closer. A half-full glass of red wine and an open book sat there.


Gabriela froze.



It was no wonder the balcony in the photo shared by "NotASaunders" had looked familiar-it was Wesley's balcony. Could it be that "NotASaunders" was Wesley all along?
###Chapter91 Locked In The Same Room

Gabriela's mind churned with restless thoughts.



She even controlled her breathing, wary that Wesley might somehow realize she had already uncovered the truth.



Wesley's voice suddenly cut through the air-cold,clipped,and distant. "Grandma, don't lock the door. I'm not going in."



Gabriela froze,her chaotic thoughts gradually settling into a tense stillness.



Yet,for reasons she couldn't quite name, a faint sting of discomfort lingered in her chest.



Wesley's treatment of her was needlessly harsh, his disdain barely concealed.



And it wasn't as if Loretta's actions were malicious;everything she did was for his sake. Why, then, did he respond with such biting indifference?



If he carried himself with more maturity, like someone truly ready to build a life with a partner, perhaps Loretta wouldn't feel compelled to worry and fuss over him every single day.



Swallowing her frustration, Gabriela forced herself to gather the shattered porcelain, each piece cold and jagged against her fingers, eager to retreat to her room once she was done.



But Miriam stopped her with a gentle touch, saying "Gabriela, Mrs. Larson made some nourishing soup tonight.Come downstairs and have a bowl."



Still distracted, Gabriela followed Miriam down the staircase,her mind moving through a fog



Once they had left, Loretta placed her hands firmly on her hips and launched into a scolding aimed at Wesley.



Her reprimand went on for a solid three minutes before Wesley's expression soured.



A wave of discomfort swept through him.



He couldn't decide if it was the lingering effect of the soup or the wine he had drunk earlier, but heat pulsed through his body, leaving him restless.


He had already changed clothes, intending to slip out to see a private doctor quietly.



Initially, he had hoped to avoid attracting attention-planning to leave and return without anyone noticing.But Loretta had insisted on preparing a midnight snack  and personally delivering it to his room. The unnecessary commotion killed his mood for the doctor's visit.



What he wanted now was simply the quiet relief of a bed.



Resigned, he admitted fault, offering enough contrition for Loretta to ease her lecture-though she remained firm about one condition: he could not return to the master bedroom.



"There may still be some shards in your room, so you can't sleep there tonight. Go stay with your cousin for the night."



"Impossible!" Wesley's voice carried sharp finality. His mild obsession with cleanliness made the idea unbearable-especially since Brenden snored like a saw through wood.



Loretta countered, "Then sleep in the next room."



Without waiting for his reply, she guided him into another room.



Wesley settled onto the soft bed,inhaling the subtle aroma of scented candles. Something about it felt oddly out of place.



Yet,since Loretta hadn't insisted on him sharing a room with Gabriela, he reluctantly decided to make do with  this room for just one night.


Perhaps Loretta had truly broken those plates by accident.



Maybe he really had been overthinking the whole matter.



At that moment, Wesley's thoughts lacked their usual sharpness.Weariness overtook him, and he eventually collapsed onto the bed, closing his eyes until sleep claimed him.



Meanwhile, Gabriela returned to her room after finishing the soup in the dining room with Miriam.



Her mind felt clouded, as if wrapped in fog, and she longed for quiet to sort through the link between Wesley and "NotASaunders."



When she made her way upstairs, Loretta blocked her from returning to her own bedroom, offering an odd explanation. "Gabriela, tonight you need to stay away from Wesley's bedroom, now that he is in a sour mood.Please sleep in another room."



Without questioning Loretta's strange reasoning,Gabriela headed straight to the room she'd been assigned.


Inside, she left the light off, sitting alone in the darkness while scrolling through her old chats with "NotASaunders."



Their conversations weren't many.


From the start, "NotASaunders" had known about her one-night stand with Brenden.



Maybe it was Brenden who had told Wesley about it



Perhaps Wesley had added her on WhatsApp purely for his own amusement, tossing out outrageous and absurd requests just to tease her.



The more Gabriela thought about the situation, the more her anger flared.



She had only stumbled into the wrong room once,and that had been while drunk. She had never wanted to have sex with Brenden. Did Wesley really need to tease her like this?



Gabriela's frustration boiled over.



Seething, she flopped onto the bed, flailing her arms and legs in exasperation.



Then,a strange sensation swept over her.



The air carried a faint trace of alcohol,mingled with the undeniable presence of another person.



Someone was in the room. Her pulse spiked. She snapped on the bedside lamp and turned her head-only to find Wesley lying on the other side of the bed.



Her stomach dropped. Instinct screamed at her to run.



What if Wesley believed she had deliberately entered his room?



She bolted toward the door-only to freeze when she heard him groan softly, the sound heavy with discomfort.



Loretta had mentioned that Wesley hadn't been feeling well in recent days.



Gabriela hesitated.



Even though she was still furious at him for playing the role of "NotASaunders," he had been kind to her.



He had even secured her future with a generous advance-ten years' worth of salary-giving her the confidence to stand her ground against Phyllis and Marie.



To her, Wesley was far more than just an employer who signed her paycheck.



Just then, Wesley shifted again, a low, pained groan escaping his lips. Gabriela bit her lip, her concern slowly overtaking her simmering anger. She stepped closer and asked softly "Mr.Moss, are you okay?"



There was no reply.



She climbed onto the bed and gave him a careful push
"Mr. Moss, are you feeling unwell?"



Even through the thin fabric of his white shirt,she felt an intense heat radiating from him.



Alarm prickled through her, and she quickly reached out to touch his forehead.



It was burning.



A fever?



Yet his condition didn't match the usual signs.



Could it be...



Her mind flashed to the picture of the wine glass, the faint aroma of alcohoI still lingering in the air, and she drew her conclusion-Wesley was drunk.



The possibility left her at a loss for words.



She hadn't even been here for a week, and already she had discovered just how peculiar this family could be. Loretta clung to strangely old-fashioned beliefs,Brenden might have a split personality,and Wesley-well, he was not interested in women.


And yet, despite knowing he had a heart condition,he still chose to get drunk at night



The wealthy truly seemed to have a reckless love for danger.



With a resigned sigh, Gabriela decided to fetch a towel to cool him down.



Before doing that, she tried the door, but-just as she expected-it was locked from the outside.


Another sigh escaped her. She would have to tell Loretta, plainly and directly, that Wesley's disinterest in women wasn't something she could fix.



Even if they were locked in together for ten days,it wouldn't make a difference.



Settling beside Wesley, she pulled out her phone and began recording. "Mr. Moss, you're drunk right now,and the door's locked, so I can't leave. I'm only here to take care of you, not because I snuck in."



Once she had her video evidence, Gabriela set to work, gently wiping Wesley's face. His brow stayed tightly furrowed.


He was in clear discomfort, his body burning with heat


Then, the soft press of the warm towel against his forehead seemed to ease him, like a calming balm reaching his very core.



Suddenly, his hand shot up, gripping the slender wrist that held the towel.



His eyes opened-dark, deep, and more intense than the night beyond the window-glimmering with a dangerous edge.


Gabriela froze. "Mr. Moss, you're awake. I didn't sneak in..."



Fresh from her shower, the faint fragrance of her skin and hair drifted into Wesley's senses, breaking his Last shred of restraint.


In one swift motion, he rolled over, pinning her beneath him, his grip on her hand unyielding.


Her fingers, still caught in his grasp, brushed against the cold metal of his belt buckle as he moved.



Gabriela was utterly stunned.
###Chapter92 Gabriela, Do You Like Me
Gabriela was dressed in a plain, modest nightgown,not a hint of impropriety in sight.



Yet her eyes gleamed brightly, and her lips curved with an effortless perfection.



In that moment, no man could have resisted her allure.



Wesley's voice came low and husky. "Help me undo it





Her hand was still pinned against the cold belt buckle.Stunned,she could barely think, her mind fogged as her gaze fixed on the design engraved into the metal.



Then came a faint click.



They had undone the buckle.


Gabriela's mind went completely blank."W-What are you doing?" she stammered.



Wesley braced himself with his hands on either side of her,lowering his face toward hers.



A strong wave of his scent enveloped her, making her hold her breath in alarm.



The heat of his chest, the steady beat of his heart, the strength in his arms-her thoughts blurred, as if her memories had been tossed into a whirlpool.


Why did he feel so unnervingly familiar-like the man who had slept with her for just one night?



But...wasn't he supposed to be uninterested in women?



Her fingers clutched the fabric of his shirt tightly at his waist, gripping as if to anchor herself.



She felt afraid.



Then, just as suddenly, Wesley slumped to the side,pressing the back of his hand to his eyes. A faint red hue rimmed them.



He wanted her-but he couldn't allow himself to act on it.



Gabriela seized the moment to scramble off the bed,putting as much space between them as she could.



His voice came rough and strained, heavy with restraint. "Get out!" Gabriela was frustrated.



There was no chance anything would happen between them since he wasn't interested in women. But now,he seemed to misinterpret the situation,believing she had entered his room on purpose.



And the thought of losing her job terrified her.



In a small voice, she explained, "The door was locked from the outside, so I couldn't get out now. Your grandmother was the one who let me in."



Wesley exhaled inwNardly,realization dawning.



Even before thnose dishes had been broken, this room had been setup.



The whole thing had been premeditated.



He couldn't bring himself to be angry with Loretta or Miriam, but their schemes had certainly unsettled Gabriela.



When Wesley said nothing, Gabriela hurriedly pulled up the video she had recorded earlier.



"I only realized someone was here after I came in.Please,take a look..."



She held out her phone to him.



As she leaned closer, that subtle fragrance of hers drifted between them again. Wesley felt the heat inside him spike.



It had taken all of his self-control to keep his passion in check and let her go.



Now,here she was, closing the distance.


Did she really not see him as a man at all?



Frustration twisted through him. His hand shot out,gripping hers with such force it nearly crushed her bones.



The memory of their once-shared passion surged back. His restraint crumbled-all he wanted was to claim her again.



Gabriela was entirely focused on explaining the situation to him and never expected his sudden shift in mood. She tried to pull her hand away, but his grip was immovable.



"Mr. Moss, please don't be upset. I'll call your grandmother now to have her come unlock the door."



Her voice was soft, almost pleading, and his heart yielded despite himself.



He slowly loosened his grip.



He knew that there was little chance the call would connect. And, sure enough, the moment the call to Loretta went through, it was cut off. The connection was dead when Gabriela tried again.



A hollow feeling settled in her chest.



She was still furious at Wesley for impersonating Brenden just to tease her, yet Loretta's schemes had muddled the entire situation.



She didn't know what Loretta had done this time, and now the door was closed and Wesley was actíng strangely.



But then-something felt off.



Gabriela became acutely aware that she,too,didn't feel quite right.


A slow warmth was spreading through her body.



Wesley's sharp gaze caught her change immediately,and his thoughts darted to the soup Miriam had insisted she drink earlier.



He asked in a soft tone, "Gabriela, do you like me?"



If they both harbored feelings for each other, there would be no reason to keep holding back.



Gabriela, who had been struggling to suppress the growing discomfort in her body, felt a sudden chill creep over her at Wesley's question



Was he testing her again?



She shook her head quickly, almost instinctively. "No,I don't!"



The truth was, although her heart now raced every time she saw Wesley, she never allowed herself to indulge in unrealistic fantasies.



Her firm denial brought a wave of frustration to Wesley's chest. His handsome features hardened.


She claimed she didn't like him, yet she had slipped into the hospital to see him.



She had fretted over his health every single day, and cooked for him without fail.



What exactly did she take him for?



Wesley extended his hand with cool indifference."Give me your phone."



The atmosphere in the room seemed to grow heavier in an instant. Gabriela stayed silent and obediently placed the phone in his palm.



Wesley called his private doctor, Melvin Reed,instructing him to come over immediately. "I truly apologize for the late-hour request, but I really need your help."


Though Wesley's tone was polite, Melvin knew better than to delay. He arrived at the estate in less than half an hour.



When Loretta saw him step inside, a flicker of alarm crossed her face, and she hurried to unlock the door for Wesley and Gabriela.



Wesley's expression was as cold as winter frost, and Gabriela looked uncomfortable.



Everyone shifted into the living room.



After a brief examination, Melvin said, "The tonic soup,along with the wine he consumed, caused him some discomfort. But it's not serious. I'll prescribe something for Mr. Moss and Miss Haynes. Once they take it and get a good night's sleep, they should be fine by morning."



No one spoke, except Gabriela, who, true to her polite nature, thanked him softly.



From Melvin's perspective, Gabriela seemed to have been dragged into this unwillingly. Wesley's expression was downright frightening. Who could say whether he might send her away from the estate tomorrow?



Inside, Melvin was filled with numerous thoughts, yet he maintained his composure on the surface.



He handed over the prescription, advising them both to drink plenty of water, then left quickly.



Wesley instructed Gabriela to take the medicine first,then said, "You may return to the bedroom."



Just as she turned to leave, his voice cut through the air. "Your own room."


The icy tone made Gabriela shiver. She gave a quick reply and hurried upstairs.



In the living room, Loretta and Miriam sat watching Wesley take his medication, both realizing they were in trouble.



Despite their age, they now looked like children caught in mischief, heads bowed, hardly daring to breathe.



Wesley's anger eased slightly.



He spoke in a firm, measured voice."Miriam,Grandma,I asked you not to interfere in my private affairs, but you didn't listen. You really frightened Gabriela tonight."



He remembered especially the moment earlier when his belt buckle had been undone-her face had turned pale in an instant, as if she saw him as nothing more  than a monster.



Rubbing his temples, Wesley fought to keep his composure.


It was partly his fault-his self-control hadn't been strong enough.


Loretta quickly lifted her head, worry in her voice."What should we do then?"



"Nothing," Wesley said evenly, straightening his collar."She might go home tomorrow."


She had been so shaken that it would hardly be surprising if she chose to leave.
###Chapter93 He Refused To Give Her A Gift
"No way!" Loretta and Miriam blurted it out together.



Gabriela wasn't just a good catch. She was the one they'd both been quietly guarding like treasure. Letting her walk away? Unthinkable.



"You really think a little 'no' is going to stop her?She's my employee,not my property. Where she goes is not up to me," Wesley replied, voice as flat and cold as a sheet of glass.



A flicker of panic crossed Loretta's face. "You're her boss! Find a way to keep her here."



"I'm just her boss, nothing else," he said, the words clipped,sharp.


For the first time, his irritation simmered beneath the surface.



The sheer decisiveness in Gabriela's rejection was maddening.



"Then give her a raise!" Loretta blurted, eyes sparking as inspiration struck. "Not just a little bump, five times her usual pay!" 
Wesley let out a sharp, derisive snort.



Why would he do that? To Gabriela, he was nothing more than the man who signed her paycheck.Quintupling her salary would only cement that cold,professional distance.


"No," he said, voice hard as stone.



Loretta's stomach sank.



Their schemes had spectacularly backfired-rather than drawing Wesley closer to Gabriela, they'd practically sent her running for the hills.


Loretta's glare slid toward Miriam, whose eyes were narrowed in thought.



Then, all at once, Miriam lit up. "Loretta! Fake an illness. Gabriela's got a soft heart, and she won't leave you if she thinks you need care."



Loretta nodded in approval. Perhaps, that could work.



Across from them, Wesley's jaw tightened, his face darkening with barely contained fury.



"That's enough from the both of you! No more ridiculous schemes, and don't scare her again," he said,massaging his temple as though their antics physically pained him. If Loretta and Miriam could just rein themselves in,everything else would fall into place.



Now that she was his secretary, each day brought another opportunity for them to spend more time together, and he felt confident he could win her over.



Gabriela was heading upstairs, ready to retreat to her room, when she caught sight of Brenden stepping out of Wesley's.



His hair was disheveled, and there was a strange flicker in his eyes.



"What was all that racket downstairs? Who dropped by?"he asked.



"Dr. Reed," she replied automatically, then hesitated,brow furrowing. "Why were you in Mr. Moss's room?"


Brenden was familiar with that name. Melvin would make regular visits to check on Wesley.



He was feeling uncomfortable, and his patience was running thin, even for Gabriela. "It's my cousin's room.I come and go when I want. Do I need your permission now?"



Gabriela stayed silent, unwilling to push. Then her gaze drifted down to the bottle of red wine dangling from his left hand, and the hardcover book clasped in his right.


"Were you drinking in Mr. Moss's room?" she asked,perplexed.



Wasn't Wesley a notorious neat freak? Why would he allow Brenden into his room?



"What do you care what I was doing in his roomn?"Brenden's voice was sharper now, his restlessness spiking under Gabriela's steady gaze. The heat still coursed through him, prickling under his skin. He took two brisk steps back, eyes narrowing. "You're just a secretary.Stick to your lane."



So what if she had a crush on him? That didn't give her the right to poke her nose into his business.



Gabriela nodded.



After all, Brenden and Wesley were clearly close, and as Wesley's secretary, it wasn't her place to interfere.


Piece by piece, the puzzle fit together."NotASaunders" had to be Brenden after all.



So,she'd had it all wrong.


A hot flush of embarrassment creptup her neck.



How could she have been so thoughtless? Someone as rigid and maddeningly arrogant as Wesley  pretending to be Brenden? Impossible.


She fled to her room, shut the door tight, and collapsed onto the bed. "Sleep," she ordered herself."Just sleep."


But the silence pressed in. The moment she killed the lights, she could almost hear Wesley's deep, husky murmur grazing her ear, warm and intimate, curling under her skin like a secret. "Help me unbutton..."



She had helped him unbutton his belt, hadn't she?


Yet, he'd still tossed her off the bed without the slightest mercy.


The more Gabriela replayed it, themore her frustration simmered. She kicked off the covers and sat up.



Wesley was truly uninterested in women.



Somehow, she felt an inexplicable sense of dismay about that.


She grabbed her water glass and drained it, but her throat still felt parched.


Sleep was a lost cause. She padded over to the full-length mnirror, studying her reflection.


She wasn't plain. Actually, far from it. Her figure was decent, her face more than passable. And yet,when their bodies pressed together, Wesley hadn't shown so much as an inkling of desire for her.



Infuriating.



But then, the instant his striking features flashed in her mind, her irritation faded into a hollow ache.



He was tall,impossibly handsome, wealthy, and carried himself with an elegance that could slice the air. Of course he wouldn't look twice at her.



Gabriela let out a bitter laugh.



Back in college, she had only dated Dustin, a despicable man who cheated on her.



Then she entered the workforce and quickly fell for her boss-the unforgivable workplace taboo. And Wesley wasn't interested in women at all.


She'd even once convinced herself he was pretending to be Brenden.



The shame was unbearable. She couldn't face him again, especially after all this. Tomorrow, she'd make her farewells and disappear from this whole mess.



The next morning, Gabriela stepped into the living room and froze. The space, normally serene and echoing with quiet, was bustling with people. Even the chef, who had already left for the holidays, had returned.



For a house this size, a large staff was expected,but Wesley liked things calm.



Usually, the servants kept to the far wings, well out of his way.



Seeing them all gathered together, she realized for the first time just how many people it took to run the estate.



It didn't take long to piece it together that Wesley was handing out the New Year's gifts.


Every year, the tradition was the same: the staff got their presents early, so they could go home and celebrate properly.


Gabriela's planned farewell caught in her throat.



She had helped wrap these very boxes, each packed with something extravagant.



And,well...it would be a shame to leave without one So,she sidled into the line of servants, aiming to walk away with her own generous parting gift.



As the minutes passed, she listened to the young servants, their cheeks pink, their voices pitched high with excitement. "Mr. Moss is just as generous as he is handsome!"



"I know! Usually Miriam's the one who hands them out.

I can't believe he's doing it himself this year."



"I'm keeping that gift forever."



Gabriela couldn't help but sigh. Poor things.



They could moon over him all they wanted, but Wesley wouldn't even give them a second glance.



He moved through the line briskly, each gift handed off with practiced efficiency. Then, at last, it was Gabriela's turn.



A sidelong glance, and then, without a word, the box slid right past her hands and into the next person's waiting arms. It was as if she were invisible to him.



Soon enough, the last box was handed over.


Gabriela blinked in disbelief. "Don't I get a one, Mr.Moss?"



The expectant glint in her eyes made Wesley's mouth twitch,half in irritation,half in reluctant amusement.



After everything that had gone down last night, she still had the gall to stand in line with a composed expression as if nothing had occurred. His answer was merciless. "The gifts are prepared for the household staff. And technically..." His gaze lingered on her just long enough to sting. "You're just a temp. Not an official employee."



The warmth drained from Gabriela's expression, her smile freezing in place.



Wesley, of course, enjoyed every second of it-watching her seethe behind a composed mask,knowing she couldn't lash out.



Leaning in just enough to make sure she caught the words, he added, his tone all stern authority with a spark of mischief underneath, "Which means-you get nothing."
###Chapter94 Her Wishes For Him

Gabriela stood on the brink of losing her temper.


Her voice rose with sharp insistence. "Mr. Moss, I'm a full-time employee of Apex Group!" Her eyes flicked toward Brenden, her frustration boiling over. "Even Mr.Saunders received a gift!"



Why was she the only one being excluded?



Brenden, pulled unwillingly into the quarrel while merely sitting there, straightened at once and replied with practiced calm, "Oh please, Gabriela-he's my cousin.Why would it be strange for him to give me a gift?"



As he spoke, he gave her a deliberate blink, a silent warning not to press further.


In Brenden's view, Gabriela truly did not know her place.How dare she show such disrespect to Wesley?



He resolved that he would have a serious talk with her later.



Wesley,however,found the scene oddly entertaining.
   
 The night before, she had been meek as a frightened kitten, yet now she suddenly felt bold enough to outright demand a gift from him.



Deciding to toy with her, Wesley leaned back,his lips curving. "Gabriela, say something nice and I might consider giving you a gift too."



Gabriela hesitated.



Her gaze dropped to the floor, then drifted back to Wesley-the elegant, wealthy man burdened with heart troubles.



A flicker of sympathy stirred in her chest.


After a thoughtful pause, she spoke with plain sincerity. "Mr. Moss, I hope that in the year ahead,and in every year to come, only good things find their way to you, and that misfortune stays far away. May everything unfold exactly as you wish."



Wesley's fingers froze mid-motion.



Gabriela's eyes held such unguarded honesty that he could not doubt she meant every word.


He retrieved a gift box and handed it to her.


"The same wishes for you," he murmured softly.



Gabriela accepted her gift with unguarded delight, her expression almost childlike.



It had been rare for her to receive a gift since she was eight years old.



Even when Josh bothered to buy presents, Phyllis always found a way to snatch them away.



But ever since joining Apex Group, everything had changed-she received thoughtful gifts, and, most importantly, she now had a seven-figure bank account to her name.



To her, Wesley was more than just a boss. He was the miracle who had turned her life around.



She vowed to stay by his side for as long as she could.



The thought of going home had completely vanished the moment she received a gift from Wesley.



One by one, the servants slowly drifted out of the grand manor.



Gabriela's phone suddenly rang-it was Josh,calling her back home for the family's New Year's Eve dinner.



He murmured, "Gabriela, Marie and Phyllis have realized their mistakes. I will have them apologize to you."



Gabriela had no desire to return. No matter how hard Josh tried, she refused outright.



Phyllis's name still burned across every trending list.Fearing that anyone might recognize her if she stepped outside, she barricaded herself indoors.



Gabriela sneered. Now they wanted her to come back home-who knew what kind of trap they might be setting for her?



When her husband's persuasion failed,Marie abruptly seized the phone. A forced smile stretched across her lips as she cooed with syrupy sweetness, "Gabriela,Phyllis was wrong before. Young people can be impulsive at times, can't they? She has been reflecting these past few days and wishes to apologize to you in person."



"And then?" Gabriela's reply was blunt, her tone sharp."Secretly take a video and post it online to create the illusion of reconciliation? Aunt Marie, that won't do Phyllis any good. At most, it will only make me appear generous and forgiving."



Marie's expression froze, the smile faltering before her voice turned cold. "You think that with Mr. Moss backing you, you can throw your weight around? I'm your family. When I tell you to return, you must do as I say! Because of your actions, Phyllis is living in fear behind locked doors. What more do you want from us?" Gabriela's words cut like glass. "I refuse to recognize a shameless thief as family. You stole what was mine and squandered it on your gambling addiction."



Marie's face darkened at the jab. Fury flared, and she spat, "You little bastard. Don't think you are untouchable.Since you refuse to settle this peacefully,then be prepared for what's coming."


With a sharp snap, Gabriela hung up. She had no intention of enduring Marie's senseless scolding.



Marie, blinded by rage, seemed to lose all reason.Right in front of Josh, she hurled the word "bastard"at Gabriela.



Josh froze in shock before snapping, "Marie, how could you say that to Gabriela?"



Marie sneered with disdain. "Calling her a bastard was generous. If not for her, we wouldn't be in this mess."



Gabriela's revelation of their scandals had left scars.Because of her, not only was Phyllis dragged through the mud online, but even the company's business had taken a hit.



Several clients canceled projects right before the holiday,leaving Marie with painful losses.


All of it, she believed, was the fault of that wretched  girl, Gabriela.


By now, Marie had completely lost her composure,unbothered to hide her disdain for Gabriela in front of her husband.



Josh was struck by a surge of anger. He stammered "you" repeatedly, unable to form a complete sentence.



When he remembered the trusting gaze of his sister before her death, guilt twisted through him-and he raised his hand and struck Marie across the face.



"Don't you dare insult Gabriela like that. She is my niece! Everything we enjoy now was left behind by my sister."



The slap landed with such force that blood appeared at the corner of Marie's mouth.



Phyllis stood frozen in shock.



Her father,who had always bent to her mother's will and obeyed without protest, had just hit her mother -for Gabriela's sake!



"Dad, you've gone too far!" Furious, Phyllis glared at Josh before rushing to help Marie back to her room.


Mother and daughter locked themselves away and did not emerge again for the rest of the day,leaving Josh  alone in the vast hall, hollow and lost.



He felt the weight of guilt pressing down on him-toward his sister, toward Gabriela. Yet he also knew violence against his wife was inexcusable. A man should never raise his hand against his wife.


The villa fell into a heavy silence, the cold of resentment hanging in the air.



But over at Moss Manor, warmth and joy thrived.Gabriela joined Loretta and Miriam in the kitchen,rolling out pastry dough for savory hand pies and simmering spiced cider.


She noticed Loretta preparing an unusual version-chicken pot pies filled with celery.



Meanwhile, Miriam entered with a plump pumpkin in her arms, announcing she was making a hearty pumpkin stew.


When Gabriela glanced at the ingredients, she spotted artichokes, chanterelle mushrooms, and smoked ham.



She asked curiously, "Mrs. Larson, who are the celery pies for?"



She knew well that Wesley never touched celery.



"We have a guest arriving later. She loves these."Loretta's tone softened, her eyes warm with tenderness. "After dinner, I'll pack all the celery pies for her totake home and enjoy."



Gabriela's interest was piqued.



She had been living at the estate for some time but had never met anyone from the Moss family apart from Brenden.



Who could this guest possibly be?



Around five in the evening, a quiet, young woman arrived.



She looked to be no more than twenty, delicate and sweet in appearance.



She was blind and used a white cane to guide her way.

###Chapter95 Wesley Owes His Life To Myah's Brother
Gabriela was surprised.


The young woman turned out to be blind.



"Myah, so glad you're here," Loretta said warmly,her face brightening as she hurried over to steady Myah Espinoza by the arm. "I made your favorite hand pie.I hope you enjoy it!"



"I appreciate it, Mrs. Larson," Myah murmured, her tone quiet and unsure. After that brief response, she lapsed into silence.



Loretta and Miriam rushed to place gifts in Myah's hands, holding on as if afraid to let go. Their voices brimmed with worry as they asked after her,their pity clear when they noticed how much weight she'd lost.



They fussed over her with the tenderness of doting grandmothers.



For once, Brenden set aside his usual playful manner and greeted her earnestly. "Long time no see, Myah."



Wesley stepped forward with an unexpectedly gentle air, his tone low and careful. "Delia mentioned that you were sick a few days ago. Are you feeling any better now?"



The maid trailing behind, Delia Pope, quíckly answered,"Miss Espinoza has recovered now. Please don't worry sir. I'll make sure to take good care of her from here on."



Myah's brows pinched faintly, the formal tone clearly unsettling her.


Yet the moment Wesley's presence drew near, her tension eased, and she breathed out softly, "Wesley."



He reached out with an easy smile, ruffling her hair in a gentle pat. "Now that Myah's here, let's sit down to eat."



Gabriela,watching from the side,was struck-she had never witnessed Wesley treat anyone with such warmth. The sight only sharpened her cuiosity about Myah.



Still, she reminded herself that she was merely his secretary; prying into his private matters would be reckless.



Myah suddenly turned toward Gabriela, her voice barely above a whisper."Mrs. Larson, are there other guests in the house today?"



The question startled Gabriela. She hadn't uttered a word,yet Myah had somehow sensed her presence despite being unabole to see.



Gabriela quickly responded, "Nice to meet you, Miss Espinoza. I'm Gabriela-Mr. Moss's secretary. During the New Year, I've been lending a hand in the kitchen."



Her explanation came out longer than necessary, as if she worried Myah might misinterpret her presence,which drew a faint crease across Wesley's brow.



When Myah heard her name, her hand faltered, and the color drained slightly from her cheeks.



Her voice sharpened with urgency. "Gabriela? You're from the Haynes family?"



Gabriela blinked. "Yes, that's me."



Myah pressed, her tone tinged with agitation."Don't you know who I am? It's me-Myah."


Wesley stiffened at once, his eyes flicking toward Gabriela.



The rest of the room exchanged puzzled looks.



Gabriela's mind went blank, her voice faltering. "I'm sorry, I don't recall ever meeting you. You must be confusing me with someone else."



At her denial, Myah's expression crumpled. She  lowered her head for several seconds before slowly lifting her face again. "My apologies. I thought your voice sounded familiar, but I must have been mistaken.After so many years, it's possible her voice has changed."



The faint disappointment in her expression stirred a trace of sympathy in Gabriela, who quickly offered reassurance. "It's alright."



Myah lapsed into silence again.



Miriam emerged from the kitchen carrying the dishes,her voice brisk as she called everyone to the table.


During the meal, the household's attention remained largely fixed on Myah. She, however, spoke sparingly,maintaining a polite reserve throughout.



When she finally tasted the pumpkin stew,her lips curved faintly. "This stew is wonderful. Mrs. Larson,your cooking seems to get better every year."



Loretta laughed warmly. "Actually, Gabriela prepared it this time. Her touch outshines mine these days."



Myah paused, taken aback. "Gabriela made this?"



Gabriela offered a gentle smie. "Mm-hmm. If you enjoyed it, come by more often andI'll make it again for you." "Thanks, Gabriela," Myah murmured, her voice barely above a whisper, before retreating back into silence.



Once the meal ended, she rose almost at once,insisting she had to be going



Loretta coaxed gently, "Myah, why don't you spend the New Year here at the estate? Your room's already waiting for you."



Myah gave a small shake of her head, her voice quiet but firm. "I appreciate it, but I feel more at ease on my own."



Knowing the weight Myah carried inside,Loretta didn't argue further.



Instead,she carefully packed some food and passed it to Delia, repeating her instructions to watch over Myah with extra care.



Myah reassured Loretta, "Even without Delia, I'm capable of looking after myself. You don't have to keep treating me like I'm helpless."



Loretta, however, couldn't shake her concern. She hovered beside her, walking her to the car.



After Myah settled into the seat, Loretta's face clouded with sadness. She sighed over and over,whispering, "That poor girl..." Wesley also seemed downcast. Once dinner ended, he withdrew straight into the study and stayed there.



Gabriela, meanwhile, found herself intrigued by Myah.



The moment Myah heard her name, she had appeared thrilled.



And yet, Gabriela knew in her heart she had never seen Myah before.



She kept her curiosity tightly reined in, refraining from prying for more information about Myah.


After dinner, she wandered the garden paths, letting the crisp night air and the scent of pine ease the heaviness of her meal, before retreating to her room to rest.



The estate carried a subdued air-no one seemed inclined to stay up and welcome the New Year.


She considered calling Aubrey on video. Her thoughts were interrupted when Miriam slipped inside.



"Gabriela, didn't it stir even a little curiosity in you,seeing Myah here today?" Miriam asked, watching her closely, aware of the feelings Gabriela harbored for Wesley.



Most women might have felt a twinge of jealousy seeing another young woman arrive at the estate and receive such affection from Wesley. Gabriela,however,stayed perfectly composed.


Gabriela gave her head a small shake, signaling she had no interest in gossip.


Even though Gabriela claimed not to be curious,Miriam still worried she might get the wrong idea about Wesley and Myah. Wanting to clear the air, she offered a brief explanation. "Wesley owes his life to Myah's brother."


Her words trailed off into silence, her expression clouded with a wistful melancholy, as if some sad memory had surfaced.



That hint of sorrow drew Gabriela in, and she asked gently, "And what happened to Myah's brother? Why wasn't he here for dinner?"



"He's gone," Miriam answered with a weary sigh, her voice weighted with sorrow. "Such a good boy-but his life ended far too young, barely past twenty.Poor Myah... she and her brother only had each other,and when he passed, she was left utterly alone."



Before his death, Myah's brother had asked Wesley to take care of her.



Wesley had tried to bring Myah into the estate,but no matter how many times he persuaded her, she refused. So he bought her a house in another neighborhood and arranged for several maids to care for her.


Miriam fell silent after that, carefully avoiding any mention of how Myah's brother had died, as if the subject itself carried a shadow no one dared disturb.



Gabriela sensed it wasn't something she should pry into-every family,especially one this powerful, had its share of secrets.



Sometimes ignorance was the safest shield.



When Miriam finally spoke again, she gave Gabriela's hand a gentle pat, her tone quiet but earnest."Mr.Moss is in low spirits today. If you can spare a little time,would you sit with him for a while?"



Gabriela gave a quick nod. "Alright."



Only after agreeing did it dawn on her-what business did a secretary like her have trying to lift his spirits?



Still, since Miriam had asked, Gabriela rose from her seat, warmed a cup of milk, and carried it carefully toward Wesley's study.


The door lingered ajar, the silence behind it heavy.


Inside, Brenden sat with his head bowed like a schoolboy caught in trouble.
As Gabriela approached, Wesley's sharp voice cut through the silence, laced with irritation. "Touch my things without permission again, and you'll regret it."
###Chapter96 Reading To Wesley
Brenden mumbled in irritation, "It's just one book.You've got shelves full of them-why get so worked up?"


Wesley didn't bother replying. He turned each page with deliberate care, checking for damage before closing the cover with a slow, deliberate motion.


His eyes lifted, sharp as ice when they landed on Brenden. "From now on, stay out of my bedroom unless I say otherwise. No drinking in there, no touching my things."


"Fine," Brenden said, still baffled. "You never used to be this strict. Guess the older you get, the fussier you become."



Wesley's gaze hardened to steel as he retorted,"Want to say that again?"



Brenden instantly recognized the danger in his tone and clamped his mouth shut.


Gabriela lingered at the doorway, catching fragments of the exchange. She couldn't piece together exactly what had happened, but it was obvious Wesley was ripping Brenden to shreds.



The door stood partly open, and Wesley had already spotted her. She froze, caught between the urge to slip away and the impulse to knock.



Wesley wrapped up his tirade at Brenden, then flicked a glance at the door and said in a cool, measured voice, "Come in."



Gabriela stepped inside quickly, carrying a glass of milk, the tension in the study prickling against her skin


In that moment, she wished she hadn't agreed to Miriam's request.



Choosing her words tenderly, she told him, "Mr. Moss,you barely touched dinner. I thought you might like a glass of warm milk."



Wesley's expression softened, the edge in his eyes easing as a faint smile tugged at his lips. "Just set it down here."



The moment Gabriela tried to make her quiet exit,having set the milk down, Wesley's voice froze her in her tracks. "Hold on, Gabriela. There's something l want you to take care of."



Brenden wasted no time slipping out, seizing the escape while he could. He believed Gabriela hadn't come to the study just for Wesley's sake-her errand had been the perfect excuse to steal a few last glances at him.


Yet he had to scurry off and leave her behind. Facing Wesley head-on was enough to rattle anyone.



"Sorry, Gabriela," Brenden muttered as he fled, guilt etched across his face.



Left standing by the desk, Gabriela rested her hands stiffly at her sides, waiting for Wesley to speak. When the silence stretched unbearably,she broke it in a low voice. "Mr. Moss, what would you like me to do?"



Wesley finally lifted his head from the book he'd been leafing through, his dark gaze locking with hers.


For a moment, his eyes glimmered with a depth that felt both unreadable and oddly tender.



Everything about him looked immaculate, and from where she stood, he seemed almost dangerously handsome.



Her chest fluttered, her cheeks flushed crimson, and her heart betrayed her with a sharp, unsteady skip.



Catching her flustered expression, Wesley's mouth curved, and he let out a low chuckle as he extended the book toward her. "Read to me." Her fingers brushed the cover as she accepted it, a jolt of recognition running through her.



Wasn't this the very same book that "NotASaunders"shared in his post?



Did that mean both Wesley and Brenden shared the same strange fondness-being read to from this particular book?



While Gabriela tried to steady herself, Wesley never looked away. His gaze lingered on her face, examining every flicker of emotion.



Although Gabriela felt uneasy, she hid it behind a facade of composure.



The corners of his brows tightened.



She knew this book-he was certain of it. Then why was she feigning ignorance?


The book's weight pressed into Gabriela's palms, its presence oddly familiar.



Perhaps it was because she had once owned the same book.



When she flipped open the cover, her eyes landed on a name scribbled in the lower corner-Allan. She found herself wondering who he was. She flipped to the next page, and an unexpected illustration met her gaze: a saint cloaked in light, arms outstretched as though blessing an endless crowd.



Just as her fingers reached to turn another page, a faint trail of sandalwood, cool and sharp like winter air,signaled Wesley's approach.



The atmosphere shifted instantly, her thoughts scattering like startled birds in flight.



"Start from here." His hand closed gently over hers,guiding the book open to a marked passage.



Gabriela lowered her gaze to the lines he had indicated for her to read.



"Some of us get dipped in flat, some in satin,some in gloss. But every once in a while, you find someone who's iridescent, and when you do, nothing will ever compare."



Gabriela's pulse surged, their close proximity sending an uncontrollable rush through her.


She drew back a step, throat tight, then forced herself to steady her voice and begin reading aloud.



Wesley reclined in his black chair, listening in slence,his expression shadowed with thought. The dim corner seemed to swallow him, his presence merging almost seamlessly with the night.


Gabriela noticed the heaviness in his demeanor and realized he truly wasn't in good spirits today.


That brief sense of sympathy quickly vanished as her throat grew raw, each word scraping against the strain of two relentless days of reading and singing.



Two hours slipped by until her voice finally broke with quiet insistence. "Mr. Moss, it's already very late.Maybe you should try to rest."



Wesley shifted his gaze toward her, the depths of his eyes holding quiet displeasure, carrying the weight of disappointment that pressed heavier than his silence.


Gabriela was frustrated. Wesley's stern expression left no doubt about his displeasure.



He reminded her of "NotASaunders" on WhatsApp-always issuing demands, never once content with what she offered.



Catching her reluctance, Wesley's sharp look softened,and he dismissed her gently. "You may go."



She slipped from the study as though fleeing an unseen pressure. The manor lay in heavy silence. The stillness pressed down until sleep felt impossible.



Her thoughts circled endlessly around the blind girl,Myah.


Her mind refused to quiet, pinning her awake beneath the weight of the night.



When morning came,it was New Year's Day.



With the servants gone on holiday, the vast manor seemed even more hollow and deserted.



Gabriela realized that since Myah had shown up,the entire mood in the manor had grown heavy. Even Brenden, usually so irrepressibly carefree, carrieda rare weight in his expression.



The first day of the new year slipped by in uneasy silence. They exchanged a few polite greetings, but the lively celebration Gabriela had pictured never arrived.



On the second day, a summons from their grandfather compelled Wesley and Brenden to return home for a family dinner.



Gabriela decided she would spend the day visiting Farley instead. Wesley arranged for a driver to take her.


When she reached Farley's home, she was welcomed by the sight of a table overflowing with snacks.


"Happy New Year, Farley!" she greeted warmly



"Happy New Year to you too, Gabriela!"


Farley passed her a neatly wrapped gift, his face glowing with childlike joy.



He hadn't looked this cheerful in years, humming tunelessly as he bustled around the kitchen.



Once the food was ready, the two settled at the narrow dining table, sitting across from each other.


Although his dishes weren't exactly refined, Gabriela felt warmed by the simple comfort of his cooking.



He might not have been related by blood, but he was always kind to her-much kinder than Josh had ever been.



"Farley, Marie has agreed to move out after the holidays," she told him softly.


His head bobbed in approval, eyes crinkling with happiness.



Gabriela went on, her tone steady but full of resolve, "My next step is to slowly take back my mother's company."



Back then, without wealth or influence, she had been forced to tolerate Marie's endless schemes. Now, with three million in savings tucked away, the landscape looked entirely different-she finally had leverage.


She learned that Marie's assistant was both a gambler and a notorious womanizer.



A man with such weaknesses could be steered easily enough.



Still, the inner workings of the Haynes Group weren't something Gabriela fully grasped yet. For that, she would need Farley's guidance.



Hearing her plan, Farley's whole demeanor shifted.Determination flickered in his eyes as he leaned forward. "Miss Haynes, just tell me what you need."


She bent closer, lowering her voice as she outlined her ideas. With each word, Farley's admiration grew.


Gabriela might look gentle and uncomplicated on the surface, but when she set her mind to something,she carried the same sharp edge and brilliance her mother once had.
###Chapter97 Murder Attempt
After finalizing their next move, Gabriela enjoyed a hearty meal with Farley. Then she carried a deck chair into the courtyard, letting herself sink into its gentle embrace beneath the radiant sun.



The sunlight poured over her like liquid gold, warming her skin and brightening the quiet corners of the garden.



Two young olive trees stood sentinel nearby, their branches bowed under the weight of delicate blossoms,filling the air with a heady, sweet fragrance.


Gabriela's gaze lingered on the trees, distant and unfocused, as if she were elsewhere entirely.


Gone was the usual spark of playful innocence in her expression; in its place, her eyes were shadowed,carrying the faintest trace of lingering resentment.


Farley observed her quietly from the side, a soft sigh escaping him.



There had always been a hidden chamber within Gabriela's heart, a shadowed enclave that no light could penetrate. Since the events of four years ago, she had closed herself off from everyone.


Gabriela remained there, still and solitary, until the sun began its slow descent toward the horizon.



Farley strolled over, cradling a jug of homemade wine,his face bright with a mischievous grin. "Gabriela, you have to try my latest batch."



Her gaze,previously fixed on the olive trees, softened immediately, and she was that sweet, familiar Gabriela once more.


She smiled, "Okay, I will take a sip."


Alcohol always had its peculiar effect on her. While she could usually hold her own, some drinks demanded no more than a single taste to send her reeling, leading to foolish antics she never remembered afterward.



The memory of her last tipsy episode in Wesley's office still haunted her.



Yet the wine's rich, intoxicating aroma called to her irresistibly. She found herself unable to resist.



"Relax," Farley said, pouring the amber liquid into two delicate glasses. "The alcohol isn't very strong. A couple of sips and you'll be fine." Gabriela, aware that she needed to return to Wesley's place later, drank with restraint-just two glasses.



As dusk painted the sky in dusky shades, she bid Farley farewell and made her way down the narrow alley,her steps lighter with thoughts of a hopeful future.


She didn't notice the crimson Maserati parked silently along the alley's edge.



In the backseat, a young woman with long, dark purple hair leaned back, her oversized sunglasses hiding most of her face. The tight line of her mouth spoke of cold intent.



"Are you sure it's her?" sheasked.


The driver, equally masked by sunglasses, gave a curt nod. "Yes. It's her."



A cruel smile twisted the woman's lips. "Hit her. Now."



The driver hesitated, voice low. "Isn't this a bit extreme?"



"What's there to fear?" she snapped. "My brother will take care of the fallout."



A weary sigh escaped the driver. "Shouldn't we check with him-"



"I'm telling you! Go!" she barked, before he could even finish.



Sensing there was no arguing, the driver slammed the accelerator. The red car lunged forward like a predator, aimed at Gabriela.



Instinctively,Gabriela leapt aside,her heart hammering,but the car clipped her, sending her sprawling to the edge of the road.



Pain flared in her elbow as the vehicle roared past,leaving only a fleeting glimpse of a long-haired woman's silhouette in the backseat.



Crouched on the roadside, Gabriela pressed her hand to her throbbing elbow, her mind racing as the red blur disappeared into the distance. Despite her thick coat, Gabriela's elbow throbbed, each movement sending sharp jolts of pain up her arm



"Crazy! Who drives in a busy neighborhood like that?"she complained.



The car had vanished too quickly for her to catch the license plate or the occupants' faces, otherwise she would have reported them.



"Are you alright?"



A gentle voice cut through the air, accompanied by a hand extended to help her up. For reasons she couldn't explain, Gabriela recoiled,avoiding the hand and rising on her own. "I'm fine.Thanks."



She looked up to see a young man standing there, his expression calm, almost casual.


"Looks like that elbow took a hit," he said softly. "Do you need to go to the hospital?"


Gabriela shook her head. "No need. It's nothing serious."



With a polite nod, she thanked him and walked away,quickly booking a car through her phone, which arrived within a few minutes.



The young man didn't follow or press further. He simply watched her retreat, a faint smile tugging at his lips as he murmured to himself, "Do I really look like a thug or something?"


Gabriela couldn't hear him as she was already slipping into the car.



When she returned, only Miriam was left behind, quiet in the vast, empty house.



Wesley and Brenden were away at a family dinner,and Loretta had gone back to the countryside. Gabriela slipped into her room with a first aid kit,carefully dabbing ointment onto her bruised elbow.



The sting made her wince, but it was nothing compared to the questions swirling in her mind. She turned the incident over again and again, yet no clear answer surfaced. Aside from Phyllis, she couldn't think of any woman who held such hatred toward her.



And the woman in the car didn't resemble Vivian at all.



Could it have been nothing more than some spoiled rich girl tearing through the streets, reckless and thoughtless?



That would be far too convenient.



Gabriela picked up her phone and called Tyler.Transferring money to his account, she asked him to pull strings and see if surveillance footage could be recovered from that stretch of road.



Tyler readily agreed but refused the money.



"Please take it, Tyler," Gabriela said. "I'll need your help again in the future."



Only then did he relent.



In fact, his bar had been struggling, and he was strapped for cash. "Don't worry, Gabriela," he said firmly. "I'll have someone look into this."



The enemy of his friend was his enemy as well



There was a dangerous edge beneath his promise, as though he was prepared to go further than she had asked.



"Thanks, Tyler."



After hanging up, Gabriela stared at Wesley's number in her contact list. Her thumb hovered over it for a long moment, but in the end, she let the screen go dark without making the call.



Though Wesley had told her she could turn to him whenever trouble found her, Gabriela knew how busy he was. For something so small, she preferred to bear it alone.



Meanwhile, Wesley and Brenden arrived at their grandfather's residence.



The house stood in the eastern district,its modest facade blending almost too perfectly with the neighboring rows of homes. Only the two stony-faced bodyguards stationed at the entrance betrayed its importance, their presence lending a gravity that the house itself did not boast. Inside, it was alive with voices. The entire Moss family had gathered to celebrate the New Year.



In the living room, a dozen younger relatives clustered together, their laughter and chatter filling the air, until Wesley and Brenden stepped in.


A hush fell almost instantly, respect laced with unease.



Wesley's quiet dominance seemed to press upon the room, stirring a tangle of emotions in the hearts of the younger generation: envy at his brilliance,jealousy of his standing, fear of his authority and the burning ambition to one day rise above him.


Before long, the servants arrived with coffee, setting the cups down with practiced grace.


The first to speak was Davion Moss, one of Wesley's cousins. His eyes flicked toward Billy standing behind Wesley, and a crooked smirk tugged at his lips."Wesley, since when do you bring your assistant to family gatherings? Careful, people might mistake this for a business meeting."



Wesley offered no reply.


Billy, for his part, stood tall and composed, as though he hadn't heard a word.



The silence cut deeper than any retort. Davion's smirk faltered, his expression darkening with humiliation.


He quickly pivoted, his gaze landing on Brenden."Ah,and Brenden's here too? Wesley, it's one thing to drag an assistant into the old house, but why a Saunders?"



Brenden's smile froze mid-curve.



Though his father was a Moss, his parents' divorce had left him carrying his mother's surname. The word "outsider" followed him every time he crossed this threshold.



Yet Wesley never treated him as such. To Wesley,Brenden's blood was Moss through and through.


Still, other members of the Moss family were unfriendly toward him, viewing him as a threat to their share of the fammily inheritance.
###Chapter98 Brenden Isn't An Outsider
Wesley's face hardened as he cast a sharp glance at Davion and declared, "Though Brenden is a Saunders,he isn't an outsider. He's my cousin."



His words showed his support for Brenden.



Davion didn't dare challenge Wesley outright, but noticing Brenden's silence, he pressed further. "I heard you were shipped off to Afluena, Brenden. What did you do to mess up?"


Howard Moss, unafraid of Brenden though wary of Wesley, chimed in quickly, "Brenden's quite the playboy,probably too busy chasing women to care about work. No wonder Wesley, who doesn't tolerate incompetence,sent him packing in frustration."



A young woman from a distant branch of the Moss family snickered, adding, "I heard that place is grimy.Brenden must have endured a lot there."



After a few more taunts, Davion turned to Wesley, his voice laced with mockery. "Wesley, Brenden has never been good for anything. Only you would waste time on a leech like him."

 Their blatant ridicule, coupled with subtle attempts to drive a wedge between Brenden and Wesley, struck the former hard.



Though he was usually thick-skinned, the cruel words cut deeply.



Aware of his own shortcomings, he stayed quiet, not wanting to burden Wesley further.


Most of the younger Moss family members were present, and seeing Brenden bow his head only made them look down on him all the more, as if he were nothing more than a pitiful fool.



Just then,Brenden's father,Graham Moss,approached.



He merely frowned at the harsh taunts. To him,Brenden was a source of shame, and he made no effort to defend him.



Brenden looked at him, a flicker of hope in his eyes,as if he wanted to speak.



But Graham's glare was filled with contempt. "You're a disgrace. Get out of my sight!"


Brenden's eyes reddened, his hands balling into fists.


The sting of his father's disgust cut far deeper than any other wound.Wesley,who had remained silent, stepped forward in a few swift strides, positioning himself protectively in front of Brenden and fixing Davion with a chilling stare."To me, Brenden is worth more than you will ever be."



Davion's smug grin faltered



Wesley continued, "Brenden is diligent and competent. He wasn't sent to Afluena for any failure.My company started a new project there, and he was chosen to lead the well-digging team." His icy gaze swept the room. "He's more capable than any of you here."



Though Wesley's tone was even, his look made everyone feel like they were being seen as trash.


Their faces darkened, but no one dared retort.



Wesley's authority within the family was unquestioned;even if he insulted them outright, they would stay silent.



Brenden swelled with pride at Wesley's public praise.His tears vanished, and he stood taller.



"I'm so thankful to Wesley for sending me to Afluena.The ground there is tough as rock,but I still managed to dig a well!" Brenden's face glowed with newfound confidence as he added, "And going to Afluena helped me grow. There's even a great girl who's secretly in  love with me."



Nearby, Alden Moss's mouth twitched at Brenden's smugness.



How could someone as useless as Brenden still have Wesley's backing? The thought sparked envy.


Unaware of the brewing resentment, Brenden continued boasting about Gabriela's devotion,oblivious to Wesley's expression darkening like an approaching storm.



Billy watched Brenden with a mix of pity and exasperation.



This foolish man. If he didn't stop, Wesley might assign him another grueling project.


As Brenden rambled, he suddenly noticed Wesley had stepped aside, which touched him deeply.



Wesley had not only defended him but also given him the stage to shine. Wesley was truly kind to him, and Brenden silently promised to repay him someday.



Lost in his own world of newfound confidence,Brenden didn't notice their grandfather, Roger Moss,approaching with several younger family members.



Seeing everyone gathered, Roger signaled for the family banquet to start. As they sat around the table, dish after dish arrived.


Roger, seated at the head of the table, scanned the room before speaking. "Wesley, after the New Year,there's a shareholders' meeting. Clear your schedule to attend it at the Moss Group headquarters."


His invitation was a clear acknowledgment of Wesley's competence.



Was he about to name Wesley as his successor? Or was the Crownridge Group being handed to hím?


The family members' faces shifted subtly, though they quickly masked their reactions.



Even Davion, often at odds with Wesley, forced a smile and offered congratulations.


Wesley responded coolly, "I'll consider it. My own company keeps me occupied."


Roger, expecting the refusal, didn't push. "The position will be there for you whenever you decide to return."



That announcement cast a subtle tension over the meal,one that even Brenden could feel.


After dinner,Brenden rushed to the car, inspecting it repeatedly. Billy, curious, asked what he was doing.


With a grave expression, Brenden replied, "Grandpa clearly wants Wesley on the board. Didn't you see?Everyone looked ready to kill him. I need to check if the car has been sabotaged."



Billy realized Brenden had a point and promptly called professional bodyguards over to examine the vehicle



By the time they returned to Wesley's place, it was late.



Loretta was still away in the countryside, leaving the expansive estate quiet and empty.



Only Miriam and Gabriela were in the living room,watching TV.



The show's plot wasn't clear, but Miriam was teary-eyed,muttering,"That poor girl-her husband's awful."



Gabriela,uninterested in melodramatic romances,still comforted her patiently. "Don't worry, he'll regret it eventually."



Their voices broke the stillness.



Wesley paused at the entrance, a faint smile crossing his face.



As soon as Gabriela turned and saw Wesley,she stood  quickly and took his suit jacket as he removed it."Welcome back,Mr. Moss!"



In that moment, Wesley felt a rare warmth.



Despite the hostility and unpleasantness he had endured at the Mosses' house, coming home to her smile brought him a sense of peace.



Then his gaze sharpened. "What happened to your elbow?"



Gabriela froze.



She had been sitting with Miriam for hours, yet Miriam hadn't noticed, while Wesley picked up on it immediately.



He was remarkably observant.


"It's nothing. I tripped on the way back," she explained.



Wesley's eyes darkened, realizing she wasn't telling him the truth.



Without pressing, he rolled up his sleeves and headed to the study, Billy trailing behind.



Brenden's heart raced when he saw Gabriela.



Thanks to her, he had held his head high at the Mosses' house for the first time. Above all, he owed Wesley for giving him the well-digging project.



Suddenly, Wesley turned. "Brenden, come with me."



Brenden hurried over without hesitation.



In the study, Wesley instructed Billy, "Find out what happened to Gabriela today."



"Right away, sir," Billy replied.



"And..." Wesley paused, then waved him off. "Never mind. You can go."



He had considered pressuring Marie to return Gabriela's house sooner, but worried Gabriela would move out immediately if he did.



He wanted her to stay a bit longer.



As Billy left, Brenden asked eagerly, "What do you need me to do,Wesley?"



Wesley frowned. "You should go to bed."


"Okay. I'll go rest now," Brenden said, then added,"You're so good to me, Wesley. I truly appreciate it."


Wesley didn't bother responding.



Outside the study, Brenden hesitated, then approached Gabriela with earnest gratitude."Thank you,Gabriela."

###Chapter99 He's Gained A Few Extra Pounds
Gabriela froze, baffled, her lips parting as she was about to ask Brenden what on earth he was thanking her for.



But then she noticed the strange gleam in his eyes and the twisted curve of his expression, which reminded her of his schizophrenia. Was he hallucinating again,imagining she had done something to him?



A chill rippled through her.



Not another episode! Not again!



Who knew what bizarre request he might spring on her this time?



She forced a polite smile. "You're welcome, Mr.Saunders. It's late, and I'm really exhausted. If there's nothing else, I'll just head to my room and get some sleep."



Brenden inclined his head with unusual calm. "Good night."



He watched with growing fascination as Gabriela practically fled, disappearing down the hall. How interesting. The women before her had always leapt at the faintest hint of his attention,practically draping themselves over him.



Yet Gabriela, madly infatuated as she was, ran away the moment he opened the door for something more



He found her shyness even more intriguing.



Gabriela had braced herself for battle, convinced that "NotASaunders" would send some infuriating message to ruin her night.


But as the clock crept past midnight and her phone stayed stubbornly silent. Her tension unraveled, and sleep claimed her.


When she stirred the next morning, sunlight spilled across the room.



First thing, she checked her phone. There were no messages from "NotASaunders," but a string of texts from Aubrey popped up.



Gabriela discovered that several luxury brands-once loyal partners to Claire-had publicly announcedthe termination of their contracts.



And to top it off, the production team of a hit romance drama dropped a bombshell on Twitter: Claire, once their leading lady, had been replaced-swapped out for a fresh-faced actress with more talent, if not fame.



Aubrey followed the news with a row of laughing emojis, practically gleeful.


Gabriela typed back a crisp reply. "Serves her right."


Aubrey wasted no time delivering her theory. "Why did Claire suddenly get blacklisted? Gabriela, this might actually have something to do with you."



Gabriela blinked. "Huh? Why would I have anything to do with that?"



Aubrey's reply was swift. "Claire's been quiet lately The only thing she's posted was a couple of updates supporting Phyllis. You know exactly who's orchestrating Claire's downfall. This has your protector's signature all over it. Clearly, this has to be an act of love. But, if you still can't see that, maybe it's time you open your eyes and figure that part out."



Her protector?



Yes,Wesley treated her different from how he treated others at the company.



But it had to be something else. Maybe he enjoyed her cooking. Or perhaps it was because Loretta and Miriam favored her, leading him to extend a bit more courtesy toward her. An act of love? Absolutely not



Gabriela shook her head vigorously, as if to banish the very idea.



Loretta wouldn't throw around wild claims about her grandson not being interested in women.


And really, if Wesley had harbored any romantic feelings about her, that night would have revealed it.The atmosphere had been intimate enough, yet he had restrained himself completely.


Wesley's kindness wasn't personal. It was just who he was. He went out of his way to help her because he was a decent person. And for that,she should find some way to repay him properly in the future.



Gabriela gave herself a sharp mental warning about entertaining ridiculous ideas.



She even patted her cheeks briskly, snapping herself back to reality, before scrolling through her unread WhatsApp messages.



Aubrey wasn't the only one flooding her inbox. Phyllis had sent a barrage of messages too.



"Gabriela, everyone insults me now.Vivian won't even talk to me. You've left me with no friends. You must be thrilled!" "Don't get too cocky! I won't let this slíde!"


"Gabriela, you bitch. P'll make your life miserable!"



Phyllis's texts had spiraled, over a dozen messages brimming with curses, as if she'd completely lost her grip. Eventually, when Gabriela still hadn't replied, the tirade sputtered out.



Gabriela skimmed the rants, too disinterestedto even roll her eyes. Without bothering to retort,she simply blocked her.



Then, stretching a little, she rose and swept the curtains open, letting the daylight pour in.



Outside, a soft rain whispered against the windows,ushering in the first real breath of spring.



Loretta returned from the countryside with two oversized boxes stuffed with local specialties her relatives had pressed on her: creamy artisanal cheeses,jewel-bright jars of jam, and delicate handcrafted chocolates.



Gabriela sampled a few, and her delight was instantaneous. Eyes sparkling, smile blooming, she looked for all the world like a child set loose in a candy shop.



Loretta's heart warmed at the sight, though a pang of frustration followed close behind.



The more she liked this girl, the more it stung that Wesley was such a disappointment. How could he not appreciate such a treasure? How would he ever find someone worthy if he couldn't recognize what was right in front of him?



Her gaze slid sharply toward Wesley, her disapproval practically searing through him



He blinked back, puzzled by the silent accusation.



Meanwhile, Brenden, amused by Gabriela's joy,drawled, "Wesley, you probably won't touch any of these. Why don't you just let Gabriela take them all home?"



Gabriela looked startled.



All of it? How could she possibly finish so much on her own?



Wesley's expression hardened, his voice clipped and cold. "Gabriela, these kinds of sweets cause acne. Eat them sparingly. If you come to work with a face full of pimples, it will damage the company's image."



Gabriela bit back the urge to roll her eyes so hard they might get stuck.


She couldn't shake the suspicion that Brenden and Wesley were deliberately teaming up to tease her.


Still, as much as she adored the snacks, a girl had to think of her skin. Vanity won out over appetite, and she didn't dare take too many.



She offered a courteous smile and sidestepped the comment with ease. "Mr. Saunders, maybe you should try a few more."



Brenden's face brightened instantly. "Then how about we share them?"



Wesley's expression, by contrast,	darkened immediately.



Loretta, either oblivious or intentionally ignoring the tension, chimed in with a chirp of cheerfulness, "You two enjoy! I'll fix some honey lemon water; that will get rid of the acne worries."



Wesley's only reply was a sharp, frosty snort before he strode off toward the study.



Lately, he had been prickly, temperamental even Gabriela navigated each interaction like walking on glass, taking the farthest seat at the table just to avoid his ire.



And yet, the harder she tried to tread lightly, the more his displeasure seemed to grow. 
To her telief, her time working part-time was nearing its conclusion.


Gabriela's brief stint at the manor had quietly stretched to thirteen days



When Loretta pressed her wages into Gabriela's hands,the sudden sting of gratitude brought unexpected tears to her eyes.



She had assumed Wesley had already advanced her ten years' wages, so this time she was just cooking for free as promised, not daring to expect any payment for her part-time work.



To her surprise, Loretta handed her every last penny,and even slipped a small gift into her hand.



"Gabriela, next time you're on break, you absolutely must come back for part-time work. Honestly, having you cook for Wesley has done wonders; he's gained a few extra pounds."



Gabriela beamed. "No problem."



Loretta waved a hand toward Wesley, a teasing sparkle in her eyes. "See for yourself, Gabriela! His cheeks aren't so sharp anymore."



Wesley stiffened, a flash of irritation crossing his face. Compliments should have pleased him, so why did they sting?



Because he had always taken care of his physique. All this drivel about adding on a few pounds was just unnecessary!



Brenden grinned and nudged him. "Oh, come on,Wesley. Are you actually gaining weight? I've been eating Gabriela's food too, yet somehow, I'm still perfectly slim."



Wesley's eyes darkened, his temper shadowing the room.



Feeling the sudden chill, Brenden's knees threatened to buckle, and he bowed his head so fast it was almost comical.



Gabriela, clutching her wages, had intended to leave immediately-but Loretta had other plans.



"Wesley's got work tomorrow. You'll ride back to the company with him," she declared, almost playfully commanding.



Gabriela paused, hesitation appearing on her expression.



Wesley spoke casually, his tone even. "If you leave tonight,mny driver would have to make a special trip to drive you back. Just stay tonight and we can head to the company together tomorrow."



Not wanting to trouble his driver, Gabriela nodded.She might as well stay another night.


After dinner, she wandered into the back garden for a breath of fresh air. To her surprise, she spotted Wesley jogging under the dim glow of the garden lamps.


"Mr. Moss? Why are you running at this hour?" she asked, a note of curiosity in her voice.



He shot her a cool, detached glance. "Your cooking is too good. I've gained a few pounds, so I'm working it off."



Gabriela blinked, never imagining that excelling in the kitchen could somehow provoke dissatisfaction.


Carefully, she added, "Perhaps you shouldn't push yourself too hard. Your heart isn't in the best condition right now."


He slowed slightly, conceding, "You're right. I'll take it easier." "But jogging doesn't burn many calories, so l need to double the time. And running alone is boring Why don't you come along?"



Gabriela froze,stunned. Yet soon she found herself jogging beside him, trying to keep pace.



She couldn't quite wrap her head around how her gentle concern for his health had led to her becoming his jogging partner.
###Chapter100 Your Endurance Is Absolutely...

Wesley, despite his fragile heart, possessed unexpected endurance and jogged for nearly thirty minutes.



Though they had moved at a leisurely jog, by the time Gabriela finally stopped, fire scorched her throat, her legs quaked with violent tremors that threatened to buckle beneath her, and perspiration drenched every inch of her body.



She typically shunned physical exertion, and only in this moment did she grasp why Brenden's workout complaints always carried such genuine anguish.



Even Wesley showed signs of exertion, his dampened bangs lending him an unexpectedly rugged magnetism.



Yet he maintained that natural grace and distant composure that seemed carved from marble.



He delivered his verdict with unmistakable disdain."Your endurance is absolutely pathetic."



Gabriela nodded with desperate enthusiasm.Precisely her point-surely this meant future runs were off the table. But Wesley pressed forward, "Starting tomorrow,you'll dedicate thirty minutes daily to exercise alongside me."



Gabriela's mind reeled in disbelief.



She studied Wesley, whose commanding presence dominated the space around them.



She traced the lines of his towering, perfectly balanced frame and the defined, sinewy forearms exposed by his rolled sleeves.



Then her gaze lingered on his breathtakingly sculpted face.



For crying out loud! His body was already toned enough! Why bother exercising?



Suspicion crept through her thoughts-Wesley was orchestrating this elaborate charade purely for his own entertainment.



"Mr. Moss, work begins tomorrow morning. Between commuting and office hours, when exactly would I manage these sessions?" Gabriela retorted.



Rather than responding, Wesley turned the question back on her. "What exactly is my role in your life?"



Gabriela answered without pause, "You're my employer, naturally."


"Precisely. You joined my company to resolve challenges, not to seek answers from me," he stated.



Gabriela found herself cornered without escape. What alternative existed-brazenly continue occupying Wesley's residence? Absolutely impossible.



The arrangement might have passed scrutiny during the New Year holiday while she worked part-time,but extended cohabitation would inevitably increase the risk of someone finding out.



Such revelations would devastate the company's reputation.



Gabriela retreated to her quarters on unsteady legs and encountered Brenden ascending the staircase.



Observing her hollow expression,	Brenden experienced a wave of compassion.



She would soon depart the estate. Once separated from his presence, how could her heart not shatter completely?


True, he maintained careful distance and feigned indifference, but here she could still glimpse him occasionally, particularly during meals when they faced each other across the dining table. However,departure meant eternal separation. Brenden could already envision her weeping through endless nights.



The more vividly he imagined her suffering, the deeper his self-loathing grew



After retreating to her room, Gabriela went to the bathroom and soon emerged feeling refreshed, the strain from jogging eased.



After gathering her scattered thoughts, she felt that Wesley's order was hardly worth her concern. She even harbored hope that he might abandon the scheme by morning.



She slept peacefully and awakened revitalized the following day, though her muscles protested with stiffness.



Noticing her labored movements, Brenden couldn't resist offering, "Gabriela, after breakfast, perhaps I could drive you to the office."



Gabriela's body went rigid with alarm.


Brenden had clearly lost his mind. She would never,under any circumstances, accept his transportation.



Wesley fixed Brenden with an icy stare and observed,"You don't even report to headquarters." Brenden let out a helpless sigh.


Poor Gabriela. She faced double punishment-banishment from the estate and separation from his workplace presence.



Following breakfast,Gabriela departed for the office with Wesley.



Despite their wariness, several colleagues witnessed their arrival together.



Within hours, news had circulated throughout the entire company that Gabriela had emerged from Wesley's vehicle on her first day back.



Even Tessa's attitude toward Gabriela changed. Her manner and speech carried newfound warmth and familiarity.



During lunch break, Aubrey flooded Gabriela's phone with messages demanding to know what was going on between her and Wesley.


The moment Gabriela joined the cafeteria queue,Aubrey approached her. "Gabriela, are you dating Mr.Moss? How could you conceal something this monumental from me?"



Gabriela let out a sigh. Finding herself thrust into the spotlight felt absolutely mortifying.She gestured toward Aubrey's features, deflecting "Did you indulge excessively during the holidays?Your face appears noticeably fuller."



For any woman, such observations struck at the core of deepest insecurities. Aubrey immediately clutched her cheeks. "Is the change that pronounced?"



Gabriela confirmed with a solemn nod. "Plus there's a pimple forming right here. Too much sugary food,maybe?"



Aubrey frantically retrieved a compact mirror to locate the offending spot, completely abandoning her previous interrogation.



Having successfully diverted Aubrey's focus, Gabriela exhaled quietly with relief.


Meanwhile, Cali and her two companions had monitored every word, their anxiety mounting steadily.



Gabriela's razor-sharp restroom confrontation remained vivid in their memories. They had been navigating their work with extreme caution, terrified that even the smallest workplace transgression might trigger their dismissal.



Now it appeared Gabriela hadn't merely shared Wesley's bed; she had established residence within his personal domain. Who could predict whether Wesley's future bride might indeed be Gabriela herself?


Waves of bitter regret crashed over Cali and her friends.



Cali summoned enough courage to approach Gabriela and whispered, "Ms. Haynes, those heels must be torturous. Wouldn't you prefer to rest for a moment?I'd be delighted to fetch your lunch."



Unaware of their complicated history, Aubrey bristled with protective indignation. "What's your game here?Gabriela belongs to my circle. Are you attempting to poach my closest friend?"



Cali would never presume to claim Gabriela as a friend.Merely escaping punishment felt like divine mercy.


Gabriela observed Cali and her companions,realization dawning on her.



During that restroom confrontation, when she had directed a threat at them, she believed her fate was sealed after crossing Wesley so brutally.



She could never have imagined that events would take such a different turn.



She responded with measured composure, "Bear this in mind-disasters bloom from reckless tongues. You'd better think twice before you say anything in the future."



Cali recognized this warning as her final reprieve. She bobbed her head frantically, showering Gabriela with breathless gratitude.



Aubrey was surprised.



Cali,typically so insufferably proud, now cowered before Gabriela like a scolded child.



Yet while some colleagues, like Cali,adopted cautious humility and swift contrition, countless others burned with seething jealousy and bitter resentment.


"I suspected something when Gabriela, barely out of university, climbed the ranks so impossibly fast. Turns out she simply fucked her way to the top."


"Still, you have to admire her strategy. Mr. Moss is absolutely gorgeous. I'd be more than willing to share his bed, no strings attached."



"Me,too!"



"Oh please, get realistic. With Mr. Moss's status, do you honestly believe he'd select a bride from peasants like us? His wife must emerge from aristocratic circles, at minimum some refined socialite."



"Gabriela merely struck gold because her beauty captured his attention."



"Yeah, she's nothing but a fleeting distraction for him.Mark my words-soon enough, he'll discard her like yesterday's trash."



Such venomous observations circulated exclusively beyond Gabriela's hearing, never spoken boldly enough to reach her awareness.



Following lunch with Aubrey, Gabriela ascended to the twelfth floor.



Fiona stood positioned outside the executive office.



The instant she spotted Gabriela, memories flooded back-that previous visit when Gabriela had maliciously disabled the heating, leaving her wracked with a brutal cold.



Even Loretta had maintained careful distance since that incident.



Then Fiona discovered that Gabriela had actually resided at Moss Manor during the New Year holiday.


With accumulated grievances surging through her consciousness,Fiona fixed Gabriela with glacial hatred and intercepted her path as she emerged from the elevator.



"Did you step from Wesley's vehicle this morning?" Fiona inquired, her voice sharp as winter glass.
