###Chapter 1 Pregnancy



"Sorry, the number you're trying to reach is unavailable right now..."



The robotic voice echoed again, but Yvonne Ellis didn't hang up right away. She sat at the long dining table with her phone pressed to her ear, calling Julian Powell,her husband,over and over, hoping he would answer just once.



Looking at the message she sent this morning-"It's our third wedding anniversary. Can you come home early?"-she sighed bitterly.


Julian had left her words unread, as if the date slipped from his mind.



But for Yvonne, it wasn't a shock. His heart had belonged to another woman for years, so how could he spare a thought for their marriage?


The truth was, Julian had only agreed to marry her to keep his grandfather, Rodger Powell, from worrying about him.



In the three years since, he had built walls around himself, refusing to talk to her and never even having sex with her. The clock struck twelve, and the candlelit dinner she had worked on for hours became a cruel joke.



She let out a shaky laugh, and tears ran freely down her cheeks. Lifting her glass, she emptied the wine in one swallow.



Alcohol was never her strength, and before long, the edges of her grief blurred into a light-headed daze.



She stumbled into the bedroom and collapsed onto the bed, her unfocused gaze fixed on the chandelier's bright glare.



Just as sleep threatened to pull her under, a warm touch brushed her collarbone, and she startled awake.Blinking rapidly, she found Julian seated at the edge of the bed.



His suit jacket was gone, his white shirt sleeves rolled up to his forearms. A gleaming watch caught the light as his wrist shifted. His long lashes lowered slightly,hiding the depth of his eyes. His expression was unreadable, his handsome features calm and distant.



Yvonne froze in shock for a brief moment before quickly sitting up. A rush of uncontrollable joy swept through her, and her voice quivered with excitement as she spoke. "You're finally home. Has it been a hectic day for you? Are you hungry? I can go make something for you right now..." Yvonne lurched out of bed in a panic, terrified he might walk away again. But her foot snagged the carpet,sending her straight into Julian's solid chest.The sharp bite of alcohol mixed with his familiar cologne wrapped around her like a warning.



The realization struck her all at once. He had been drinking heavily. That was the only reason he would be here, sitting on her bed when he normally kept his distance.



Even with his calm exterior, Yvonne knew better. His stiffness gave him away. Julian despised being touched by her, and his silence carried a weight she couldn't name.



She opened her mouth to speak, to apologize for the clumsy fall, but her eyes caught something that silenced her. A glaring lipstick stain bloomed against his collar. Her chest tightened, and a sharp ache tore through her.



"What's wrong?" His voice was low, almost gentle.


Snapping back, she pulled her hands away from his shoulders as if burned. "Sorry, I didn't mean to," she whispered, her apology tumbling out.


Before she could move farther, his palm pressed firmly against the back of her neck, holding her in place. His head dipped suddenly, and his lips crushed against hers.


Her eyes flew wide. The kiss was fierce and consuming,making her forget how to breathe.



Instinct told her to resist, and she pushed at his chest.However,his hold only grew stronger.


"I want you," he mumbled, the words rough and unsteady against her lips.



His other hand slipped beneath the hem of her satin nightdress, tracing the curve of her thigh with deliberate intent, climbing higher with each slow movement.



Heat rippled through her body, rising from her waist and surging up her spine until it clouded her thoughts.Rationality dissolved, leaving her lost in the pull of his touch.



For the first time in years, the hollow place inside her felt whole. And just before desire consumed her completely, one last clear thought flickered. Julian had to be heavily drunk-there was no other reason for this.







Sunlight slipped past the curtains when Yvonne finally opened her eyes, and the quiet rush of water from the bathroom told her Julian was awake before her. A dull ache spread through her body as she pushed herself upright, the blanket sliding down and baring the faint kiss marks along her collarbone-marks that felt surreal, considering how distant he had always been.


Her gaze drifted toward the closed bathroom door,her chest stirring with a confusing mix of disbelief and fragile hope.


He had finally chosen to have sex with her, and it left her wondering if this meant he was ready to open up to her, to put effort into understanding her and building their marriage.


That thought gave her strength to rise from the bed.She bent down to gather his discarded suit jacket,and from its pocket tumbled a bracelet that sparkled in the morning light.


The piece was breathtaking. A sapphire cut into the shape of a delicate flower gleamed at its center,ringed by sharp silver facets that caught the light like shards of ice.



As Yvonne traced its design with her fingers, the bathroom door opened. Julian stepped out, steam curling around him, a towel knotted low at his hips. His tall frame revealed sculpted lines, from the sharp cut of his abs to the deep V that led downward,every inch of him radiating effortless strength. His eyes flicked toward the bracelet in her hand. "It suits you," he said, his tone light, almost careless.



Her lips parted in surprise."Are you giving thisto me?"



Julian stopped abruptly on his track, studied her hopeful expression, then gave a brief nod. "Yes."Without another word, he crossed into the dressing room.



The coldness in his voice hit like a splash of icy water,making last night's closeness feel surreal, like it was merely a dream.



Yvonne watched his retreating back, a flicker of disappointment passing through her before she quickly steadied herself. She found comfort in knowing that their relationship was beginning to shift,and she held onto the belief that Julian would one day recognize her true value.



A small smile bloomed across her face as she admired the jewel in her palm. Maybe, just maybe, he was beginning to change.



From that day onward, she noticed the smallest shifts between them-quiet, subtle steps that hinted their marriage was no longer standing still. Dinner at the villa became less of a rarity, with Julian showing up at least twice a week now. The change in routine didn't go unnoticed. At a lavish afternoon tea, the wives of businessmen eyed Yvonne's brighter mood, their voices buzzing like bees.



One leaned forward with a smirk and asked, "Yvonne,something's different about you lately. You look radiant. What's the good news?"



Yvonne's lips curved in a modest smile, ready to share her newfound happiness, when a sudden wave of nausea surged. She bent forward, gagging, her reaction silencing the chatter around the table.



The startled looks that followed all said the same thing-the symptom wasn't foreign to these married women;was she pregnant?



The thought hit Yvonne with force. She remembered her missed cycle, her pulse quickening as disbelief clouded her mind.



She excused herself quickly, unable to sit there under the weight of their stares, and rushed straight to the hospital. Hours later, a crisp white envelope heldher answer.



"Eight weeks along. Congratulations," the doctor announced warmly. "You're going to be a mother."



The words barely sank in. Yvonne pressed her hand against her flat stomach, her eyes stinging with tears she hadn't expected.


Pregnancy had never crossed her mind, yet here it was staring her in the face.



The news left her reeling, and the first thought that followed was Julian. He would never celebrate this.His cutting words from the past echoed back-having a child with her was something humiliating.


A knot formed in her stomach. If he discovered the truth, he might demand she end it.


The thrill of the moment evaporated,leaving only dread. With a heavy sigh, she thanked the doctor politely and stepped out, her heart weighed down with uncertainty.


Still, she couldn't hide it forever. Whether he liked it or not, the child belonged to both of them, and Julian would eventually know.


Her hand shook as she scrolled through her contacts,searching for Julian's name. But a voice from a nearby exam room made her stop cold.



Through the doorway, she spotted Julian inside,steadying a striking woman onto a chair. The doctor's congratulatory words rang out.


"Mr.Powell, you're going to be a father. Your wife is eight weeks pregnant..."
###Chapter 2 Being Deceived



The sight of her husband accompanying another woman for a prenatal check-up hit Yvonne like a bomb going off inside her skull, leaving her dizzy and unsteady on her feet. And the shock rattled her,making her accidentally hit the dial button.



A few seconds later, Julian's voice drifted out from the exam room. "Hello?"



Yvonne kept her gaze locked on him through the half -open door, her throat tightening until her words shook hesitantly. "Where are you right now?"


Her mind spun in chaos. The doctor called that woman Julian's wife. Then what did that make her? Eight weeks ago lined up with the night he had sex with her for the first time. So, her husband had slept with another woman during the same week?



The weight of that thought nearly tore her apart.Tears blurred her vision as she squinted at the woman's face, and recognition struck like a blade.



Rita Adams. The name screamed inside her. The very woman who had lived in Julian's heart for years.


Yvonne remembered stumbling across Rita's picture in his study once, tucked away but cherished.


Stories about them had floated around too-how they had met overseas, how their shared passions had made them inseparable, how everyone had thought they were destined to be together. If not for her marriage to Julian, they would have been the couple people envied.


Only now did Yvonne grasp the truth. Rita had returned. And Julian had taken Rita back into his life.



It dawned on her with a cruel clarity-the wife he wanted had never been her. Her eyes filled until the tears slipped free, and the realization cut deep.



Had he already been with Rita before he had slept with her? The lipstick stain on his collar came rushing back to her memory. She finally understood. That trace must have belonged to Rita.


A heavy knot twisted in Yvonne's stomach, but hope,fragile and foolish, kept her eyes fixed on Julian's back, desperate for him to come clean.


Inside the room, his gaze flickered toward Rita before he answered, his tone smooth and detached, "I'm in a meeting at the office.Why are you calling?"


The lie cut through her like ice. For a moment her thoughts scattered, leaving only the burn of betrayal and rage. A bitter smile tugged at her lips, mocking herself for ever expecting honesty


There was no point in pressing further. Any question would only humiliate her more.


She ended the call without a word. Her body gave out as she slid down the cold wall, her hand clamping over her mouth to stifle the sobs that broke free.



A nurse passing by stopped, concern etched on her face."Are you all right?"


Meanwhile, something unsettled Julian. He turned his head slightly, as though sensing eyes on him, but the hallway beyond was empty. A faint frown creased his face.



Yvonne had never once defied him.For years she had bent quietly to his will, yet this time she had hung up before he even could. The abruptness gnawed at him.



An instinct urged him to leave and search for her. He stood up abruptly.



"Julian, who was it?" Rita's voice qquivered as she tugged on his sleeve, her delicate face tilted up in practiced vulnerability.


The moment broke, and Julian steadied himself. "Just work," he said evenly.


He eased his sleeve from her grasp, turned back to the doctor, and continued in that same calm voice,asking about the dos and don'ts during a pregnancy.



After Julian turned his focus back to the doctor, Rita's gentle mask slipped. Her eyes narrowed ever so slightly as she pulled out her phone beneath the table.Fingers moving quickly, she sent a message, saying,"I just spotted Yvonne at Kumvine Hospital. Check why she's seeing an OB-GYN."



Later, at the hospital entrance, Julian walked Rita to the car, his voice calm and detached. "Go home and get some rest."



Her hand froze on the door handle, and she turned back with a wounded look. "You're not coming with me? I don't want to be alone tonight... I'm scared."


His reply was immediate, smooth, and distant. "I've got things at the office that need attention."


Rita's fingers curled tightly against her palm, but within seconds she replaced the frustration with a sweet,understanding smile.I right. I'll wait for you at home."



Julian gave a short nod, watched the car roll away,and then headed for his own vehicle.



On the drive back, he dialed Yvonne's number again and again. Each time, the call rang unanswered until finally her phone switched off. By the time he sat at his desk, the weight in his chest had settled into something cold and heavy. His phone rested in his hand, his face shadowed by a stormy scowl.



Stacks of documents sat waiting, but the ink on the pages might as well have been invisible. His mind refused to focus.



The silence broke with Andrew Pearson, Julian's friend,barging into the office, grinning ear to ear. "Julian,congratulations! You're going to be a father!"



Julian's eyes darkened further, his jaw tightening Clearly Andrew must have caught wind of his accompanying Rita for a prenatal visit and jumped to conclusions. His voice came out sharp. "Stop spouting nonsense-"



But Andrew cut him off, too excited to notice the warning edge. "You really don't know yet? Yvonne was sick at a tea party today, looked just like morning sickness. Everyone's saying she's pregnant!"
###Chapter 3 His Choice



Yvonne dragged herself through the front door, her steps heavy as if every ounce of strength had been drained from her.


Kicking off her shoes, she stood still for a moment,her eyes roaming the dark, empty house. The corners of her lips curved into a hollow smile, one that carried no warmth.



Only now did she truly see how foolish she had been.This house had always been lifeless, just like Julian's heart. She had spent years guarding a place that was actually cold, silent, and meaningless,becoming little more than an object of pity.



It didn't surprise her that he wasn't home. He had spent the day at Rita's side, celebrating her pregnancy Most likely, he was still with her now, wrapped in tender moments that belonged only to them,imagining the family they would build together.



Every day before today, Yvonne would have already cooked a full dinner, set the table, and left the lights on,waiting for him with foolish hope.


But tonight, she didn't bother. She didn't even turn on the lights as she walked barefoot into the hollow living room, her body moving on autopilot.


When she reached the sofa, an unexpected hand shot out of the shadows, pulling her against a firm chest.



Her startled cry filled the room just as a lamp flickered on, bathing Julian's face in soft, golden light. His features looked carved from stone, flawless and distant.



Pressing a finger to her lips, he whispered, "It's me."


She froze, stunned by the sudden closeness. No matter how many times she told herself to stop caring,her heart still betrayed her, fluttering at the sight of him.



Julian let her go as quickly as he had pulled her in. The fleeting warmth vanished, leaving behind the same indifference as his voice turned cold, almost reproachful. "Where have you been all day? I tried calling you over and over, but you never answered."


Reality slammed back into her chest. The question was almost laughable. Shouldn't it be her demanding to know where he had spent his day?


She wanted to scream the truth at him, but the words never left her mouth. Instead, she curved her lips into a faint, steady smile and replied, "Yeah." Yeah? What was that supposed to mean? He was about to press further, but then he caught her eyes.


Something in her calm indifference made his irritation vanish. His words came out gentler, uncertain.'you all right? You look pale... are you sick?"


Yvonne dropped her gaze to the floor, realizing that the concern she once craved from him no longer carried the same weight.



Exhaustion pressed down on her, leaving no room to play the forgiving wife. Her voice was faint, almost detached. "I'm worn out. I need to rest."


She turned toward the stairs, but before she could take more than two steps, Julian's arm wrapped around her and pulled her back sharply against him.


Her body jolted from the force, and instinctively her hands flew to shield her stomach. Anger flared hot in her chest."What do you think you're doing?" she snapped.



Julian's eyes bore into her, his brow furrowing. "You're pregnant, aren't you?"


Her breath caught.He knew? But how?


A wild question flickered through her mind-if he had discovered her pregnancy, then would he choose her or would he still cling to Rita? "I..." The admission trembled on her lips, but the sudden shrill ring of his phone sliced through the moment.



Julian picked up his phone and answered the call.A soft, tearful voice came through the receiver,trembling with pain. "Jules, I slipped in the bathroom,and my stomach hurts so badly. Can you come over?The baby..."


Julian's face hardened instantly, urgency sharpening his tone. "Don't move. I'm on my way right now."


The call ended, and without hesitation he shoved Yvonne aside, striding toward the door with long,determined steps.



Her vision blurred as tears welled, the sting cutting deep. One plea from Rita, and he could abandon her without a backward glance.



Bitterness unlike anything she had felt before clawed up her throat. For once, she wanted to force the truth out of him, to know where his loyalty lay-was it ever with her, or had it always been with Rita?



She rushed forward, fingers clutching his sleeve desperately. Her lips parted, but before she could beg him to stay, his voice snapped like a whip. "Whatever it is, save it until I get back!" Her restraint shattered. Her voice shook violently as she cried out, "Where are you going? Who was that woman? You're my husband, Julian. How can you..."


The words she wanted to hurl at him caught in her throat. In that instant, it struck her-maybe she had been wrong all along.



Two months of routine dinners and fleeting gestures had tricked her into believing in something that was never real. She had let herself dream of a marriage that only existed in her imagination, forgetting that Julian had never once offered his heart.



Their marriage had always been a transaction,nothing more than a carefully staged illusion.



Julian's hand moved with a cold precision as he pried her fingers away from his sleeve. His eyes, sharp and merciless,pinned her down like a blade. "Yvonne, stop deceiving yourself. I told you from the start-I don't love you. Whatever I do is none of your concern."



Her heart hollowed at the cruelty in his tone. Her chest tightened painfully at his bluntness. She loosened her hold, a broken sob slipping past her lips as she whispered, "I'm sorry... I went too far..."


Julian lingered only long enough to cast her a silent,cutting look. Without another word, he turned and walked out, the door slamming behind him with finality.


The echo of that sound told her everything-whatever fragile tie had existed between them had just snapped.


Julian's chilling stare refused to leave her thoughts,replaying like a cruel reminder she couldn't escape.


Her stomach twisted, and she stumbled toward the bathroom, hand pressed over her mouth until she collapsed in front of the toilet.


Nothing but water spilled out-she had eaten almost nothing all day, yet her body convulsed as though punishing her further.


The spasms wracked her frame, and tears blurred her vision. With trembling fingers, she rested her palm against her flat belly, a broken laugh escaping through the pain. "Little one, you couldn't have chosen a worse moment to arrive. I'm the only person in this world who wants you."
###Chapter 4 Pretense



Julian never returned that night,leaving Yvonne sitting on the bathroom floor with her back pressed to the cold wall, her eyes wide open until morning crept in.


When dawn broke, the haze in her vision slowly cleared. She pushed her head up with effort, every muscle stiff and uncooperative. A sharp ache twisted in her abdomen, and even breathing felt heavy.



An endless night of wrestling with her thoughts had carved one truth into her heart-Julian didn't care for her. Clinging to him would only destroy her spirit and endanger the child within her.



If he despised the baby, then she would love it all the more.



Clutching the toilet for balance, Yvonne forced herself to stand. She staggered out of the bathroom and asked a servant to cook her something ligght.


The staff knew better than to meddle. They had long understood the strained bond between their employers and stayed silent.


On the sofa, Yvonne spooned porridge into her mouth,and with each swallow, a bit of warmth trickled back  into her frail body.


Her moment of peace ended when Sebastian Price,the butler, entered with two servants hefting a large canvas.



He bowed politely. "Mrs. Powell, this is the painting Mr.Powell commissioned for his grandfather's birthday.Will you and Mr. Powell be attending the celebration together?"



Her heart stuttered as the date struck her-Rodger's birthday. The marriage contract demanded she and Julian appear inseparable and they visit Rodger during holidays and family occasions, especially on this day.


But after the bitterness of last night, shecouldn't imagine standing beside Julian and pretending.



Even so, Yvonne had no escape. She sent a message with trembling fingers, saying, "Will you be going with me to the Powell Mansion for Rodger's birthday?"


No reply came. Her chest tightened as she forced herself to call him. The phone rang, then fell silent,unanswered.



Maybe he was still in Rita's bed, too exhausted to pick up.


For a split second, Yvonne's mind emptied, leaving her frozen in place. She forced her lips into a faint smile as she said, "I'll head over ahead of him."



Sebastian gave a slight bow, his calm expression hinting that he had already expected her answer.



Choosing not to dwell on it, Yvonne retreated to her room. The mirror reflected a face drained by a sleepless night, shadows etched beneath her eyes.She painted on foundation layer by layer,trying to hide what rest had failed to restore.



By the time she walked outside, the familiar car slid through the gates. The window lowered, and one detail struck her instantly-Julian wore clothes he hadn't left the house in the night before.


Her lashes lowered as her hands curled tight, digging crescents into her palms.



The truth was plain. He had spent the night with Rita,even taking the time to change into something from her place.



Julian's voice broke through her thoughts. "Get in."



Her teeth caught her lower lip before she responded,"Sebastian can drive me."



He shot her a piercing glance, his voice cold and cutting. "Do you really want Grandfather to notice any trouble between us?" The words lodged in her throat. With no choice, she opened the door and sat stiffly beside him.


Silence pressed down inside the car, neither willing to speak first.



A sidelong glance at him made her stomach twist. His clothes, his uncharacteristic casualness, all carried Rita's fingerprints.



The thought sickened her. Her chest heaved, and suddenly she gagged.



Julian's brows drew together as he turned toward her,startled, but before he could ask anything,Yvonne snapped her gaze away and stared coldly out the window.



She decided to match his silence, giving him the very treatment he had so often used on her.



The drive crawled by without a single word spoken between them.



When the car rolled to a stop at the Powell Mansion's gates, she unfastened her seatbelt before it fully braked and got out, striding forward with quick steps.


Julian caught up in only a few strides, his hand closing firmly around hers. Irritation sharpened his voice."Enough of this. Do you want Grandfather to see us at odds and expect me to bend to you?"


She inhaled deeply,shoving down her disappointment until only a brittle smile remained. "Relax. I'll play the role. Rodger won't suspect a thing."


His lips flattened into a thin, unyielding line. After a tense pause, he murmured indifferently, "You'd better mean that."



The coldness in his tone hollowed her out.Memories of nights spent yearning for him blurred her eyes with unshed tears, but she clung to one fragile hope."Then promise me something in return."



His brow creased, and her fists tightened until her nails bit her skin. Keeping her voice steady,she added,"Cut ties with her. If we're going to act like an inseparable couple, we can't let whispers of your affair reach the family. It'll ruin everything."



Even as the plea left her lips, she hated how small it made her sound. Still, some stubborn corner of her heart wanted to salvage their broken marriage.


To Julian, it was nothing but another unreasonable demand. He gave a sharp,mocking laugh, preparing to bite back.



Before he could, a firm voice, aged yet commanding,drifted from inside the mansion. "And what is it y/Ou two are discussing?” Rodger sat in his wheelchair, which was wheeled by Jordy Powell, Julian's father.
###Chapter 5 Morning Sickness
 The sudden appearance of Rodger and Jordy shattered the intense disagreement that had settled between Julian and Yvonne.



Julian's expression shifted in an instant, his lips curving into a warm smile as he slipped an arm around Yvonne's shoulders.


"Grandpa," he said smoothly, voice laced with forced calm, "Yvonne's upset because she thinks the gift l chose isn't impressive enough."



While the words flowed easily from his mouth, his eyes flicked toward her with a sharp, unspoken warning.



Yvonne almost laughed at the sheer artistry of his performance. Compared to him,she felt like a clumsy novice, managing only a stiff smile and a small nod.


Rodger's booming laughter filled the air, his gaze twinkling with teasing warmth as it landed on her."What more could I ask for than seeing the two of you so harmonious? But if you really want to give me the best gift, then bring me a strong great-grandchild soon." Without meaning to, Yvonne's hand drifted to her stomach, her eyes lowering as a shadow of sorrow crossed her face.



She carried that very child inside her, yet deep down she doubted Julian wanted it to exist.



Noticing the shift in her expression, Julian quickly interjected, eager to steer the moment away. "Let's not linger here. Everyone must be waiting inside."



The group moved into the lavishly adorned living room,where the younger generation of the Powell family had already gathered.


As they entered, Nadine Powell, Julian's aunt, glided forward with a warm smile, slipping her hand into Yvonne's and looking her over with concern. "How are you holding up, dear? You look thinner than before.Has Julian been considerate enough?"



Julian, standing just behind, looped an arm around Yvonne's waist and replied with mock indignation,"Aunt Nadine,how could I ever fail to take care of her?"



Though Yvonne recognized it for the empty act it was,her chest gave a faint flutter. She tilted her head upward just as he looked down, and for the briefest second, something softer seemed to linger in his eyes



Right then, a gentle voice drifted in fromn the doorway. "Julian."



Every head in the room turned, revealing Rita standing meekly just behind Sharon Powell, Julian's mother.


The atmosphere thickened at once, the cheerful chatter collapsing into uneasy silence.


Rodger's expression hardened, his eyes narrowing on Sharon.His voice thundered across the room. "This is a family gathering. Why would you bring an outsider here?"



Caught off guard, Sharon's cheeks flushed with embarrassment. "I only ran into Rita during a yoga class. She said she wanted to offer you birthday wishes..."



Rodger cut her off with a sharp glare. "I don't need empty greetings from a shallow woman like her,who only chases after wealth. Have you all forgotten the disgrace she caused us back then?"



No one dared answer. The Powells exchanged silent,knowing looks. Yvonne alone stayed bewildered,her thoughts racíng.



What disgrace? What had happened back then?Wasn't it Rodger who had pushed Julian into marrying her in the first place?



Sharon's eyes flicked briefly toward Yvonne but  quickly turned away. Her tone softened as she said,"There was a misunderstanding before. And Rita didn't just come to offer her wishes. She's a close friend of Dr. Jarrod Carter, the renowned heart surgeon. His team has been working on a new specialty medicine that could ease your chronic heart ailment."



At those words, Nadine's and Jordy's faces changed in an instant. Their cool disdain melted into eager anticipation as their gazes fixed on Rita. Even Julian's guarded expression faltered, surprise flashing across his eyes as he looked at her.


Rodger's failing heart had long weighed over the family, a shadow no physician had managed to lift.Age only worsened the condition, stealing his strength and leaving the Powells anxious with every passing year.



For them, the promise of a new specialty medicine was more precious than gold. If it truly existed, they would pay any price to secure it.


At once, the family crowded around Rita, hope flickering in their eyes.


Julian stepped forward, his voice urgent. "Rita, how do you know Dr. Carter? Can this specialty medicine really work for my grandpa?"


Encircled by the crowd, Rita gave a timid smile and answered in a gentle voice, which only deepened Yvonne's sense of being alone and set apart from everyone else.



Her teeth pressed into her lip as she watched. To Yvonne, it felt like Rita was the one who truly belonged, while her own place in the Powell family existed only because she carried the title of Julian's wife.



The idea haunted her. If they ever discovered Rita was carrying Julian's child, she was certain the family would welcome Rita far more than her.



Rodger,however, wasn't swayed by talk of medicine or promises of cures. Instead, his expression darkened,and he struck the armrest of his wheelchair with a sharp smack to silence the room.


Fixing Rita with a stern glare, Rodger asked, "Tell me,what is your real reason for coming back this time?"



Rita flinched at his words, clutching at Julian's sleeve as tears brimmed in her eyes. "Rodger, I only wanted to see Julian again. I don't have any other motives..."


Julían placed a hand on her shoulder, his voice gentling as he leaned in to comfort her.


The sight made Yvonne's stomach twist. She clamped a hand over her mouth and stumbled out of the room,rushing to the bathroom to vomit. The Powell family was caught off guard, and Nadine leaned in to whisper softly, "Yvonne's condition looks like the early signs of pregnancy, like morning sickness."



Julian's eyes narrowed at once, his expression unreadable as a storm of thoughts crossed his mind.
###Chapter 6 Confirmation



Yvonne felt weak after retching, her knees still trembling as she lifted her gaze to the mirror.The pale,worn-out facestaring back at her made her chest tighten. With a heavy sigh, she splashed cold water over her face, then dabbed on a quick layer of makeup to cover the fatigue before stepping out.



The last thing she expected was Julian waiting at the door. He stood against the wall with a lazy elegance,arms folded, one leg crossed over the other, as though he had been there all along. A knot of unease tightened in her chest.



Before she could decide what to say, he held out a crisp handkerchief,its faint scent startlingly fresh.



Caught off guard, she took it hesitantly. "Thanks."


Julian's eyes, dark and unreadable, fixed on her. you sick? I heard you were nauseous during the gathering yesterday too. I've already arranged for you to see a doctor this afternoon."



Her breath faltered. She wanted to refuse,but his tone left no room for choice-it wasn't a suggestion but a command. Without waiting for her response, he turned and walked away,leaving her rooted to the spot, her mind spinning.



Now was the worst possible time to reveal her pregnancy. Julian already had Rita carrying his child,and with the family's affection leaning toward that woman, she was certain he would choose Rita over her.



Drifting through a haze of worry, Yvonne slipped out of the bathroom and wandered down the hallway. Her steps slowed as voices of Jordy and Sharon floated from the study, tension sharp enough to stop her in her tracks.



She hadn't meant to eavesdrop, but Jordy's frustration echoed into the hall,impossible to ignore.



"Why bring Rita here of all days? Are you trying to humiliate Yvonne on purpose?" asked Jordy.



Sharon sounded close to tears, her voice brittle. "Do you honestly think I wanted this? Rita confided in me -she's expecting."



A heavy silence followed. When Jordy finally spoke,his disbelief was clear. "Are you telling me Julian's the father?"



Sharon's voice dropped to a hush, yet every word was edged with certainty. "Julian took her to the hospital just days ago. If the child isn't his, why would he go to such lengths?"



A weary sigh slipped from Jordy. "I never imagined Julian and Rita would cross paths again, let alone reconcile. And there is Yvonne-I feel pity for her."



Sharon's answer came without hesitation. "Whether we like it or not, Rita carries Julian's child. He never cared for Yvonne, and I doubt he'd want a child with her. This baby must be protected."



Jordy's tone hardened, leaving no room for debate."Yvonne can't know. If she finds out now,it will only humiliate her further."



What neither of them realized was that Yvonne had already heard enough.



Frozen at the study door, she felt her heart cave in at the confirmation that Rita was indeed carrying Julian's child.



Terrified they might notice her, she scrubbed the tears from her cheeks and fled down the hall, her chest tight with grief.



By the time she composed herself and rejoined the others in the living room, Jordy and Sharon had returned as well. Conversations halted, and all eyes landed on her, the air thick with awkward unease. Rodger's face creased with concern as he asked gently,"Yvonne, you don't look well. Should I call my physician to check on you?"



She forced a quick shake of her head. "There's no need, Rodger. The change in weather has just upset my stomach a little."



Rita lingered nearby, her gaze sharp. A fleeting, cold smile flickered at her lips. She had done her investigation and uncovered the truth-Yvonne was pregnant. It was news she swore the Powell family could never be allowed to discover.



Her return carried only one goal-to take Yvonne's place and become Julian's wife, no matter the cost.



With Yvonne hiding her pregnancy, she would be a fool not to exploit the opportunity.


That thought in mind, she slipped a small bottle of pills from her handbag, arranging her features into gentle concern. She stepped toward Yvonne and said sweetly, "Yvonne, you should try this if you're not feeling well. Dr. Carter's team created it. I used to struggle with stomach issues, but ever since I started on this, I've barely felt sick at all."


Sharon's lips curved into a smile as she added warmly,"If Dr. Carter's team developed it, then it must be reliable." Rita's eyes widened innocently, though her voice carried a subtle edge. "There's just one thing-it's not safe for expectant mothers. It can cause miscarriages.But of course, you can take it, Yvonne... you're not pregnant,right?"



The room fell into silence as every gaze shifted to Yvonne. In one breath, Rita had cornered her completely.



Yvonne's fingers curled into her palm, hidden from view, though her lips lifted in a calm smile as she accepted the bottle. "Thank you, Rita. I'll take it later."


Rita urged, "You shouldn't wait-take it now, and you won't have any stomach pain later. Let me fetch you some water." She hurried to pour a glass and placed it before Yvonne with exaggerated care.



To the family, Rita's actions looked full of kindness.But to Yvonne, Rita's eyes told a different story-sharp with challenge, glinting with malice.


Yvonne narrowed her gaze slightly, though her lips curving upward. "Alright then, I'll take it now."


Under the weight of everyone's stares, she slipped a pill into her hand and lifted it toward her mouth.
###Chapter 7 Flee


Yvonne's every move had Rita practically buzzing with anticipation. She wished more than anything to force that pill into Yvonne's mouth herself.



If Yvonne lost the baby, she'd no longer be a problem.


Right before the pill reached Yvonne's lips, a hand shot out and seized her wrist.



Yvonne jumped, glancing over to find Julian standing there,his face unreadable. He gave her wrist a steady shake until the pill tumbled from her grasp and hit the floor.



Turning to Rita, Julian said without much emotion, "I'LL take her to the hospital and get things checked out.She shouldn't take any medicine until we know exactly what's happening."



Annoyance flashed across Rita's features, though she managed to plaster on a gentle smile. "Of course,you're right. It's safer that way."



While Yvonne traced her wrist where Julian had touched her, warmth still lingering, her feelings twisted up inside. Maybe he was worried about her. The idea barely had time to settle before she brushed it away, a bitter little smile on her lips. Why let herself get fooled again?Most likely, Julian just wanted to put on a show for Rodger.


With a shake of her head, she forced herself to let it go, not realizing that Julian's gaze lingered on her for a long moment.



Trying to lighten the mood, Sharon suggested they all sit down for lunch.



Sharing a table with Rita left Yvonne with no appetite.An uncomfortable heaviness settled over the meal,making the atmosphere feel stifling.



As soon as she could, Yvonne rose from her seat,snatched up her bag, and turned to Rodger to say goodbye.



Rodger raised his gaze, his tone full of concern as he glanced at Julian, who was still deep in conversation with Rita. "Are you planning to visit the hospital by yourself? Wasn't Julian supposed to go with you?"



Swallowing her annoyance, Yvonne decided not to call Julían out. She offered a patient reply."Of course Julian's coming with me."


 
She then called over to him, making sure her words carried. "Honey, it's time to head to the hospital."


Hearing her call him "honey," Julian grew noticeably tense.Even knowing she was only acting, he still felt his heart skip a beat.


He walked away from Rita and approached Yvonne,picking up her bag as if it were the most natural thing in the world. "Come on, let's get going," he said,his tone gentle.


As they bid farewell to the Powell family and walked toward the door, they appeared the picture of a devoted couple.



Strolling through the garden, they heard hurried footsteps behind them.



Rita caught up, her face drained of color as she quietly pleaded with Julian, "Julian, I don't feel well. Can you drop me home first? I really don't want to go to the hospital."



Julian's eyes shifted to Yvonne, clearly torn. After a moment, he spoke up. "I'll have the driver take you to the hospital, Yvonne. I need to get Rita home first."


Yvonne had expected this, but it still stung. She forced a casual smile. "Go on.It's fine."



Wasting no more time, Julian turned to walk away with Rita. Left standing by herself, Yvonne fought back tears.She blinked fast, but the tears spilled over anyway.


Trying to stay positive, she reminded herself that at least there would be no need to come up with lies about her pregnancy.


Choosing some solitude, she set off for home on foot,hoping the walk would help her settle down.


As she was leaving the neighborhood, her phone vibrated. An unknown number had sent her a video,the preview showing Julian's familiar profile behind the wheel.



Confused,she opened the message and tapped on the video. The clip began with Julian driving, while Rita's voice floated in from the side.



"Julian, what if Yvonne really is pregnant? Would you take responsibility for the child?"



That question made Yvonne freeze. She paused the video, her heart beating fast. Her finger hovered over the screen, torn between curiosity and dread.


Did Julian truly want her to have the baby? She found herself needing to know.



Taking a steadying breath, she hit play once more.
###Chapter 8 Suffocating Ache
The video rolled on, every frame heavy with inevitability.


Julian's voice rang out, cool and detached,like a final judgment handed down from on high. "We were never going to have children."


After a brief pause, his words landed like a blade,driving straight at Yvonne through the screen. "Even if she were expecting, I would arrange for her to abort.Our marriage is nothing but a contract."


Yvonne's hand quivered, her knuckles pale from the force of her grip. The phone slipped through her trembling fingers and clattered against the ground with a sharp crack.



She had braced herself for cruelty, had rehearsed hearing the worst-but the unfeeling finality in Julian's voice still hollowed her out, leaving her chest tight and her breath shallow as the truth carved straight through her defenses.



The video still hadn't ended. Rita's syrupy voice cut through the silence like a whip across Yvonne's skin."What about the child I'm carrying?" Yvonne's chest constricted. Against her will, her eyes darted toward the phone lying on the ground, as if she could drag the answer out with sheer desperation.


A suffocating silence stretched on in the video. From the camera's angle, Julian's face remained hidden, his expression unreadable, his thoughts locked away.



"I'll take care of you and the child." His reply came at last-brief, unyielding, and mercilessly decisive.


Hot tears flooded Yvonne's eyes. Yet, almost punishing herself, she kept replaying the video, again and again, as though repeated exposure might somehow dull the sting of his heartlessness.



But she had overestimated her strength. Each replay carved deeper into her chest, until the agony dulled into a hollow numbness.



Without warning, Yvonne clutched her chest and gasped, her body collapsing against a cold roadside pillar.



The suffocating ache was no longer a metaphor-it was terrifyingly real. Her breaths came short and shallow,each one harder to draw.



Then a stabbing pain twisted through her abdomen,and dread surged instantly. Cold sweat streamed down her pale face. Gripping the pillar for balance, she slid into a crouch,her whole body trembling with fear.



Her eyes burned as tears blurred her vision, and she groped for the fallen phone on the ground. When the screen lit up, her finger hovered over one name, then stilled.



She asked herself whether she needed to call Julian.No-he could never learn about the baby.



She bit her lower lip hard, then scrolled and tapped another contact.



The line connected almost instantly, and a gentle male voice, laced with a touch of surprise, filled her ear. "Hello? Yvonne? Why are you calling me out of the blue? Did something happen?"



"L..." Yvonne opened her mouth, but before words could form, a sudden dampness spread beneath her.Glancing down, she froze in horror at the sight of blood pooling faintly onto the ground.


Her mind went blank. Trembling, she choked out."Spencer...I-I think I'm losing my baby!"







At Kumvine Medical Center, a man in a crisp white coat stood at the bedside. His tall frame and long legs lent him an imposing presence, his sculpted features almost too perfect, like a portrait brought to life. Yet the hard line of his brows carried the sharp, unyielding weight of authority.



Spencer Briggs's voice cut through the sterile room,deep and severe. "If I had been even a little later,you wouldn't have been able to keep this baby."


Lowering her gaze, Yvonne sat quietly, shoulders hunched like a reprimanded student enduring a lecture.Whenever Spencer spoke in that clipped,scolding tone, it meant he was truly furious.


And she couldn't blame him. Dragging a world-renowned neurosurgeon away from his work only to make him act as her obstetrician-anyone would find that infuriating.



Spencer drew in a steady breath, forcing down the edge in his voice. When he spoke again,it carried a gentler warmth. "Your pregnancy is fragile right noW.You need to stay calm, rest properly, and avoid stress.Do you understand?"


"| will," Yvonne answered softly, her gaze lifting to meet his. A faint shimmer lingered in her eyes."Spencer... thank you."


The gratitude in her voice was quiet but genuine, carrying the weight of her heart.


Spencer and Yvonne had grown up side by side,inseparable as children. Yet after Yvonne's marriage to Julian, she slowly pulled away from her crcle,letting every old friendship fade.


Spencer remained the rare exception. Even after years of distance, one call from her was enough to bring him running, and she silently vowed to hold this friendship close.


When Spencer's gaze met hers, the warmth in his eyes was shadowed by a storm of unspoken feelings.After wrestling with the thought, he finally asked,his voice low, "Why isn't Julian here with you?"


The question carved through her like a blade.Yvonne's chest tightened,her weary eyes fixed on the emptiness before her. With a heaviness that seemed to drain the very air around her, she murmured, "I'm going to divorce him."
###Chapter 9 Message



The steady rush of water from the bathroom in Rita's apartment stirred a flood of suggestive thoughts.



Standing by the doorway, Rita held out a set of men's pajamas, her cheeks tinged pink as she gave a timid knock. "Julian, I brought you something to wear."


There was a short pause before Julian answered from within, his tone distant, "Just leave them outside the door."



Hearing that, Rita's smile faded, and disappointment flashed in her eyes. She glanced down at the pile of Julian's clothes, carelessly dropped by the bathroom entrance.



His expensive gray suit was marked by a large coffee stain, and his phone had slipped out of the pocket.


A spark of intrigue lit up Rita's eyes. At that moment,the phone buzzed and the screen illuminated. It was a message from Yvonne.


Her pulse quickened as she cast a glance at the bathroom. Moving with care, she reached for his phone. The screen displayed Yvonne's message. "Will you be home tonight? I need to talk to you about something."


To Rita,it was obvious what Yvonne was after; she scoffed at Yvonne's scheme, sure that Yvonne only wanted to lure Julian back to her side.



A faint, mocking laugh slipped from Rita at the thought. She entered the password she'd memorized after casually noticing it a few times when Julian wasn't careful.



Still on edge, afraid Julian might appear at any second,Rita decided not to linger. She hurried to open Yvonne's chat and typed. "I'm busy right now. Don't message me."


She sent the message with a hint of satisfaction,quickly erasing the chat history afterward. Just as she moved to slip the phone back into Julian's suit pocket,the bathroom door suddenly opened


Julian stepped out, catching her red-handed, still holding his phone.


Rita stood there, frozen in place, comforted only by the fact that she'd already wiped the conversation.


He stared at the phone in her hand, a deep frown settling on his face. "What are you doing with that?" Rita avoided his gaze, but her movements were swift as she passed the phone back with a look of feigned innocence. "It slipped to the floor, so I picked it up for you."



Julian accepted the phone and went straight to the chat with Yvonne. The most recent message was his own, asking if she had reached the hospital, but she hadn't responded. Growing annoyed, he locked the phone.



Rita,still wearing a wounded look, handed over the pajamas. "I'm really sorry, Julian. I was so careless with the coffee.Please change into these."



Wrapped in nothing but a towel, Julian's broad shoulders and toned physique caught Rita's hungry stare.



Back when she'd let him go, she never imagined she'd regret it, but seeing him now, successful and striking,she refused to lose her chance again.



While Julian looked at the pajamas, his thoughts drifted. He remembered the way Yvonne's eyes lingered on him when he'd worn something out of his character that morning.



A strange question popped up-was Yvonne feeling jealous? On a sudden whim, Julian reached for his coffee-stained suit and pulled it back on. He looked at Rita and spoke flatly. "Don't worry about it. Since you're fine, I'm heading home."



Rita's hopeful smile faded in an instant. In desperation,she wrapped her arms around his waist. "It's already so late. Can't you stay with me?"



He gave her a stern look, then pulled her hands away with no hesitation. "You've gone too far, Rita."



Frozen in disbelief, Rita could only watch as Julian left the apartment without so much as a glance back.Resentment slowly twisted across her face.


Back when they were still a couple, Julian would never walk away from her like this. Now, though, his patience had clearly run out.


In her mind, all of this was Yvonne's fault.



Moving to the window, Rita stared at Julian's car pulling away, a wicked smile curling her lips. "I underestimated you, Yvonne. But don't get too comfortable. Sooner or later, Julian will be mine,and only mine."
###Chapter 10 Blocked



Julian entered the villa, finding nothing but darkness waiting for him. A frown creased his brow as he flicked on the lights. By habit, he reached behind to hand off his suit jacket, only to realize that nobody was there to take it. The empty hallway made him pause, leaving him momentarily thrown off.



Back then, opening this door always revealed Yvonne waiting beneath the warm light, smiling as she came forward to take his suit jacket and coax him toward dinner.



Tonight, the dining table stood bare, and not a soul waited nearby.



A tight line formed on his lips, irritation rising as he wondered why she still hadn't come back.


The noise awakened the housekeeper, Paula Tucker,and she rushed out to see what was happening.



Spotting Julian,she froze for a brief moment before awkwardly taking the suit jacket from his hands. "Mr.Powell, I'm so sorry. We assumed you wouldn't be coming back tonight, so we turned in early..."


Watching Paula struggle with his jacket, Julian couldn't help but think how differently Yvonne would have handled it, always smoothing out every crease.The small detail only soured his mood further.



He cut to the point. "Where's Yvonne? Hasn't Sebastian taken her back from the hospital?"



After a brief pause, Paula spoke up truthfully."Sebastian didn't take Mrs. Powell to the hospital today. She said she could manage on her own and told him to return ahead of her."



The chill in Julian's voice was unmistakable. "She went by herself? Where is she now?"



Paula, flustered, spoke with extra care. "She hasn't come home at all tonight. She called to leave a few instructions... She mentioned she won't be back until you give her an answer about that issue."


That answer caught Julian off guard. "What issue?"


Paula gave a small, puzzled shake of her head, which only deepened Julian's confusion. Pulling out his phone, he typed a message to Yvonne. "Where are you?"



His screen flashed with a red exclamation mark; he had been blocked. The realization left him speechless.


Paula caught sight of his screen and gasped, eyes wide.Yvonne, the woman who had once loved Julian so deeply, had actually blocked him? What could have possibly led to this?


Julian felt Paula's eyes on him, and fury surged through him. He slammed his phone onto the table,then snatched it back, frustration simmering. Without thinking, he searched his contacts and tried calling Yvonne.



The call didn't go through; she had also blocked his number, just as he'd feared. His expression turned even colder.



Paula stood there, shrinking under the tension, eyes downcast.



All at once, Julian spun sharply and headed for the door.



Holding his suit jacket close, Paula hesitated before softly asking, "Mr. Powell, should I have this sent to the cleaners?"



Yvonne used to handle every detail for Julian, so the staff rarely knew what to do on their own.


He stopped in his tracks, irritation lacing his words."Just throw it away."


As Paula started to obey, Julian spun around and walked back to her, his face unreadable. "Hand me your phone." No amount of reasoning could make him accept that Yvonne had really blocked him. He was set on finding out exactly why.



Paula faltered for a moment before gathering the nerve to speak. "Did you and Mrs. Powell have an argument? Maybe a calm conversation can help smooth things..."


A memory of their last argument flashed in Julian's mind. At the time, he'd brushed off Yvonne's concerns,thinking she was making a fuss over nothing.In hindsight, everything had shifted after that night.


Yvonne had pulled away, leaving him uneasy, as if he was losing control over something important.


Maybe he should never have picked that fight with her that night.


He couldn't shake the regret, though his face stayed hard. "Your phone, Paula."



Paula didn't say another word as she handed her phone to him, nerves making her hands shake.



Without a pause, Julian keyed in Yvonne's number smoothly and waited for the call to go through.



The call was answered almost instantly this time, and Yvonne's soft voice came through. "Hello? Paula?" Julian tightened his lips before answering in a low,steady tone, "It's me."
###Chapter 11 Divorce Agreement
A heavy silence hung in the air after Julian spoke.When Yvonne finally replied, her voice had lost all warmth."Anything?"



Hearing that,Julian's frown deepened. He wasn't used to her icy tone and responded with even less emotion,"Tell me where you are."



"It doesn't concern you. I'm busy, and I'd rather not be bothered," Yvonne said,her reply sharp. She ended the call before he could say another word.



Julian stared at the phone, stunned by what had just happened.He barely managed to keep his composure."She actually hung up on me?"



Paula looked at him nervously. "Did you do something to upset her, Mr. Powell? Maybe you should do something special to make it up to Mrs. Powell."


Julian didn't answer right away, his features clouded as he tried to piece everything together.


His thoughts drifted back to that night Yvonne begged him to stay when Rita's discomfort drove him to visit her. Explaining something so minor never appealed to him,yet if Yvonne kept pressing, it would only shatter the calm he enjoyed now.



Now that Rodger was finally getting better, the last thing Julian wanted was to let his grandfather stress over things between him and Yvonne.



"You should really talk to her, Mr. Powell. Most women just want to feel appreciated. A small surprise goes a long way." From the side, Paula tried to encourage him.



That suggestion sparked a memory. Yvonne had recently posted a picture of a puppy on Instagram,gushing about how adorable it was. She clearly loved little animals.



Hiding any hint of his frustration, Julian reached for his phone and called his assistant, Morton Perry. His voice was firm. "Track down Yvonne's location."



He paused for a moment, then cleared his throat before saying, "There's an auction coming up in a few days. A purebred poodle's on the list. I want you to win it for me."



Morton responded right away, "Understood, sir."


A surge of irritation washed over Julian as he ended the call. An uneasy sensation settled in as he took a slow look around the empty villa.


A question nagged at him-for the past three years,had Yvonne been waiting alone in this cold house for him to come home from work every day?


Usually, Julian didn't dwell on the past, but today,every corner seemed to whisper her name.


He wandered into the bedroom, where the perfectly made bed greeted him. His expression grew darker.


Memories surfaced, he and Yvonne had once shared their first intimacy on that very bed, just like any married couple would.


The more he dwelled on the details of that night, the more restless he felt, A dry, uneasy feeling crept over him, and he headed straight for a cold shower.


When morning broke, Julian woke at six, heading to the home gym as usual.



Finishing a round of exercises, he glanced at the empty spot beside him. He remembered the days when Yvonne would linger there, watching him with adoring eyes while he worked out at home.



That emptiness left him unsettled long before the day had even started.


After wiping the sweat from his brow, he walked out  of the gym and into the dining room, where a plate of plain toast and a glass of milk waited on the table.


Yvonne always went out of her way to cook a bowl of warm porridge for him, knowing how sensitive his stomach was. She'd serve it with fresh, light side dishes, nothing like the bland breakfast the staff had set out today.


A rush of frustration made his fists clench, his stare icy.


Ignoring the meal, he grabbed his phone and used a different number to text Yvonne. "Come home, let's talk things over."


This time, his message didn't get blocked.


Then, thinking he sounded too harsh, he worried Yvonne might dig in her heels even more. He followed up with a softer note. "I bought a puppy for you. It's adorable. Come see it."



That message bounced back, she'd blocked this number as well.



He sat there, lost for words.



Just then, Paula walked in with a stack of packages and set an envelope on the table.


She glanced his way. "You have a letter, Mr. Powell.Looks urgent, seems to be from Mrs. Powell." The icy mask Julian wore faded for a split second, and a small,self-satisfied smile tugged at his lips. He tried to act like it didn't matter, but he tore the letter open the moment Paula dropped it.



However, when he got a full understanding of the content, his smile vanished at once.
Inside the envelope was a divorce agreement.
###Chapter 12 Found Someone Else

Julian's expression turned to stone as he stared down at the divorce papers. Without a word, he let out a dry laugh, snatched up the agreement, and tore it into pieces.


The shredded paper drifted to the floor, scattering everywhere.



Paula, standing off to the side, was visibly nervous.She kept her eyes on the floor, hoping not to draw any attention.


Despite the tension in the air, Julian's next question came out steady. "Where was this letter sent from?"



Paula faltered, and her voice trembled, "I,I don't know."



Julian massaged his temples, realizing Yvonne would never make it easy for him to track her down if she was determined to keep her distance.


In his mind, she'd gone overboard this time. Clearly,she wanted to make a scene, probably to get Rodger involved and take her side.



Julían felt no guilt over his actions. To him, Yvonne  was simply blowing things out of proportion.


A sudden bark cut through the tension. Looking toward the door, Julian saw Morton arrive, holding a small puppy in his arms.



The puppy's irresistible charm drew a rare softness from Morton, and his usual sternness faded as he cradled it with a faint, gentle smile.



Julian's mood, however, only worsened at the sight.The puppy was meant for Yvonne, and now the gesture felt hollow.



Before Morton could come in fully, Julian waved him off. "Forget it. Take the dog with you. I don't want it anymore."



Morton froze in disbelief."What?"



After years of working for Julian, he still couldn't predict his boss's sudden changes in mood.


Julian had been thrilled about getting the puppy just yesterday, yet now he didn't want it at all. Had he gotten into a fight with Yvonne?


Morton shot a glance at Paula, who gave a tiny nod.in response. The two exchanged a silent understanding.



Julían paid no mind to their quiet signals. His attention remained on the envelope, his mood growing darker  by the second. His tone was harsh as he barked out an order. "I want Yvonne's location in one hour. No excuses."







At Kumvine Hospital, Yvonne and Spencer had just walked out to the front entrance. While making their way down the steps, she slipped and twisted her ankle,prompting Spencer to catch her at once, worry written all over his face.



He immediately asked, "Did you hurt yourself?"



Yvonne pulled back gently, offering him a reassuring smile. "I'm alright. Thank you for everything these past few days. You can go back to work now, I'll manage."



Spencer flashed a lazy grin. "My schedule's clear. Let me see you home.I insist."



In reality, Spencer should have been preparing for an important medical conference in Soblon. His original flight was set for this afternoon, but just earlier, he pushed it back to another day.



He'd let his chance with Yvonne slip away three years ago, convinced there wouldn't be another. But now that he knew she didn't have a happy marriage,he refused to sit back and let the same regret consume him twice. Noticing Yvonne's hesitation, Spencer gave the bag in his hand a little shake. "These are your prenatal supplements. I can go over the instructions with you."


That left Yvonne with no good reason to turn him down, so she agreed. The moment she nodded,Spencer's face lit up and he set off with enthusiasm.



He pointed toward his car with a spark of excitement."It's right over there. Come on, let's go!"



Yvonne fell into step behind Spencer. Their friendship went back years, and as he kept the conversation lively, she couldn't help but let out a genuine laugh.


Unbeknownst to her, Julian was watching from a distance in his car.



The moment Julian had found out Yvonne was at the hospital, he had sped over without wasting a second.


He had arrived just in time to catch sight of Yvonne smiling and chatting freely with another man.



It struck him that he couldn't remember the last time she had looked at him with that kind of lively smile.



Julian's glare grew frosty as he watched her, a humorless laugh escaping him. A surge of anger roiled inside him. She'd really crossed a line this time, ignoring his messages, blocking his calls, vanishing from his life,and then sending him divorce papers. Was this all because she had found someone else? He'd never been treated like this by anyone, let alone humiliated in such a way.



His gaze locked onto Spencer's car as it slowly reversed out of its parking space.



Without warning, Julian floored the accelerator and shot straight toward Spencer's car.
###Chapter 13 Suffocating Possessiveness
Spencer eased the car out of the parking space,trading lighthearted chatter with Yvonne. But their laughter cut short when a sleek black luxury car shot toward them out of nowhere.



Startled, Spencer slammed on the brakes. The tires screeched, the car whipping in a half-spin before jerking to a halt-barely two feet from disaster.



Heart pounding, Spencer twisted toward Yvonne at once. "Yvonne,are you hurt?"



She clutched the seatbelt as if it were a lifeline, her knuckles white, her face drained of color. She only managed a small shake of her head, eyes wide with fear.



Fury tightening his jaw, Spencer tore at his seatbelt buckle, ready to storm out and confront the reckless driver.



Just then, the black car's headlights blinked in a deliberate rhythm-taunting, like a predator flashing its fangs.



Yvonne lifted a trembling hand to shield her eyes from the glare, peering through her fingers until the license plate came into focus. Her stomach lurched-Julian's car.



Almost immediately, her phone buzzed in her palm.The number flashing on the screen was unfamiliar,yet she knew without doubt it was Julian calling.



Her face darkened as she hesitated, then reluctantly swiped to answer.



Julian's voice cut through the line, cold and commanding, brooking no argument."Get out."


Her breath caught in her throat, defiance rising to her lips, but before she could speak, the call clicked off,leaving only the dead tone ringing in her ears.



Almost instantly, the car facing them blasted its horn,a sharp command for her to act.



Yvonne's teeth sank into her lip before she finally pushed the door open. Her hand barely touched the handle when Spencer caught it, his grip firm,his head shaking in protest.



His eyes burned as he stared at her. "Yvonne, don't do this."



He wasn't blind; the situation was clear enough. His glare cut toward Julian's car, simmering with hostility "No one has the right to force you into anything You're already divorcing him-there's no reason to let yourself be trapped again," Spencer said, his voice steady and resolute.



From inside the luxury car, Julian narrowed his eyes,locking onto Spencer in a cold, wordless standoff.He then set his eyes on their clasped hands, and a shadow passed over his face, his jaw tightening with unspoken fury.



The razor-sharp intensity of his stare made Yvonne's spine prickle. She snatched her hand away from Spencer's, her pulse quickening.



She knew Julian's temperament better than anyone -his possessiveness was a cage lined with knives. If she dared stay inside Spencer's car,he would surely drag Spencer into his storm.



"Don't worry about me," Yvonne murmured, forcing a fragile smile that didn't reach her eyes. She unlatched the door and stepped out, her movements heavy with reluctance as she walked toward Julian's car,waiting like a predator in the dark.



Inside, Julian reclined against the leather seat with ease, one hand drumming an idle rhythm on the steering wheel. His eyes tracked her approach,and the faint curve of satisfaction at his lips hinted at a victory only he recognized. 
Like a monarch who believed the world bent to his will,he radiated certainty that she wouldn't dare defy him.



Yvonne drew in a steadying breath, hating the domineering air that clung to Julian. To her,his sudden appearance had nothing to do with care or concern-only the flare of his suffocating possessiveness.



She had dared to break free, to file for divorce, and he clearly saw that act as nothing less than a direct challenge to his authority.



Her expression remained frosty as she settled into the passenger seat, buckling her seatbelt in silence,not sparing himn a word.



Julian's gaze lingered on her cold detachment,and the memory of that divorce agreement ignited a fresh wave of fury.


His lips curled into a mocking sneer. "So,you're really leaving me for him, is that it? You really do have terrible taste in men."



Julian's lips curved in a faint sneer. He knew exactly who Spencer was-the heir of Briggs Pharmaceutical Corporation. The Briggs family was wealthy, but in his eyes,still leagues below the Powell family.


Yvonne's brows knit together. She parted her lips,  wanting to clarify that she and Spencer were nothing more than friends. But before she could utter a word,Julian's volatile temper snapped. The engine roared as he slammed his foot down on the accelerator.



The sudden lurch sent the car surging forward,wrenching a startled gasp from Yvonne. Her hand shot to the grab handle for balance, panic flashing in her eyes. "What on earth are you doing? Slow down!"



Julian's face stayed cold, unreadable, as his foot pressed mercilessly on the gas.
###Chapter 14 Twisted Satisfaction
Julian's car shot down the road, weaving between vehicles at breakneck speed. Yvonne gripped the grab handle with white knuckles, her face drained of all color.



Inside the car, silence stretched between them.Julian's fury simmered just beneath the surface, a storm he barely kept contained.



Despite the chaos on the road, he maneuvered with flawless control, slipping through traffic at reckless speeds and skimming past several near collisions.


After narrowly missing another car, Yvonne's restraint broke, and her voice shook as she pleaded, "Please,slow down."



But the wind rushing past the windows drowned her out completely.



Fear mingled wit hurt, and Yvonne's composure finally broke. Tears streamed down her face as she crumpled into the seat, feeling lost and defenseless.



The sight of her curled up and sobbing snapped Julian back to reality. The car screeched to a sudden stop as  he slammed on the brakes. He started to say something, but Yvonne was already brushing away her tears and firmly pushing the door open to get out.



A new wave of frustration surged through Julian. He rarely let his emotions get the better of him, yet today they kept slipping through his grasp. Without even realizing it, he had already seized Yvonne and pulled her back, pinning her against the seat.



"Is that it? You can't wait to run off and see your new man?" His voice was harsh.



Yvonne froze, her eyes wide in disbelief. Her anger flared, and she let out a cold laugh. "And what does it matter to you?"


Julian stared at her, caught off guard by the defiance in her voice. She felt like a stranger now. Gone was the softness in her gaze; only mockery remained.



Her voice was sharper than ever as she threw his words back at him. "Let's not forget, Julian, our marriage is just a front for Rodger's sake. If I have someone else, it's none of your concern!"



He remembered his own promise from before, the freedom he'd granted her as long as appearances were kept for Rodger's sake.


Now, hearing those words thrown in his face,a wave of displeasure washed over him. A chill settled in his  gaze as he clenched his lips in silence.


Watching him unravel like that, Yvonne's expression shifted ever so slightly, touched by a trace of satisfaction, as if his frustration gave her some twisted sense of pleasure.



She suddenly looped her arms around his neck,drawing close. Julian could feel her breath at his ear,his own breath catching as tension crackled in the small space between them.



But her next words were as cold as ice. "I'm done playing this game, Julian. I want adivorce."


Her closeness vanished as quickly as it came, leaving Julian reeling-he couldn't tell if it was from rage or something deeper. All he knew was that his self-control unraveled.



Without thinking, he caught her by the neck, dragging her back and crushing her lips with his in a rough,desperate kiss.


Watching her recoil in shock, wiping her lips with shaking hands, Julian felt a twisted satisfaction.



She glared. "Have you lost your mind?"


He absentmindedly touched his lips, surprised at how soft hers had been; how had he never noticed that before? As Yvonne bristled, Julian pulled himself together, his voice cool and steady. "You want to call it quits now?Let's not rewrite history. You cornered me into this marriage with Grandpa's help. And now..."


Julian tilted Yvonne's chin upward, his gaze sharp and unyielding. "I'm the one steering this game," he said coldly. "You don't get to decide when it stops."

###Chapter 15 Kiss



Yvonne shook with fury, but when her gaze locked on Julian's eyes, the fire in her chest guttered out, leaving only a hollow ache. A broken laugh escaped her lips."Julian... I'm tired of this."



She lingered onhis face-the man she had clung to,loved fiercely for three long years. Her voice softened with regret. "I never should've forced you into this marriage. That was my mistake. I know now you don't love me, and I won't chain you anymore. Gofind your happiness. Just... let me go."


Julian's expression hardened, his mouth curling into a cold sneer. "Since when did you learn to play this kind of game, Yvonne? You're only talking like this because there's another man, aren't you?"


Her hands clenched, her eyes flashing. "Do you really not understand plain words?" Anger stirred beneath the grief in her chest, because no matter what, this man could always rattle her-whether it was joy or rage.



Her lips curved into a bitter smile."If you're allowed to crawl back to your old lover, why shouldn't I be free to find someone new?" Yvonne had once tiptoed around Julian, careful not to breathe wrong in his presence. Now, the sharp retorts rolled off her tongue with startling ease, leaving her with a strange, almost liberating lightness.



Her defiance,however, sent Julian's temper spiraling.


In the past, he could brush off her protests as nothing more than a wife's complaint, harmless bickering between spouses.


But this time she had crossed the line-she had admitted, without shame, to her involvement with Spencer.


Rage stripped him of control. His hand clamped tightly around her throat, forcing her chin upward until her eyes locked with his. With his other hand, he traced the corner of her lips in a deliberate, mocking caress.


His voice dropped into a cold, scathing whisper."So that's it? Spencer gets his thrill stealing another man's wife? Tell me, Yvonne... Have you already slept with him?"



Yvonne's eyes flew wide, shock freezing her in place.A heartbeat later, Julian's mouth crashed against hers again.



It was called a kiss, but it carried no warmth-just raw fury searchíng for release. No matter how desperately she twisted,his grip only grew harsher. He pinned her wrists above her head, deepening the brutal contact.



Her chest burned as if every trace of oxygen had been stolen away. Her mind reeled in a blank haze, leaving only the punishing pressure of his lips to remind her she was still conscious.



Once,she would have been both giddy and thrilled by Julian's desire. Now, tears blurred her vision as she struggled uselessly against his grasp,her whole body trembling in resistance. "Let me go!"



Her muffled plea was swallowed,turning the clash into a battle for air, for dominance, for control neither was willing to yield.



Suddenly, Julian drew in a ragged breath, finally releasing her and swiping the blood from the corner of his mouth. Yvonne's glare burned with blazing wrath and suspicion.



A sharp laugh broke from Julian, his eyes dark with simmering rage. He shoved open the door,and stepped into the night.



The sound of the passenger door unlocking sent a jolt of dread through Yvonne's chest. When the looming shadow fell across her, she instinctively shrank back to the other side. his arms, and strode forward without hesitation. Only then did Yvonne realize the car had already rolled to a stop inside the villa's courtyard.


Julian stormed straight into the bedroom, and Yvonne's heart leapt in panic. She hammered her fists against his chest, thrashing in desperation. "You jerk -put me down!"



He complied with ruthless ease, flinging her onto the plush bed. His gaze burned, tinged red like that night when lust had consumed him beyond reason.


Terror rippled through Yvonne as she scrambled back,arms instinctively guarding her stomach. "Julian, I don't want to..."



Her protest died when he lunged forward,tearing off his tie with one hand while prying her legs apart and hoisting them over his shoulders.



"As long as we're not divorced, you're still my wife,"he growled, his voice low and unyielding. ###Chapter 16 End It



The weather in June shifted in an instant, rain hammering against the glass in a relentless rhythm while lightning tore through the sky and thunder shook the ground.



Inside the bedroom, the air turned heavy and damnp,filled with Julian's deep, uneven breaths mingling with Yvonne's stifled sobs.



Her wrists were trapped above her head, and she trembled,tears streaming down her cheeks. His rough,calloused palm slid beneath her clothes, grazing the delicate curve of her waist in a slow, sensual stroke.



Her mind spun into chaos, an icy tremor sliding along her spine as goosebumps prickled her skin.



Julian bent close, teeth working loose the first button of her dress before his mouth trailed lower.He kissed and nipped along the line of her neck to her collarbone, leaving a faint sheen in his wake. Yvonne arched involuntarily, her cry breaking free-raw,breathless, and desperate.



Gone was the fury that had consumed him moments earlier. Now his touch was calculated, patient, every movement designed to provoke, as if determined to prove she still wanted him.


Yvonne's joy shimmered faintly beneath her pain. No matter how deeply she had been wounded, her feelings for Julian burned stubbornly on, and even the faintest brush of his hand could awaken a dangerous longing inside her. When he finally let go of her wrists,she didn't even remember to fight back.



His lips captured hers, and his fingers wove tightly with her own, mirroring that night that had been seared into her memory.



The images overlapped-then versus now. Back then,their encounter had been reckless, rough, fueled by alcohol and desperation. Tonight, his touch carried an unfamiliar tenderness, so careful that her lashes fluttered closed, her defenses dissolving as she yielded to the heat of the moment.


Julian's mouth trailed lower, brushing against the delicate spot that made her shiver. But before she could surrender completely, a sharp cramp twisted her stomach. A dull ache radiated from her lower belly,as though the child within her rebelled against what was happening.


Startled, Yvonne shoved Julian away and clamped a hand over her lips. She lurched toward the bathroom,retching violently. From where he lay, Julian froze, the only sound reaching him the harsh echo of her convulsions as she bent over the sink.



The rain's steady drumming dulled the spark between them, and Julian's expression grew as heavy as the storm outside. He fixed his gaze on his hands,his mouth clamped shut in a tight line.



The atmosphere had been flawless only moments ago,so there was no way Yvonne's sudden recoil meant she found his kisses repulsive. Her reaction felt eerily reminiscent of the last awkward scene at the family gathering.



When Yvonne stepped out of the bathroom,her complexion was drained of color, and unease flickered across her features. Julian wasn't the type to overlook things-he was sharp, far too sharp. With her bouts of nausea coming one after another, how could she possibly keep concealing her pregnancy?



As the thought crossed her mind, a glass of water slid into view. Julian's long fingers held it steady,his eyes locking on hers with unnerving certainty. "You're pregnant."


There was no question in his tone, only assertion.


Everything seemed to halt, leaving only the deafening drum of her heart. Julian's voice dropped lower, each word weighted with certainty. "You didn't take the pill that night, and every reaction since then screams pregnancy."



He moved closer, his calm intensity cornering her until there was nowhere to retreat.



Yvonne's throat tightened, words slipping away. After a silence that stretched like forever yet lasted only a heartbeat, she forced herself to answer, her tone carefully measured, "You're imagining things. Why on earth would I ever be carrying your child?"



His gaze sharpened, suspicion flickering in the narrow set of his eyes. "Is that so? Then why does it feel like you're hiding the truth from me?"


She lifted her chin, meeting his stare with stubborn defiance. "If I were ever pregnant with your child, I'd end it without hesitation. I refuse to bring a child into this world who'd grow up without a father's love."



Julian's face hardened into ice, the blow of her words cutting deeper than any betrayal ever could. Fury surged through him, and before he could think, he drove her back against the wall, his restraint splintering.



Just as his temper threatened to break loose, a firm knock shattered the moment. Sebastian's voice filtered in from outside. "Sir, the international conference is about to begin..."



Julian's jaw tightened, emotions warring across his features before he forced them back under control.At last, he stepped away, cold composure sliding back into place like armor.



He cast a frigid glance down at Yvonne and spoke with brutal detachment. "Good. It's for the best if you're not pregnant. You know damnn well there can't be a child between us." Without sparing her another look, he turned on his heel and strode out.



Yvonne's legs gave way the instant the door shut behind him. She sank to the floor, the echo of his voice replaying mercilessly in her mind. A hollow laugh escaped her, and as it bubbled up uncontrollably,tears spilled down her cheeks, streaking her face in a mix of grief and bitter irony.
###Chapter 17 Puppy



Knocking resounded through the room again, steady and persistent. Yvonne braced herself, wiping the last trace of tears from her cheeks, expecting Julian to return.



However, Sebastian appeared in the doorway instead.


A strange weight settled in her chest, disappointment pressing down even as she forced a polite smile. "Did you need something?"


With a small step to the side, Sebastian revealed a snow-white puppy that scampered in on short legs,tail wagging furiously as it bounded toward her with a playful grin.


Yvonne's eyes widened in surprise, her hand moving without thought to stroke its silky head. The warmth of its fur seemed to chase away the heavy fog inside her.



For the first time that day, her lips curved into a genuine smile as she looked up at him. "Where did you find this little one?"


A chuckle escaped him as he explained, "Mr. Powell noticed you've been down lately. He thought a puppy might help lift your spirits."



Her smile faltered, and she turned away with a faint,bitter laugh. "You don't have to invent stories for him."



They had been husband and wife for three years,yet Julian had never once done something so thoughtful.And only moments ago, they had quarreled bitterly.



It felt far more likely that Sebastian had brought the puppy himself, trying to soften the sharp edge between her and Julian.



A sigh slipped from Sebastian, out of pity for what he had seen over the years. Having served the Powell family for so long, he had watched Julian grow up,and he knew that affection did exist between the couple.



Still, certain truths were better left unsaid, and his role did not grant him the right to meddle.



He paused, uncertainty flickering across his face, then said with care, "Mr. Powell truly bought the puppy for you. He does care, even if he can't always show it.Some feelings are just hard for him to put into words..."



He did care? The words almost made her scoff, but she bit it back. Maybe Julian was capable of romance,but he'd never offered it to her.If he truly cared,how could there be a child with Rita?



Her silence told Sebastian enough. He didn't push again, only shook his head with resignation before stepping aside to leave.



Left alone, Yvonne bent down, stroking the puppy's head as her mind wandered over possible names.



She resolved to make the creature a proper home first. Dogs had always been dear to her, and with experience of building kennels, she knew she could give the puppy a place to belong.



Before long,Yvonne had crafted a finely built wooden house for the puppy, her hands moving with practiced ease.



Julian finished his meeting and stepped into the living room, only to pause when he spotted Yvonne lounging on the sofa in a soft nightdress, laughing as she played with the pup.



His pace slowed, the sharpness in his gaze dimming ever so slightly. Just as he started forward, her playful voice drifted across the room. "Julian, come on, let's hear you bark for me."



His face clouded, and tension crackled in the air.Sensing his presence, Yvonne glanced over and found him looming in the doorway, dressed in a black shirt,his posture rigid and stern as ever.


Even being caught off guard, she kept her composure.Matching his icy gaze, she bent down, scooped the puppy into her arms, and made for her room.



As she walked past, Julian's voice cut through the air,hard and unyielding. "You like this sort of thing?"Julian asked.



The cracks in their marriage had long since widened.He had mocked Spencer before, so to her ears, his words sounded like another insult, ridiculing her for treasuring something he considered worthless.



Her hold on the puppy tightened, her eyes burning with unshed tears. After three years of marriage, the only treasure she still clung to was her honest love for him.



But in Julian's eyes, she realized bitterly, her devotion was lumped into the same category as "worthless."



That thought pushed her to draw a slow breath.Without sparing him a glance, she answered in a voice chilled with defiance, "Whatever I like is none of your concern."



Her sharp reply brought back the memory of her bright smile at Spencer in the hospital lot, and the image stung him.



His frustration mounted, and his reply came out sharper than before. "You're right. It isn't my concern.But to avoid raising Grandpa's suspicion, you'll stay home and look after the puppy. Don't think about  leaving the house."


The words stunned her, and she turned in disbelief.Yet he was already walking away, his long strides leaving her rooted behind. Tears slipped down her cheeks as she hugged the puppy close.


If Sebastian's claim was true-that the puppy was a gift from Julian-then all she could see in it was his attempt to chain her inside these walls with a hollow gesture of compensation.



Julian, meanwhile, stormed into the garage,climbed into his car, and slammed the door. The night air rushed around him, easing the storm in his chest just enough for him to press his fingers against his temples.



Why was he losing control like this? Every time something involved Yvonne,his composure shattered.



Then his eyes caught on a bag bearing Kumvine Hospital's logo.Recognizing it as something Yvonne had left behind, he pulled it toward him and opened the opaque material. The sight inside made his brows knit at once.
###Chapter 18 Vitamin C!



The snow-white puppy sprawled lazily on the bedroom floor, its dark, curious eyes never leaving Yvonne as she moved about.



She opened her suitcase and began sliding in her neatly folded clothes, each motion methodical yet absent of energy



The task ended quickly, leaving her staring at the stacked fabric in silence until a sharp, self-mocking laugh slipped past her lips.



Her love for Julian had consumed her to the point of erasing herself, and now she realized how pitifully little in this house could truly be called her own.



She couldn't keep enduring. If Julian refused divorce,Rita would soon appear, pressing him to force her into giving up the child.



Resolve hardened in her gaze. One hand moved protectively to her abdomen as she whispered, voice steady with quiet defiance, "Baby, I won't let anyone hurt you."


A faint whimper from the puppy broke through her thoughts. Her expression softened. Bending down,she scooped the little creature into her arms, burying her face in its silky fur.



Her voice dropped into a tender murmur. "And you-would you like to come with me?"



The puppy licked her cheek with boundless enthusiasm,drawing a startled laugh from Yvonne. Stroking its soft fur, she decided then and there to name it Snowy.



Her lighthearted moment was cut short by a sudden knock at the door. The smile drained from her face as she turned toward it. "Come in."



Paula stepped inside, lips parting as if to speak-only for her gaze to land on the open suitcase. Whatever words she had prepared slipped away in surprise.


"Mrs. Powell, why... why are you packing?"she asked,her voice faltering.



Yvonne's mouth pressed into a tight line, torn about how to answer. She had already resolved to divorce;there was no point lingering in this house,living only in Julian's shadow.



Though Julian still refused to sign the papers, she had made up her mind. She would move out on her own terms and carve a fresh path for her career.



Yvonne knew that if she confided in Paula, the woman would do everything possible to stop her. Yvonne quickly steered the moment away. "Paula,what did you come here for?" she asked lightly.


That snapped Paula back to herself. "Oh-right!" She lifted the bag in her hand with sudden purpose. "You left this in Mr. Powell's car. He told me to bring it up to you."



Yvonne's eyes shrunk to slits,a cold rush of dread surging through her veins.



Buried in that bag were pregnancy supplements-the ones Spencer had given her! Had Julian seen them?Had he discovered she was carrying a child? By sending Paula back with the medicine, was he silently warning her-to deal with the pregnancy on her own?



Paula's brows knitted, her tone tinged with confusion."Mrs.Powell?"



Yvonne forced her lipsinto a rigid curve, though her jaw felt stiff. "Did he mention anything else?" she pressed,trying to sound unbothered.



Paula shook her head lightly, her brows knit in bewilderment. "No, nothing more."



Yvonne's pulse quickened, panic drumming in her ears as countless possibilities churned through her mind.She accepted the bag from Paula, her fingers trembling, the weight of it amplifying her dread. If Julian truly had no intention of accepting this child,she would vanish overseas without hesitation, cutting every trail so he could only chase shadows without ever finding her.



More than anything, she would shield the baby from harm-especially from Julian.



With that silent vow burning in her chest, she unfastened the bag. The instant her eyes fell on what lay inside, all her frantic thoughts froze solid.



She stared at the label with a flat expression, fingers brushing the cool surface as she muttered,"Vitamin C?"



The bag held nothing else-just a few identical vitamin C bottles clicking softly together.



The truth struck Yvonne at once-Spencer was behind this. Ever the cautious one, he had tucked her prenatal supplements into vitamin C bottles so Julian wouldn't suspect a thing, the disguise neat enough to pass any casual glance.



At that realization, she let out a long breath, the tension draining from her shoulders as fatigue and relief settled in equal measure.


Apparently,Julian hadn't found out after all! Before she could gather herself, a sharp knock rattled the door. Sebastian's voice filtered through, calm but formal. "Mrs. Powell, Ms. Adams is here to see you."

###Chapter 19 Provocation



Across the living room, Rita lounged on the sofa, idly lifting her hand to admire the glossy finish of her newly painted nails, her lips curved in smug satisfaction.



Yvonne made her way down the stairs with unhurried grace, dressed in soft, casual loungewear that still carried the air of elegance. Her expression was perfectly composed, the serene smile of a woman in command of her home.



"Ms. Adams, such an early visit," she remarked smoothly. "What business brings you here?"



Rita tilted her chin, and with Julian gone, the sugary facade evaporated. Her smile sharpened, her eyes flashing with malice as she delivered her words like a knife."I came to ask you to divorce Julian."


Yvonne's gaze cooled, a faint narrowing of her eyes betraying her irritation. A laugh almost escaped her-low,scornful, incredulous at the sheer gall.


Indeed, divorce was her purpose as well, but for a mistress to march into her house and demand it? That was goddamn outrageous. Holding to that thought, Yvonne's chin lifted, her voice edged with frost. "And if I don't agree? Ms Adams, stop deluding yourself and face the reality.Without my consent, a divorce will never happen. And as long as that stands, you'll always be nothing more than the pathetic other woman. And the other woman sure as hell doesn't get to talk to me that way."



Rita's jaw tightened, but a sly smile soon curved across her lips. Her voice carried a dangerous calm."It's you who should face the reality. The unloved wife is the real outsider, wouldn't you agree?"



Yvonne's gaze hardened into ice, yet Rita didn't flinch.With a spark of defiance, Rita leaned in slightly, her words deliberate. "In fact, there's another reason l came today... I know you're pregnant."


The words hit Yvonne like a lightning strike, and her hands curled into fists before she could stop herself.



Rita's smirk deepened as she pressed the blade in further. "I also know why you've kept your pregnancy from Julian-because you understand he doesn't love you, and he'd never want this child."



The most guarded secret in Yvonne's heart was dragged out and trampled by the woman who had stolen her husband's devotion. Shame cut through her so sharply she felt ice spreading through her veins. She forced her spine straight, lifting her chin to hold on to the lastfragile thread of composure, determined not to crumble in front of Rita.



But Rita's voice came again, merciless and taunting."On your third wedding anniversary, Julian was with me-that's the real reason he came home so late..."



"Shut your mouth!" Yvonne's shout cracked with fury though her trembling voice betrayed her, and the wave of nausea in her stomach surged violently. She couldn't let another word reach her ears.



Yet Rita pressed on, her voice sharp with triumph,"That night, he proposed to me. We spent the night together, and my child was conceived right then."



She studied Yvonne's face with undisguised delight,savoring the moment as the usually composed woman trembled on the edge of collapse.



Yvonne's eyes burned red, her body quivering as she clenched her teeth, dignity splintering under the weight of humiliation.



Nevertheless, she lifted her chin, forcing a brittle smile and carrying herself with the poise of the lady of the house. "So what?" she muttered evenly.



The unexpected response knocked Rita off balance for an instant. Yvonne's voice turned cool, almost scornful. "You clearly don't understand how high society works. Men often keep mistresses, even father children outside their marriage. But illegitimate children are never acknowledged. Do you honestly think Rodger, with his reputation for fairness and uncompromising principles,would ever recognize your child as one of his own?"



Rita's face tightened, her composure cracking, while Yvonne released a slow breath, her lips curving into a subtle, derisive smile.



"Don't fool yourself into thinking you could climb higher just because a man favors you. In this circle,affection never lasts. As long as I'm Julian's wife,don't even dream of getting your ass into the Powell family," Yvonne sneered.


Even with the satisfaction those words brought,no comfort followed. She bit back her tears with sheer determination.



Before Rita, her loss was undeniable, but surrendering in shame was more than she could endure.



Rita's features contorted with anger, but her eyes flicked to the sapphire bracelet glinting on Yvonne's wrist. A sudden laugh slipped from her lips, laced with feigned regret. "That bracelet is gorgeous. But l've never cared for blue. Honestly, knowing that something | dislike ended up on you is almost  comforting."



Yvonne's gaze snapped to Rita, disbelief flashing across her face. "What the hell are you getting at?!" 
###Chapter 20 Leave



Rita's eyes sparkled with smug delight as she regarded Yvonne, her expression laced with both pity and disdain. "This bracelet isn't just expensive-it's worth a million and carries deep meaning. Back when Julian refused his family's support when he studied abroad,he barely had enough to live on. But because I once mentioned I liked it, he worked half a year just to buy it for me. And that night, he proposed with this very bracelet..."



She paused deliberately, her voice dipping into a tone of arrogant complaint. "The design felt outdated,though. So I didn't take it."



Every syllable landed like a dull blade, slicing through the fragile scars of Yvonne's heart. Her face drained of color,her expression hollowing out as if all light had been extinguished from her eyes.



That bracelet-her first gift fromn Julian in three long years of marriage-now felt like a cruel reminder of everything she lacked.



She could still picture the surge of joy from that night,the way her heart had leapt when the bracelet had been placed in her hands.Now the truth cut like glass-it was nothing more than a cast-off trinket, something Julian had passed along without thought, while she had treasured it as if it were priceless.



Rita, her face alight with gloating pride, was about to press further when she caught the fiery redness clouding Yvonne's eyes. The sharp glare that followed froze her mid-word.



"Get the hell out of here!" Yvonne commanded, her voice trembling but laced with fury.



Rita knew she had struck deep enough. Any further and the situation might spiral beyond her control.Composure restored, she curved her lips into a taunting smile. "Think it over. I'll drop by another time."


Yvonne's composure shattered the moment Rita's haughty silhouette faded from the doorway. She yanked the bracelet from her wrist and flung it with all the force her trembling body could muster.



Dropping to her knees, she buried her face in her palms,sobs tearing free from her chest.



Rita's words echoed mercilessly in her mind. Julian had never loved her-clinging to this marriage only made her pitiful. If she ended it herself, perhaps she could salvage a shred of dignity. By the time evening shadows stretched across the house, Paula was tidying the living room and looked up to see Yvonne descending the stairs.


A suitcase rolled behind Yvonne; Snowy nestled quietly in her arms. Her wrist was bare, stripped of the bracelet she once wore like armor.


After three years of marriage, these few belongings were all she had left to carry away.



Paula froze in shock, not only at the sight of the suitcase but at the hollow look in Yvonne's face-puffy eyes, drained complexion, every trace of strength stripped away.


"Mrs. Powell, where are you going?" she blurted,hurrying toward Yvonne.



"I'm leaving this place," Yvonne answered evenly, her tone so calm it carried an air of finality.



The words hit Paula like a slap. She had suspected something earlier when she noticed the packing, but she never dreamed Yvonne would truly follow through.


"Shouldn't you at least tell Mr. Powell? He'll be devastated if he comes home and you're gone!" Paula pleaded, reaching out as if to physically stop her.


Shaken to the core, Paula's mind went blank-that was all she could think of. In her eyes, Yvonne's devotion to Julian ran too deep for her to mean it-this had to be a fit of anger, a wounded tantrum.Surely, once Julian returned and spoke to her, Yvonne would abandon such a reckless decision.



Yet Yvonne just lowered her voice, her words deliberate. "Just tell him I walked away by choice,and you couldn't change my mind. He won't blame you for it."



"That's not what I meant..." Paula grew flustered."There must be some misunderstanding between you and Mr. Powell. Please, wait until he comes back so you two can talk it out. Don't do something you'll regret!"



Yvonne's vision blurred, her eyes stinging with tears she refused to shed. Talk it out? That would only strip away the last of her pride. Her heart was already too fragile to endure another blow.



She drew in a shaky breath and forced a smile, though it trembled at the corners. "There's no need, Paula.I know you mean well. Thank you-for you and Sebastian both-for looking after me all these years.But..."



Her gaze flicked around the familiar hall before returning to Paula. "Soon, someone else will be running this household." With that, Yvonne spun on her heel and strode for the door, her decisiveness leaving Paula panicked and scrambling for words.



Just as her hand reached the knob, she hesitated.Without glancing back, her voice cut through the silence."By the way, when Julian comes home, tell him to sign the divorce papers. I'll deal with Rodger myself -he doesn't need to worry about that."



Meanwhile, at the Powell Group, in Julian's office,the quiet rustle of paper filled the room. He was bent over a contract when an inexplicable jolt shot through his chest, forcing his pen to pause. A sharp throb hammered at his temples, an unease he couldn't name coiling in his gut.


He leaned back in his chair, massaging his brow before fixing Morton with a searching look. "How's the assignment I gave you?"


Morton clasped his hands behind his back. "I already sent Mrs. Powell's medication to the hospital lab for analysis."



Julian gave a curt nod, but his phone buzzing across the desk pulled his attention away. Seeing Paula's name on the screen, his brows drew tight. The moment he answered, his face hardened.



On the other end, Paula's voice wavered, thick with tears. "Mr. Powell... it's about Mrs. Powell. She packed her things and left the house!"
###Chapter 21 Left Behind



The night was sharp with cold when Julian returned home, his expression as bleak as the air outside. Paula rose nervously from the couch, wringing her hands."What happened?" His low voice cut through the silence,weighted with unease.



Her eyes darted before she answered, "Ms. Adams stopped by this afternoon. She spoke with Mrs.Powell for a while, and then Mrs. Powell..." Her voice trailed off, avoiding the rest.



Paula didn't mention seeing Yvonne quietly packing that morning. In her heart, she blamed every crack in the marriage on that interloper, Rita, and prayed Julian would finally recognize it before it was too late.



Julian's brow knitted into a hard line the moment Rita's name entered the air. He pressed down the surge of anger roiling in his chest,pulled out his phone,and dialed her number.



On the other end, Rita's voice was light with surprise."Julian? Why are you calling at this hour? If you're free,why don't you come over and..."



His interruption was swift, his tone edged with ice. "Did you go see Yvonne today?" Rita hesitated, her lashes trembling as her voice broke into a pitiful murmur. "Did Yvonne say something to you? You know she can't stand me..."


Julian pressed his fingers hard against his temple, a dull throb building behind his eyes. "I want to know exactly what you told her. She's moved out."


For an instant, Rita's pupils lit up with secret triumph,but she quickly masked it, widening her eyes in mock disbelief. "Moved out? That's impossible... Julian, I only tried to explain what was between us so she wouldn't get the wrong idea. I never thought it would push her to this." Her voice wavered, each word trembling as if she were on the verge of tears.


Julian gave no reaction, his expression unreadable.After a long silence, he finally spoke, his tone flat and stripped of warmth. "I see."


He ended the call without waiting for her reply, then stood rooted to the spot, his gaze distant, his thoughts tangled in the heavy quiet of the room.


Only now did it hit him-Yvonne hadn't been bluffing this time. Her phone had been powered off, and even after he sent Morton to check the villa's surveillance,not a single camera had caught her leaving.


The woman who had once clung to him so desperately, enduring humiliation just to stay by his side, had now chosen to disappear without a trace.


After what felt like an endless stretch of emptiness,he dragged his weary body back into the bedroom they used to share.


Paula had said Yvonne left with nothing more than a suitcase and the puppy, yet as Julian scanned the space, it felt stripped bare. Every trace of her-her perfume, her books, the little touches she'd left behind-was gone, as though she had never lived there at all.


A dull, inexplicable ache settled in his chest. He told himself it was nothing more than anger at her sudden vanishing act, irritation at the thought of Rodger's fury once he found out, and the bitter hatred of watching everything slip from his control.


Julian's gaze landed on the bedside table, where something unfamiliar caught his eye. A jolt ran through him, and he crossed the room in long strides.Resting there was a freshly printed divorce agreement -and beside it, a blue diamond bracelet.



The sight struck him like a blow. He recognized the piece instantly. It was the bracelet he had once given Yvonne,the one she had cherished so much that it never left her wrist.



Yet now, among all the belongings she had taken, this was the one thing she had deliberately left behind.


The realization hollowed his chest. His expression hardened as he closed his fingers around the cool gemstone, clenching it so tightly his knuckles whitened.



Far away in a hotel room, Yvonne slipped off her mask and let herself sink into the sofa.A long,weary breath escaped her lips as her gaze drifted upward,unfocused, to the ceiling.



For the first time, it sank in-she had truly walked away from Julian. She knew she might cross paths with countless people in the years ahead. But deep down, she also knew there would never again be someone she loved with the same fierce devotion she had once given to him.



Yvonne lifted her hand to block the light, a quiet laugh slipping from her lips as she forced herself back into the present.



Her world couldn't keep circling around love. Walking away from Julian meant carving out a new beginning,not drowning in sorrow.



With that reminder, she drew in a steady breath,steadied her emotions, and slid her laptop onto her knees to check her inbox.


 
A week earlier, she had already started emailing her resume to directors and producers she once collaborated with, hoping someone would offer her another chance.



Long before her life got tangled with Julian's, she had been the star student at Kumvine Film Academy, the one everyone admired. Straight out of graduation,she landed a role as an assistant director in an international film directed by the world-renowned Vivian Oliver.



Back then, everyone had believed she was destined to become the brightest new director of her generation.Yet in the end, she had abandoned it all to step into the quiet, confining life of a housewife.


The more she thought about it, the more she loathed how foolish she'd once been.



The barren inbox glared back at her, a cruel reminder of how far she had fallen. Yvonne's fingers hovered stiffly over the keyboard, her chest heavy with discouragement.



Three years earlier, offers had poured in-scripts from acclaimed directors, invitations she had once taken for granted. Yet now, despite sending her resume everywhere she could, not a single reply came back.



Still, Yvonne refused to surrender. She had braced herself for this silence. Three years away from the  spotlight was a lifetime in the cutthroat world of entertainment, and she knew the only way forward was to start again from the ground up.



So she pressed on, sending application after application, her determination flickering like a stubborn flame. Just as despair threatened to swallow her, a sharp ding pierced the stillness-a long-awaited email had finally arrived.
###Chapter 22 Give Up



The reply in Yvonne's inbox carried the logo of a rising force in the industry-TR Entertainment.



She quickly dug into their background and was startled to learn they had been founded only three years earlier.



Despite their short history, the company's expansion had been explosive, putting them shoulder to shoulder with older,well-established media giants.



Countless celebrities had ridden TR Entertainment's wave to stardom, though the whispers about their contracts painted a harsh picture-crippling penalties for breach, but rewards so dazzling that few dared to walk away.



Out of all the resumes she had scattered into the void without a single reply, this was the only company that called back. Yvonne wasn't sure whether to chalk it up to luck or fate.



After wrestling with her doubts, she steeled herself.This chance might never come again.


Yes, the standards were notoriously high, but the resources they provided could relaunch her career and,  more importantly, help her cut ties with Julian once and for all.



Yvonne fired off her acceptance for the interview and immediately scoured every corner of the internet for information about the company.



By nine o'clock the next morning, she arrived at TR Entertainment's headquarters. A sleek black trench coat draped over her frame, sunglasses covering her eyes, she cut a sharp figure.



The reception area overflowed with nervous faces,each one likely vying for the same opportunity.Confidence carried her most of the way, yet a twinge of unease crept in-she had been gone from the spotlight for far too long.



Pulling out her documents to review, she was interrupted by a sudden swell of chatter that swept through the waiting area.


A woman's squeal pierced the noise. "Oh my God,he's gorgeous!"



A ripple of confusion crossed Yvonne's face as she lifted her gaze. Julian strode into the room in a perfectly cut suit, his expression sharp and unyielding,with a wall of bodyguards closing in around him.



His eyes found hers without hesitation, locking onto her like a force she couldn't break away from. The noise in the waiting room dissolved into silence.Only the pounding of her own heartbeat filled her ears, and all she could see was the man closing the distance between them.



Julian? Why here, of all places?



Her body refused to move, her fingers tightening around the stack of documents as though they could anchor her in place.



Julian's eyes brushed over her briefly, then slid away as if she were no more than a stranger. He continued down the hall without hesitation, not sparing her a second look.



An emptiness swept through Yvonne, a sting that settled deep in her chest.


All around her, the waiting area erupted with chatter,voices laced with awe and excitement.


"That was Julian, wasn't it? The CEO of the Powell Group.What on earth is he doing here? He's unbelievably handsome!"



"I heard Powell Group just signed a partnership with TR Entertainment. He's not only gorgeous, but he's also powerful and rich. His wife must be the luckiest woman alive."
"Totally! Everyone says he worships her. He shields her from the press, and nobody's ever even seen her photo. That's what true love looks like. I'd give anything to marry someone like him."



The crowd buzzed with admiration, painting a picture of perfection, never realizing the woman they envied was sitting in their midst, silently choking on bitterness.



Yvonne hadn't expected the illusion to run so deep.Julian's PR machine had worked wonders, selling the world a love story that didn't exist.



In reality,his silence about her wasn't devotion-it was distance. He never let her stand beside him where the world could see.



Her eyes lingered on the interview room door, and a heavy breath slipped past her lips.



The moment she remembered Julian's stake in this company, her resolve faltered. She hadn't come searching for another chain. She wanted distance,a clean break, and working here would only keep her tethered to him.



That truth settled heavily on her shoulders, and she made up her mind. This opportunity wasn't hers to take.


 
Pushing herself to her feet, Yvonne prepared to leave it all behind. The door to the interview room swung open just then, and an HR staff member stepped into the waiting area,voice ringing clear. "Ms. Yvonne Ellis?Please come in for your interview."
###Chapter 23 Interview



Yvonne froze in place, trapped in a moment that felt almost suffocating.



The HR staff's voice cut through the silence again, and the room stirred. Several candidates exchanged puzzled looks, whispering under their breath-who would walk away from an interview at TR Entertainment? It seemed utterly absurd.



Among them, Yvonne's urge to retreat stood out the most, drawing every pair of eyes toward her hesitant figure.



"Are you Yvonne Ellis?" the staff asked pointedly.



Yvonne managed an awkward smile, forced herself to turn around, and gave a small nod.



"Good,come on in. People are waiting," the staff urged,gesturing toward the door.



With those words, the staff slipped back into the interview room, leaving Yvonne little choice but to trail after her, every step heavy with reluctance.



She resolved to simply go through the motions.Missing out on the selection wouldn't trouble her in the slightest.



However,fate, it seemed, had a cruel sense of humor.



Awkward and uneasy, she stepped into the room-only to see Julian seated at the center of the panel,his posture commanding, his presence radiating authority as though he owned the place.



What on earth was he doing here? A man perpetually buried in work now sitting as an interviewer?



A chill prickled along her scalp. Instinctively, she turned on her heel to retreat, but his voice cut across the room,halting her.



"Let's get on with the interview." He delivered the words with quiet detachment, the way one might speak to an outsider.


Yvonne bit her lip before turning sharply on her heel,forcing her features into calm dignity as she dipped into a graceful bow before the line of interviewers."Nice to meet you all. I'm Yvonne Ellis."



Since Julian could act detached, treating her as if they were strangers, she resolved to mirror that same composure.



The panel acknowledged her with polite nods and motioned for her to take a seat. One interviewer scanned her resume, then lifted his gaze. "Ms. Ellis, your record shows you graduated from a prestigious university and even directed several short films that won awards during your studies. Could you explain the three-year gap in your otherwise impressive career?"



Julian's hand stilled for an instant at the question,though he said nothing. He picked up her resume,flipping through the pages as if only half-interested.



Yvonne's throat tightened. Her mind drifted unwillingly to the night before graduation-the moment she brushed off every persuasion from teachers and friends to follow her own stubborn choice. That choice had been Julian.



After a long pause, she spoke, her tone carrying a cool steadiness tinged with self-mockery. "I ggot married and spent the last three years as a housewife."



The interviewers exchanged startled glances, though Julian only narrowed his eyes, his expression giving nothing away.



That interviewer pressed on, "Considering you're married now,what made you decide to return to work?"



Yvonne flicked her gaze toward Julian, catching his detached demeanor, and a wicked impulse rose in her chest. With a playful smile, she replied, "Well, my husband dóesn't really earn enough to support us, so I thought I'd better help out." A chill radiated across the table as Julian's eyes cut toward her, sharp enough to slice through her bravado.The air seemed to freeze under the weight of his glare,and Yvonne's daring smile crumbled, leaving her tense and flustered.



The questions that followed were routine and professional, and though Julian's piercing stare lingered like ice, Yvonne managed to respond with poise. After a brief discussion, the panel thanked her politely and asked her to await further notice.



Her chest tightened. She knew too well that "further notice" usually meant rejection. She had braced herself for disappointment, but the sting still landed.



Even so, what weighed heavier was the need to escape Julian's suffocating presence.



Saying nothing more, she rose, bowed gracefully to the panel, and hurried from the room. Her heels clicked quickly across the floor as she made straight for the elevator.



Relief flickered when the doors slid open at her arrival.She reached for them,ready to step inside-only for a strong hand to seize her arm and pull her back.



Whipping around in anger, she froze when her gaze collided with Julian's, her fury draining away beneath the force of his eyes.
###Chapter 24 Passed



Julian's long arms caged Yvonne against the wvall,his frame leaning in until the air between them crackled.A dangerous gleam lit his eyes as he cornered her.



A low laugh escaped him-mocking, edged with fury.He caught her chin in his hand, tilting her face upward so she couldn't look away. "Your husband doesn't really earn enough to support you, huh? So you thought you'd better get yourself a job, is that it?"


Her gaze faltered, slipping downward, but his teeth clenched as his voice hardened. "In all these three years, did I ever once leave you without money?You're getting outrageously bold, Yvonne. Why not go all the way and declare me dead?"



Summoning what remained of her pride, Yvonne lifted her chin, eyes blazing with defiance. "Throughout these years we've been bound by marriage, you've been no different than a dead man."



Julian's fury burned in his eyes as he closed the space between them, their foreheads nearly colliding, the heat of his breath mixing with hers in a charged,suffocating closeness.



Though his face hovered just inches away,his tone was like a blade dipped in ice. "You really enjoy testing my limits, don't you? Tell me-what punishment do you deserve?"


The depth of his voice carried a dangerous pull,chilling yet hypnotic, as if every word was a trap.


A tremor ran through Yvonne's body; instinct screamed at her to flee. She shifted, trying to slip past him, but his sudden movement cut off all escape.



His mouth crashed down on hers without warning.The kiss was brutal and consuming, stripping her of breath as tears stung the corners of her eyes.


She beat against his arms in a futile struggle, but his iron grip never wavered, forcing her helplessly into surrender.



At that moment,footsteps echoed down the corridor,snapping Yvonne back to her senses. Panic shot through her-if anyone saw them like this, it would be disastrous. Instinctively, she prepared to bite him,her old method of escape, but Julian released her first, as though he had predicted her move.



She slumped against the wall, chest rising and falling,her glare sharp with frustration.


He showed no reaction, only leaning closer, his expression unreadable. Startled, she tensed and tried to retreat, but his voice, low and icy, brushed against her ear. "Since you don't want the life of a wealthy wife, I'll make sure you get your wish."


Her heart lurched at those words. Before she could ask what he meant, Julian had already turned away,his indifference cutting sharper than his kiss.


Her lips still burned from the rough press of his mouth.She touched them gingerly, the lingering sting blending with the ache that spread through her chest.


She gathered what composure she could, turned on her heel, and headed back to the hotel to pack.


The place had always been just a temporary stop. Now that the lease paperwork for her new apartment was finalized,she could finally move in that very day.


Her luggage was light, but even the small task of relocating was enough to drown out the sour aftertaste of the interview. By the time everything was in order and she had settled into the new space,several days had slipped past.


One afternoon, freshly washed and with damp hair brushing her shoulders, Yvonne curled onto the sofa with Snowy nestled in her arms. She opened her laptop and resumed the relentless search for a job.



TR Entertainment no longer mattered to her;regardless of the outcome, she had no intention of setting foot in that company again. What she needed  were fresh opportunities.


This time, her inbox didn't remain empty. Replies arrived quickly from every company she reached out to-yet each sounded suspiciously alike. They praised her talent, called her impressive, but ended with the same polished refusal: she wasn't a suitable fit.


One instance could have been dismissed as coincidence, but the same rejection from every company reeked of deliberate sabotage. Yvonne sat up abruptly, her brows knitting together, fury simmering in her chest.


This had Julian's fingerprints all over it-his childish way of proving he meant what he'd threatened that morning.How much pettier could this bastard get?


Seething,she snatched up her phone,ready to unleash her anger on him. Before she could dial, however,a fresh chime from her inbox pulled her attention back to the screen.



It was an email from TR Entertainment. Just one short line glowed on the display. "Congratulations, you have passed the interview."
###Chapter 25 Intruder



Yvonne's lips curved in a bitter smile as she stared at the email. Julian had left her no exit, deliberately hemming her in until she had no choice but to crawvl to TR Entertainment.



A sharp, derisive snort escaped her. Rolling onto her side, she snatched up her phone, unblocked Julian's number, and jabbed the call button.



The line buzzed in long,hollow tones before cutting off without an answer. Of course-this was him retaliating.



Her jaw tightened. Instead of calling again, she flicked through her contacts and landed on Morton.



The moment he picked up, Yvonne's voice was rigid,brimming with rage. "What the hell is Julian playing at?Did he tell those companies to turn me down?"



Morton hesitated, his tone careful. "Mrs. Powell...I strongly suggest you don't confront Mr. Powell directly. The résumés you sent-they all ended up back in my hands."


Yvonne's blood boiled, her grip on the phone turning white-knuckled."Where the fuck is Julian? Put him on. I want him to answer me right now!"


Morton cleared his throat before answering, "I was about to tell you-Mr. Powell's at the hospital."


Yvonne halted in shock, her eyes widening."What?Why is he in the hospital?"


The thought of the man who always seemed sO vigorous suddenly collapsing seemed ridiculous. Then,an unsettling guess came to her mind.



Morton's voice carried through the line, heavy with gravity. "Rodger was rushed into the emergency room.He fell seriously ill without warning."



Her phone slipped from her trembling fingers,clattering loudly against the floor. Heart pounding, she snatched it up again, fighting to steady her breath."Which hospital?" she demanded, her voice shaky but determined.



Morton's voice came steady through the phone. "I've already sent you the address."



Yvonne ended the call without another word and darted out of the apartment.



Inside the cab speeding toward the hospital, she clasped her hands tightly together, whispering silent prayers for Rodger's safety For three long years, Rodger had been her shield and her comfort. In her heart, he was no less than a real grandfather.



When the taxi stopped at Kumvine Hospital, she hurried inside, following the directions Morton had forwarded. The scent of disinfectant clung to the VIP wing as she made her way down the hushed corridor.She reached the room at last. Just as her palm touched the handle, the sound of laughter spilled out through the narrow gap in the door.



Yvonne froze, peering through the crack. Inside, Rita stood beside Julian at the bedside, her words drawing a hearty laugh from Rodger. Julian's lips curved into the faintest of smiles.



The sight struck Yvonne like a blade. They looked like a picture-perfect couple, standing shoulder to shoulder as if they were the ones keeping vigil for family.



She froze at the doorway, feeling like an intruder who didn't belong. Hovering there, she wavered, unsure if she should step in or retreat.



She knew the moment she entered, the air would tighten with awkwardness. Perhaps it would've been better to stay away.


Her throat burned as teas pricked her eyes. She  loosened her hand from the doorknob, ready to slip away unnoticed.



But then Rodger spotted her and called out cheerfully,"Yvonne, come inside!"



All three heads turned at once. As expected, Julian's faint smile evaporated, replaced by his signature frost His brows knitted, his gaze hardening the moment it landed on her.



So he really couldn't stand the sight of her? The realization stabbed through her chest. Still, she couldn't turn down Rodger's invitation. Forcing a strained smile,she stepped into the room.


"Rodger, how are you? What happened to make you fall ill so suddenly?" she inquired, her concern soft but genuine.



Rodger flicked his wrist carelessly, his tone light. "It's nothing serious, just an old ailment. No need to fuss."



Rita leaned in with a gentle smile, her voice sweet."Yvonne, don't worry. I already gave Rodger the special prescription Dr. Carter developed. It's been working wonders."



Yvonne's chest tightened. Rita wasn't simply reassuring ler-she was showing off. Pregnant with Julian's child and now posing as Rodger's savior, it was only a matter of time before Rita pushed her aside and took her place as Julian's wife.



Determined not to reveal her unease, Yvonne curved her lips into a polite smile. "Thank you, Ms. Adams."



She turned to Julian, her emotions surging, though she hid every flicker of it for Rodger's sake. Her tone softened. "Honey, can we talk for a moment?"


Julian's gaze lifted toward her, a faint nod just beginning-when Rita suddenly pressed a hand to her temple and stumbled straight into his arms.



"Julian... I feel so dizzy," she murmured weakly,her voice dripping with fragility.
###Chapter 26 A Reason



Rita clutched her forehead, leaning into Julian's arms and murmuring about dizziness before coaxing him to take her home. The act left Yvonne and Rodger alone in the hospital room.


Yvonne's smile dissolved, her lips unable to shape even a polite curve. Rita's little performances were always so transparent, and she couldn't believe Julian didn't see through them.


Still, no matter how many chances life gave him,he would crawl back to Rita and cast her off like trash.


The sting in her eyes warned of tears, though she forced them back. She didn't want to reveal too much weakness before Rodger, but he was a sharp man.


His gaze lingered on her, gentle yet probing. "Yvonne,did you and Julian get into a fight?" he asked softly.


Her head moved in a quick denial, but his disapproval was obvious. "Trying to fool me again? Look at you-you're pale, thinner than before. Tell me the truth, is that scoundrel giving you a hard time?"


Instinctively, her fingers brushed her own cheek,realizing the hollowness there. Since the pregnancy, food had lost its appeal, and restless nights had carved shadows under her eyes. With everything pressing down on her, of course she looked completely wrecked.



But what would be the point of confiding in Rodger?Could he make Julian stay, or force him to care? The answer was already written in her heart.



Yvonne cast a longing glance toward the doorway,knowingthat if Rodger tried to pressure Julian on her behalf, it would only drive him further away and crush any hope of a willing divorce.



Catching the direction of her gaze, Rodger appeared to realize what was happening. "Is this about Rita?"



She didn't respond, and he let out a slow sigh."Yvonne, I know you're upset that Rita came back and reunited with Julian. But trust me-there's no future for the two of them."



His expression darkened as old memories stirred."Everyone in the Powell family carries their pride in their bones. None of us would ever fall for someone who betrayed us before."



Her brows lifted slightly as she pressed, "Rita betrayed Julian?"



Until now, she had only heard they were an inseparable pair abroad. She had assumed Julian  returned home because Rodger forced him into marriage, which explained his disdain for her. She never imagined there was more behind their breakup.



Rodger gave a firm nod, cleared his throat,and seemed ready to reveal the truth-when the hospital door swung open and Julian strode back inside,catching them both off guard.



Julian's sudden move caught Yvonne off guard,especially wwhen his arm slipped casually over her shoulder as though it belonged there.



"Grandpa, we'll head home now," he said lightly,addressing Rodger.



Rodger's gaze flickered nervously before he gave a stiff nod.



Yvonne shifted uneasily under Julian's hold and queried in a low tone, "Didn't you send Rita back?"



"I waved a taxi over for her," he replied, narrowing his eyes at her. "Didn't you want to talk to me about something?"



Flustered, Yvonne turned her face aside. Catching the exchange, Rodger's voice cut in, firm with reproach,"You heartless brat, treat Yvonne properly! Money isn't everything-start paying more attention to your wife!" Julian, ever the obedient grandson in front of Rodger,inclined his head with practiced submission. "Alright,Grandpa.I understand."


Rodger gave a polite wave of dismissal. "Alright then,the two of you head home. I need some rest."


With no way to refuse, Yvonne walked out beside Julian.



Downstairs at the hospital entrance, his hand remained firmly clasped around hers. She finally wrenched free,her tone sharp and cold. "Rodger isn't here. You don't need to keep pretending anymore."


Julian's gaze flicked to her baggy clothes, the result of her weight loss. A shadow crossed his eyes before he sneered disdainfully, "Seems like life's been hell for you since you walked away from me."


Rage exploded in her chest. How dared he throw such a thing back at her?



"AlL 'thanks' to you!" Her eyes blazed with fury as she fixed him with a hard glare.


Julian studied her pale but unyielding face in silence for a beat, then spoke abruptly. "Give me a reason."


She froze, caught off guard. He pressed on, voice low and edged, "Give me one reason strong enough to make me believe you truly want this divorce."
###Chapter 27 Two Conditions
The hospital entrance lay eerily quiet beneath the weight of midnight, the silence broken only by the unspoken tension between Julian and Yvonne as they faced one another.


At last, Yvonne dropped her gaze, unable to hold his eyes any longer.


A storm raged inside her chest, sharp and relentless,begging for release. She could have screamed, could have wept like a woman shattered by love.


But that would strip her of the little dignity she had left, and it was for dignity's sake that she had chosen divorce in the first place.



Drawing in a slow breath, she curved her lips into a brittle smile. Her tone came out feather-light,though her heart bled beneath it. "Because I don't love you anymore. I'm exhausted,Julian."



The coldness in his face deepened,his jaw tightening until his teeth ground together. "I want a real reason."


"It is. What's wrong? Do you really believe you're so irresistible that I'm doomed to love you until the day I die? That I should cling to a marriage that feels like  nothing but emptiness?"



Her defiance twisted something inside him, unearthing the shadow of Spencer in his mind.



Had she reached for someone else just to escape the emptiness?



Fury seared through Julian at the thought, burning away every trace of composure. A bitter laugh slipped from his throat. "So be it. I'll give you what you want.In the end, this was always just business. Anyone can fill the role of my wife."


The words sliced into her, draining the color from her face,though the night mercifully hid it.



How pathetic she must have seemed-fighting for freedom, only to find her heart splintering when he gave it to her.



Her chest felt hollow, like a barren wasteland where nothing living could survive, yet she forced herself to stand tall.



With a fragile smile, Yvonne answered softly, "Alright then, Mr. Powell. Tell me when you'd like to sign the papers."


Julian's stare bored into her, dark and unreadable, as though a storm churned behind his eyes. Then,just as quickly, the intensity vanished. He looked away with chilling calm. "Two conditions. First, the divorce waits until my grandfather regains his health."


Yvonne tilted her head in agreement. Rodger's fragile state couldn't endure such a blow, and she had already intended to shield him from the truth until he recovered.



"Second..." Julian's gaze slid back to her, his voice deliberate and heavy. "You sign with TR Entertainment and make five million within three months."



Her breath caught, shock flashing across her face."Five million? In only three months? That's impossible!"



A sharp laugh escaped him, dripping with disdain."Impossible? If you can't even manage that, what right do you have to walk away from the Powell family?"


Her throat tightened, words failing her. The arrogance in his tone stung, yet part of her knew he wasn't exaggerating. In the Powell household, five million was less than her usual monthly allowance.


Still, the demand wasn't about money. Hewas setting the bar high on purpose, daring her to fail. Withouthis backing, where could she find such resources, such connections? "If you can't deliver, then don't waste your time dreaming..." His words drifted out casually, meant to dismiss her entirely.



That was the spark that lit her fire. Straightening her spine, Yvonne cut him off, her voice steady and sharp."Fine. I'll do it. But remember this, Mr. Powell-if I succeed, you don't get to take your promise back."



His eyes narrowed, a cold smirk tugging at his lips."Don't worry. I won't."



He missed the subtle tremor in her stance, the way her body seemed ready to give out.



Pressing a hand to her temple, Yvonne fought against a sudden wave of dizziness. Two days without proper sleep and meals, and the crushing weight of their confrontation had left her on the edge of collapse.



Determined not to let Julian glimpse her weakness,Yvonne pivoted on her heel, intent on walking away.



The moment she moved, however, a piercing hum filled her head, her sight wavered, and her body lurched to the side.



Before the ground could rise up to meet her, strong arms caught her mid-fall, pulling her against a chest that carried the steady, grounding scent of wood and earth.
###Chapter 28 Fever



Julian's palm pressed against Yvonne's forehead, the warmth of his hand at odds with the irritation in his tone. "You're burning up. Do you have a fever?"



Before she could even form a reply, her body lifted off the ground. A startled gasp slipped from her lips as she instinctively clung to his neck to keep from falling. Her mind swam in a fog, and it took long moments before she pieced together what was happening



No wonder the wvorld had felt so heavy all day. She had chalked it up to stress, but now the truth was undeniable-she was feverish.



Without pause, Julian adjusted his hold and strode toward the hospital doors. "You need a doctor. I'm taking you for a check-up."


Her hazy thoughts sharpened in an instant, panic rushing in. If she went through an examination, he might uncover the pregnancy she had worked so hard to hide.



Desperation fueled her resistance. She pushed against him, her voice rising. "No! I don't need a check-up. I'm fine.Put me down, Julian. I just want to go home!"
Julian's sigh came out heavy with impatience."Yvonne,stop being childish. Only kids throw tantrums about seeing a doctor when they're sick."


His grip didn't falter; her struggles were no match for his strength.



Illness made her defenses crumble, and in that vulnerable moment, frustration spilled over. Her eyes shimmered, her voice breaking. "I don't want your help!We've been married three years, and not once have you cared when I was sick. Don't start pretending now."



Her tears stunned him, rooting him in place. For the first time, the sight of her hurt carved through his usual composure.


Something shifted in his expression as he softened."Alright... if you don't want to see a doctor, then we won't. I'll take you home instead."


Relief washed over Yvonne like a heavy burden finally cast aside, and the fever's grip soon pulled her under.Her breathing steadied as she slipped into sleep,cradled in his arms.



Julian lingered, studying her face in silence, before shifting and carrying her toward the waiting car.


He lowered her carefully into the passenger seat,leaning close as he drew the seatbelt across her chest. Just as the buckle clicked, she stirred in her sleep, her lips brushing faintly against his cheek. Her voice,fragile and pleading, broke through the quiet.


"Julian... please, don't hurt our..."



His eyes froze on her face, his expression unreadable as the words lingered in the air.



The engine came alive, and the car rolled onto the open road.



If Yvonne had been awake, she would have noticed immediately that he wasn't driving toward his estate.Instead, he was heading straight for her own apartment-a place she had never once told him about.



When they arrived, Julian lifted her with surprising gentleness and carried her inside. The moment her back met the bed, Yvonne's lashes fluttered. As the familiar walls came into focus, she jolted fully awake.



Her brows knit, voice edged with suspicion."How do you know where I live? And how did you get in? Have you been spying on me?"



Julian's tone remained calm, unshaken. "This apartment belongs to the Powell Group. I've known about it sinte the day you moved in."



He set a glass of water on the nightstand, placing a tablet beside it. "If you won't let a doctor check you,then at least take this."



Yvonne's hand instinctively moved to her stomach,her eyes flickering with unease. The reminder cut through her haze-pregnant women couldn't take medicine so casually.



Yvonne forced a smile, her voice light but strained."I'm already feeling better. There's no need for medicine."



Julian's brows knitted as he stepped in, lifting his hand to check her temperature.



Annoyed, she slapped it away, only to hear his cold laugh. "You're burning up, and you expect me to believe you're fine?"



Her jaw tightened, but no argument came. Instead, she turned her face aside stubbornly. "I said I'm not taking it,and I won't."



Silence stretched between them. For once,Julian didn't press, and that alone startled her enough to glance back at him. Before she could speak, a sudden coolness spread across her forehead.



Startled, she reached up, but his hand caught hers and held it firmby.



"Don't move. It's just a cooling patch. If you refuse medicine, then this will have to do," he explained.



Yvonne's eyes widened, disbelief flickering in them.Since when did Julian show patience, let alone compromise?



He smoothed the patch into place, then lifted his gaze to hers. Slowly, he leaned closer, his breath brushing her skin.



"Won't see a doctor, won't take medicine," he murmured, his voice low and probing. "Tell me,Yvonne-what exactly are you so afraid of?" ###Chapter 29 Deserved



A shiver coursed through Yvonne, her thoughts scattering into silence.



Julian tilted her chin upward, his gaze sharp. "Maybe I should summon a doctor right now and uncover exactly what you're hiding."



Her breath steadied as she forced herself to regain control. Gently brushing his hand away, she answered evenly, "You've barely been home these past three years, so you wouldn't know. I once had a traumatic accident at a hospital. Ever since, I can't stand the idea of medical treatment."



The crease in Julian's brow deepened-he hadn't known that.



"But since you insist, I'll see a doctor," Yvonne continued, her voice calm, decisive. "I have one I trust.I'Ll call him here."



For a moment, Julian hesitated. Then he gave a curt nod, unwilling to push further. Deep down, guilt gnawed at him-three years of neglect had left him little ground to argue.



Yvonne pulled out her phone, her tone softening as she dialed. "Spencer, I'm suffering a fever. Do you have time to come over?"



Julian's head snapped up, eyes darkening as her words sank in. He swallowed the anger rising in his throat,his expression tightening. He should have known-of course she would call Spencer. Who else could she lean on?



Barely ten minutes passed before the doorbell rang.Julian's face soured as he strode to open the door.



Standing in the hall was Spencer, crisp in a tailored suit despite the late hour, gold-rimmed glasses glinting beneath the light. To Julian, he looked like a showy peacock, smug and shameless, circling what wasn't his.



A cold laugh escaped Julian, ready to spill venom, but Spencer swept past him without a glance, heading straight for Yvonne.



"Yvonne,how did you end up with such a high fever?"Spencer's voice softened with concern as he bent toward her. "Is it because you've been living alone with no one to look after you? Do you want to move in with me instead?"



Julian shoved the door closed, the echoing slam reverberating through the apartment-a sharp reminder that his presence loomed over them both. Neither Yvonne nor Spencer flinched. Their silence carried the weight of unspoken agreement: Julian didn't matter in this moment.


Her voice, soft and steady, broke the air. "Not that bad.Thank you for worrying about me."



Spencer only shook his head,already pulling open his medical kit. With calm precision, he began checking her over, his focus entirely on Yvonne, as though Julian were nothing more than a shadow in the corner.



Hours crept by. At last, Yvonne swallowed the medicine Spencer prescribed and slipped into a deep,fevered sleep.



When the two men stepped out of her room, Julian's gaze hardened into ice. "The examination is finished.Dr.Patel,you can leave now."



Spencer met his stare directly, refusing to yield."Leave? This isn't your place, Julian. This is Yvonne's apartment. As her friend, it's only natural I stay and look after her. The real question is-what about you?She doesn't seem so eager to have you here, does she?"



A sneer twisted Julian's mouth. "You seem to forget she's my wife. I don't need permission to be in her home. Tell me, Dr. Briggs-the Briggs Group is up for that outstanding-enterprise award this year, isn't it?What would your grandfather think if he learned you spent the night at another man's wife's apartment?"


Spencer's jaw clenched, fury flashing in his eyes. "If you were half the man you claim to be, you'd stop chaining Yvonne to a life that only hurts her. Husband or not, you've given her nothing. You don't deserve her."



Julian's retort came like a whip crack. "Whether I deserve her or not isn't your decision. Until the day l sign those divorce papers, she is still my wife!"



The air thickened, their locked glares sparking with hostility. Then, breaking the moment, Spencer's phone buzzed. One glance at the screen altered his expression. He cast Julian a sharp look, then turned away to answer the call.


After a moment, Spencer ended the call with a hardened expression, slipping his phone into his pocket before fixing Julian with a stern look. "I left some light food for Yvonne. When she wakes up,make sure she eats it."



He started toward the door but paused halfway,glancing back over his shoulder. "She deserves to be looked after-don't forget that."



Julian answered with a derisive snort, bristling at the audacity. To him, Spencer was nothing more than an intruder with no right to lecture him about his own wife.



The door clicked shut behind Spencer, leaving the apartment wrapped in silence. Julian strode back into the bedroom, his gaze landing on the thermos set neatly on the bedside table. A cold laugh escaped his lips. Without hesitation, he scooped it up and tossed it straight into the trash.
###Chapter 30 Have You Really Fallen For Spencer
By the time morning light seeped through the curtains,Yvonne woke with a hollow ache in her stomach.



The faint,soothing aroma of breakfast drifted in from outside, and her belly gave a loud, needy growl



Who on earth would be making breakfast in her home?



Baffled, she pushed herself upright, only to feel something cool and damp stuck to her forehead.Peeling it away, she discovered it was a fever patch.



The fragments of last night replayed in her mind, and her breath hitched. Could Julian be the one moving about outside?



It couldn't be. She brushed the thought aside at once Julian would never spend the whole night watching over her. That left only one possibility:Spencer.



Kicking off the blanket, Yvonne swung her legs out of bed. The fever had broken,yet her limbs still trembled with weakness, and the room tilted faintly as she stood.



"Snowy?" she rasped, calling for her little puppy, her  voice rough from sleep and illness.



Accustomed to solitude, she never noticed how her loose pajamas slipped off one shoulder, baring the pale curve of her delicate skin.



When she stepped into the living room,Julian lifted his eyes from the newspaper at the dining table. The unexpected glimpse of her bare shoulder left him momentarily arrested, his gaze darkening as if shadowed by something unspoken.



Startled, Yvonne probed sharply, "What on earth are you still doing here?"



The chill in his expression made her regret it instantly.She forced a small, apologetic smile, trying to soften her words.



As she moved closer, she spotted Snowy nestled comfortably in his lap, happily rubbing its little head against him.



What a traitorous puppy! What tricks had Julian pulled to sway its affection?


Bitterness clawed its way up her chest. She pursed her lips in a small pout, then shifted her gaze toward the dining table-only to freeze in surprise at what she saw



Steam curled from the glass of milk, accompanied by toasts and a fried egg. Feeling quietly moved, Yvonne slid into a chair. After a beat of hesitation, she softened her voice. "About last night... thank you."



Julian's tone was clipped. "I'm not the doctor. What's there to thank me for?"



The sharp edge in his words puzzled her. She sensed the irritation simmering underneath but couldn't fathom its cause. Deciding not to spoil the fragile warmth between them, she forced a small, easy smile."All the same... thank you."



For a moment he froze, eyes flicking away as though unsure how to respond. "Eat it before it cools."



She gave a subtle nod and picked up a slice with a faint smile. "Where did you get this? It actually looks pretty good."



Julian arched a brow, lips pressed in silence, though his gaze slipped back to her with a flicker of restless expectation.



Yvonne dismissed the fleeting thought as if it were just her imagination and lifted the milk for a sip.



Right then, Julían's voice cut through the quiet."Have you really fallen for Spencer?"



His voice betrayed a simmering frustration he couldn't  hide.



The sudden question caught her mid-sip. Her eyes went wide, and she choked, coughing hard.



Still sputtering, she stared at him in shock. "What did you just say?"


Julian pressed his lips into a hard line and turned away."Forget it." His cold gaze flickered with a flash of regret before he let the silence settle between them.



Yvonne's gaze flickered, deciding not to pursue the matter any further. She dabbed at her lips with a napkin, then frowned and muttered, "Looks good but tastes bad. It is toasted too much."



Julian stiffened, his fist tightening at his side as he instinctively hid the burn on his palm.



He hated how pathetically ridiculous he was acting,baffled by himself-why had he gotten up at dawn to follow some cooking tutorial, only to scald his hand?Why the damn hell had jealousy slipped out of him when he asked if she'd fallen for somebody else?



Catching the subtle shift in his demeanor, Yvonne's jaw dropped. With a stunned look, she remarked,"Don't tell me you actually made this breakfast yourself?"
###Chapter 31 Confusion



Julian... cooked breakfast for her? The thought sounded absurd, yet the more Yvonne studied his stiff expression and restless movements, the more she realized it was true.



A strange mix of warmth and confusion stirred in her chest.She had finally found the courage to walk away from him-so why now, of all timnes, was he showing this sudden tenderness?



Her eyes lingered on him, searching for answers. His face was as cold and unreadable as ever, but beneath the cold lay a flicker of awkwardness he couldn't quite hide.



"Don't flatter yourself," he said flatly, breaking her fragile hope. "Why would I waste time cooking breakfast for you?"



The denial struck Yvonne harder than she expected.She bit down on her lip and lowered her head, a quiet ache spreading through her chest.



An inexplicable irritation surged in Julian. He rose abruptly, tugging his coat from the sofa, ready to leave-until her soft voice slipped through the silence. "Spencer and I... we're not what you think."


Unspoken conflicts had always lurked between them,and now they threatened to break free.



His hand clenched tightly beneath the fabric of his coat. Turning back, his gaze was sharp and unyielding."I don't care what you feel for him-or anyone else.But remember this: until the divorce becomes a truth,you will keep your distance from other men."



His voice dropped lower, warning laced in every syllable. "If your affair was witnessed by paparazzi and rumored reached Grandpa, the fallout wouldn't spare either of us."



Yvonne's chest tightened as though a cruel hand had gripped her heart.



Memories clawed at her-Julian walking into a hospital beside Rita, the media headlines speculating that Rita was the mysterious Mrs. Powell.



He could do that openly, yet here he was, wielding accusations over her when she had done nothing.



Whatever fragile joy she'd felt at the thought of him cooking for her shattered under the weight of his hypocrisy. A bitter smile tugged at her lips as she answered softly, "The paparazzi don't even know l'm your wife." The words hung in the air, carrying the unspoken truth -any scandal involving her wouldn't touch the Powell name.



Julian's brows drew together. "So this is you blaming me for keeping your identity from the press?"



Yvonne jerked her head aside, refusing to meet his eyes. "That's not what I said."



Julian bent low, his face suddenly filling her vision, so close her heart skipped. His voice dropped,taunting."What if I hold a press conference right now? What if I tell the whole world who you are?"



Her temper flared hot. "You wouldn't dare! You swore you wouldn't go back on your word!"



If he exposed her as his wife, her quiet life would shatter. He wasn't promising protection-he was tightening her chains.



Straightening, Julian stepped back, his tone chilled with indifference. "That depends on you. Cross me again, and I have a hundred ways to make sure divorce never happens." With effortless composure, he turned and walked away.



Left trembling, Yvonne slammed her hand on the table, fury boiling over. "You bastard!" But as her anger ebbed, confusion crept in, dull and heavy. Her eyes fell on the bad-tasting toasts. Almost without thinking, she picked a slice up again.



One bite later, her nose wrinkled. It indeed was terrible.It was hard to imagine that a man so capable in every other arena could be this hopeless in a kitchen.


Yet that wasn't what troubled her most. What unsettled her was how differently he'd been acting.


In the past, whenever she had brought up divorce,he would seize the chance without hesitation. He wouldn't demand conditions. He wouldn't linger. He certainly wouldn't cook.


And now... he was someone she almost didn't recognize.



A faint tremor rippled through Yvonne's chest, an unwelcome spark of hope flickering where she thought none remained.



Could it be-just maybe-that Julian was beginning to care?



The notion tempted her for only a moment before she crushed it. Three years of marriage had taught her otherwise. He had never once softened toward her,never once given her the affection she longed for.And now, with his first love back in the picture,why would his heart turn to her?



Restlessness clawed at her, making it impossible to sit still.What she wanted-what she needed-was to face Julian directly and demand the truth. What exactly was he trying to do with her?
###Chapter 32 First Day



The whole day slipped by with Yvonne trapped in a storm of tangled speculations.



She shut herself inside the apartment, rarely leaving her bed. Whenever hunger gnawed at her, she wandered to the fridge, picked at whatever she found,and then sank back into uneasy sleep. Hours slipped by unnoticed until darkness pressed against the windows.



The sharp trill of her phone startled her awake.


Through the curtains, the glow of city lights spilled into the room, making the silence feel heavier, the loneliness more acute.



Blinking through the haze, she rubbed her face, willing herself back to focus, and fumbled beneath the pillow for her phone. The screen lit up with the name of TR Entertainment's HR representative. After a pause of indecision, she finally swiped to answer.



A bright, polished voice came through the receiver."Ms. Ellis, have you made your decision yet? Will you be joining TR Entertainment? In case you didn't know,the benefits package we offer is excellent." Her grip tightened around the phone. Would she accept it or not?



All day, Yvonne had wrestled with the question. She had agreed to Julian's impossible challenge-five million in three months. Yet the reality gnawed at her Filming a drama or a movie would take at least half a year, and by then, her swelling belly would betray the secret she was desperate to hide.



If not directing, then what path remained? Directing had been her only true passion, the one thing she cherished as much as-or perhaps even more than-Julian. Leaving him didn't mean she had to abandon her dream...did it?



"Ms. Ellis?" The HR rep's cheerful reminder jolted her back.



Snapping out of her daze, Yvonne tightened her grip on the phone. After a long, steady breath and a flicker of resolve in her eyes, she answered firmly, "I'll take the job."



More than anything, she needed a job right away, even if it was just a temporary lifeline. For now, she resolved to sign on first and figure the rest out later.



Once she agreed, the HR rep walked her through the essentials,highlighting the start date. Yvonne carefully noted everything down. That day came sooner than expected. Rising early,Yvonne freshened up and applied a touch of makeup.



In the mirror, a woman with curved eyes and a gente,radiant smile looked back at her. The light sweep of lipstick gave her delicate features a healthy, vibrant glow.



Pleased with what she saw, Yvonne lingered a moment.



Since graduation, she had plunged straight into marriage with Julian. The handful of projects she had worked on back in school had never been commercial, which meant this counted as her first real job.



A restless mix of nerves and anticipation stirred in her chest. After checking her makeup once more, she leaned close to the mirror and whispered encouragement to herself. Only after confirming she had forgotten nothing did she finally step outside.



Downstairs, a gleaming white Range Rover idled at the curb,already waiting.



When Yvonne stepped closer, Spencer swung the door open, holding a lush bouquet of fresh flowers in his arms.


Her eyes widened at the sight. "Spencer? What are you doing here?"



He offered a calm, tender smile as he extended the bouquet toward her. "It's your first day at work. I came to send you off properly."



The fragrance of the blossoms lingered as Yvonne accepted them, a surprised smile breaking across her face. She brushed her fingertips lightly over the petals and teased, "I'm starting a job, not going to school.I don't need a parent walking me in on the first day."



Spencer chuckled softly, his gaze never leaving her."The first day at work matters just as much as the first day at school. Remember the first day of school life?I walked you in that morning too."



His voice softened as he studied her, affection hidden in his eyes. "Back then, you always clung to me for comfort, always stayed by my side. But the older we grew, the further away you drifted. Yvonne... I still hope you'll lean on me. Even if..."



He hesitated, weighing his words before saying at last,"Even if you only think of me as nothing more than a friend."



His words about their childhood pulled Yvonne into a daze.In those days, the Ellis family had yet to collapse,and her parents were constantly away, leaving her in the care of their neighbors, the Briggs family. She used to grumble about her parents' absence,sometimes even blurting out that they might as well never return. In the end, those careless nonsense became her reality.



Tears pricked at her eyes as the past washed over her.Spencer reached up, brushing a loose strand of hair from her cheek, his tone low and comforting. "The anniversary of your parents' passing is coming up. Do you want me to go with you to pay your respects?"



Yvonne forced a shaky smile, dabbing at her tears before nodding. "Alright. Thank you."


"There's no need for thanks between us," Spencer murmured softly, shaking his head.



He stepped back toward the car and pulled the door open for her. "Come on, I'm your exclusive driver today. Let me take you to work."



A watery laugh escaped her as she bent down and slid into the seat.



Neither of them realized a discreet black luxury car sat quietly a short way down the road



Inside, Julian watched the white Range Rover vanish,his face unreadable. His long fingers snapped the cigarette in half just as the car disappeared from sight. Morton, barely daring to breathe, glanced nervously at the time before stammering, "Mr. Powell, we...we missed the chance to drive Mrs. Powell. Should we..."



Julian interjected, his words laced with cold steel,"Head to the company."
###Chapter 33 Pleasing



The moment Yvonne stepped into TR Entertainment's headquarters, she sent a polite message to the HR representative who had contacted her, ready to begin the onboarding process.



This job may have been tied to Julian's demands, but no one here knew she was his wife. She had no intention of pulling strings or using shortcuts; she wanted to go through the same channels as any other new hire.



The reply told her to wait for a few minutes. But instead of the HR staff, someone else arrived to meet her.



From across the lobby, a man in a tailored suit strode forward,surrounded by assistants and staff. His rimless glasses framed a smiling face that carried the polished charm of a seasoned executive.



Stopping in front of her,he extended his hand warmly."You must be our new director, Ms. Yvonne Ellis,correct? Brock Fuller, General Manager of TR Entertainment. A pleasure to finally meet you."


Caught off guard, Yvonne blinked but quickly recovered, shaking his hand. "It's an honor, Mr. Fuller." Still, confusion twisted inside her. First days usually began with paperwork and HR briefings-not a personal welcome from the general manager himself.



Brock's enthusiasm didn't falter. His gaze lingered on her with a spark of admiration as he turned to those behind him. "Take a good look at Ms. Ellis. Beauty and talent combined. I can already see her future filled with accolades and blockbuster hits. TR Entertainment truly struck gold in bringing her on board."



The staff echoed their agreement, nodding and murmuring praises. Yvonne's skin prickled with discomfort. The praise felt too heavy, too rehearsed.She wanted to shrink into her seat and disappear.



Julian's shadow loomed in her thoughts. Had he already spoken to them about her?



While she wrestled with the unease, Brock leaned closer, his tone warm and confident. "I've gone through your resume in detail-it's impressive. As it happens, we're preparing a major project, a blockbuster with a budget over one hundred million. I believe it's a perfect fit for you. Shall I have the script sent over for you to review?"



Yvonne's thoughts tangled into knots. Julian had thrown down an impossible challenge-earn five million on her own. If that was his test, why place a massive project in her lap? Was this his twisted idea of balance, or did Brock truly believe in her abilities?



She couldn't unravel it, but the chance was too good to hesitate over. Her lips curved into a grateful smile as she said warmly, "Thank you so much, Mr. Fuller!"



Brock dismissed her thanks with an easy wave before turning to his aide. "Edwin, show Ms. Ellis the script."



Edwin Happer stepped forward at once, his tone brisk but friendly. "Of course. Ms. Ellis, please come with me."



Still reeling from the unexpected turn, Yvonne followed him out of the lobby.



The moment she was gone, Brock's practiced smile melted,his eyes narrowing with calculation.



One of his assistants, unable to hide his confusion,Leaned closer. "Mr. Fuller, I've read Yvonne's file. Yes,she's well-educated and has won a few minor awards,but she's still relatively green. Is it really worth giving her this kind of spotlight?"



Brock's gaze flicked to the man, his voice deliberately slow. "You don't get it, do you? Do you know who insisted she be recruited here?" The assistant blinked, shaking his head.



"It was Julian," Brock replied, his tone carrying weight. "The head of Powell Group-and our largest investor.He personally put her name forward. Does that sound like a woman we can treat as ordinary?"



The assistant's jaw dropped. "Then... is she an illegitimate daughter of thePowell family?"



Brock slapped the man lightly across the back of the head. "Idiot! When has Julian ever gone out of his way for any woman? She's not some hidden child. She's his wife. The Mrs. Powell the media's been chasing shadows over. And we'd be fools not to curry favor with her."



The assistant rubbed his head sheepishly, still looking bewildered. Just then, his phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, and his expression shifted in shock.Handing it to Brock, he stammered, "Mr. Fuller... in light of this, do you still think we should keep pleasing Yvonne?"



Brock's eyes dropped to the phone screen, and the color drained from his face. He staggered back a step,so rattled he nearly lost his footing.



Blazing	across the display	was a bold headline: "Powell Group's CEO Seen at Baby Boutique with His Wife-The Enigmatic Mrs. Powell Finally Unveiled!"



Beneath the headline sat a photograph. The angle cut off most of Julian's features, but his identity was unmistakable. Beside him stood a woman with a gentle smile, her gaze fixed on him with unmistakable tenderness.
###Chapter 34 Sudden Shift



Inside the reading room, Yvonne sat hunched over the thick script, her focus unshakable.



The project was an adaptation of a once-popular novel, one with a rabid fan base that could turn on the production at the slightest misstep.



The problem was clear: the novel, though beloved,had aged poorly. Twists that once captivated now felt illogical, even laughable.


As director, it fell on Yvonne to reshape those flaws into something coherent,all while honoring the spirit of the original.



She pondered on the end of her pen for a moment,then leaned in, scribbling notes into the margins,jotting down every flash of inspiration.



Across from her, Edwin poured coffee with exaggerated care, his grin stretched too wide, his words of praise flowing endlessly. His flattery was suffocating, but Yvonne understood-it wasn't about her. It was about Brock.



That trust, misplaced or not, weighed on her shoulders She needed to prove she could deliver What Yvonne didn't notice was the figure lingering at the doorway-Brock's assistant, motioning Edwin out for a whispered exchange



When Edwin returned, the warmth in his smile had curdled into something sharp. He cleared his throat,his voice suddenly laced with condescension."Yvonne,there's no need for you to keep studying that script.Since you're new, I've arranged other work for you."



Yvonne blinked, caught off guard by the sudden shift but she forced a smile as she stood. "Alright. What would you like me to do?"



His eyes flicked over her, and a smirk twisted his lips."You're still a newcomer, after all.Head down to the studio and handle the grunt work."



Her body went rigid, disbelief clouding her face."Grunt work? In the studio?"



Her gaze dropped to the script in her hands, and she forced another smile, though it trembled. "There must be some mistake. This production is set to start casting in just a few days. Shouldn't I be preparing for that instead?"



In all her years, she had never heard of a director being ordered to sweep floors and fetch coffee on set. The absurdity of it stunned her Edwin let out an exaggerated groan, his eyes rolling so far back it almost looked painful. "You're out of the picture. Someone else will be directing from now on."



Yvonne's mouth fellopen as she tried to process his words."What happened? Why am I being replaced?"



With a sharp glare, Edwin retorted, "Why do you even care? Go do whatever grunt work they assign you at the studio, or just hand in your resignation if you can't handle it!"



Her grip tightened around the script, frustration burning beneath her calm exterior. She could take challenges in stride, but this situation was simply unfair.



Despite the urge to protest, Yvonne forced herself to stay collected. She was not about to make enemies on her very first day. After a pause, she nodded and replied, "Fine. I'll head over now."



The director's role was what she wanted from the start, and she knew she wouldn't be stuck doing meaningless tasks forever. Yvonne had confidence in her skills-if anyone gave her a real chance,she would prove herself.



She placed the script back on the table and pushed herself to her feet. As she reached the threshold,Edwin's voice, dripping with sarcasm, cut through the  air.



"Using connections to climb up,huh? Mr. Powell's wife is still in the picture. Did you honestly think you could snag him away and play the mistress?"



Yvonne stopped in her tracks, completely taken aback."What are you even implying?"



Instead of answering, Edwin rolled his eyes again and stalked off, radiating disdain.



Left alone, Yvonne felt a storm of emotions swirling inside her. At that moment, she could no longer deny that the strange treatment she received was tied to Julian.



Still, the accusation made no sense to her. She had never tried to pursue Julian that way.



Just then, two employees wandered by, their voices carrying into the room.



"Did you catch the headlines? Mrs. Powell is gorgeous -she and Mr. Powell actually look good together."



"I just read that she used to model for some international label. Honestly, I wish I had her luck!"



"I thought Mr. Powell was the type to keep his private life locked away. Is he finally letting everyone know about his wife?" Their chatter drifted away, leaving Yvonne standing in place, numb and shivering as a strange emptiness crept over her.



She pulled out her phone and was instantly greeted by a flood of notifications. On a whim, she tapped one alert. There it was-a headline featuring a picture of Julian standing beside Rita.
###Chapter 35 Just Another Worker
The empty corridor rang with the hollow sound of Yvonne's bitter laugh as she slid down the wall and sank onto the cold floor, her vision blurred by tears.



She kept rereading the news describing Julian's open display of affection to Rita, every word cutting through her until her heart felt frozen, the chill settling deep into her bones.



At last, the truth struck her-Julian hadn't hidden his marriage because he disliked publicity. He had simply never acknowledged her as his wife, which was why he never once revealed her existence.



She had no reason to doubt the report's authenticity.In three years of marriage, not a single photo of them had surfaced, and no media outlet would have dared print anything without Julian's explicit approval.



The dream she had clung to in vain for years, Rita snatched the moment she returned.



It was clear now-Julian couldn't even wait for the divorce to und before he rushed to bestow Rita with affection. Yvonne's chest felt crushed under the weight of that realization, her heartbreak so suffocating it left her reeling. If Julian truly adored Rita, why cling to their sham of a marriage?



He had always kept her at arm's length, letting her cling to fragile hopes only to grind them to dust himself. Was tormenting her some kind of cruel pastime for him?



The memory of Edwin's sneer flickered in her mind-his shifting manners now made sense.



Julian's demeanor during the interview must have convinced Brock she was Julian's wife, which explained the exaggerated respect. But with Julian's PDA now, she was nothing more than a miserable fraud.



Swiping away her tears, Yvonne gave a holow laugh at her own expense and pushed herself to her feet.



The truth was merciless: she had gained none of the privileges of being Julian's wife, only the pain that came with the title.



And really, what did it matter anymore? Divorce loomed, and whoever Julian chose to parade before the world was none of her concern. She reminded herself she was just another worker now.

 With that thought, she squared her shoulders and prepared to head to the studio, ready to bury herself in menial tasks.



The studio was a whirlwind of clutter, light stands and cables strewn across the floor. Trevor Clayton, the photography director, hunched over his camera, fine -tuning the settings with practiced precision.



His assistant leaned closer, muttering with thinly veiled irritation, "Mr. Clayton, I heard some new hire with inside connections is getting dropped into our team.What are we supposed to do-work ourselves to the bone while babysitting them?"



Trevor, with his sharp features, barely looked up. His voice carried a cool detachment. "As long as they don't strut around acting like they know everything and screw up my work, they can do whatever they please."



That didn't soothe the others. Among the crew,resentment simmered. In this industry, directors and actors soaked up the spotlight, while the film crew hauled the weight in sweat and silence. Now, being asked to pamper some so-called connected newcomer felt like an insult.



Whispers of mischief passed quietly through the team If this rookie dared step wrong, they'd make damn sure the punishment was hell to endure. Their hushed scheming cut short when the studio door opened.



Yvonne appeared, the picture of calm professionalism in a crisp white blouse. A faint, composed smile softened her delicate features. Pausing at the threshold, she rapped politely on the doorframe and spoke in a clear, melodious tone. "Excuse me, is this the photostudio?"



A sudden lightness swept through the studio, as if a clean breeze after rainfall had blown away the stale,heavy air.



The staff who had been whispering about making things difficult for her quickly replaced their scowls with eager smiles, stepping forward to welcome her with forced warmth.



Trevor alone stayed detached. He shot Yvonne a cool glance and answered with nothing more than a dismissive snort.



To him, she was nothing but another worthless beauty,someone who wouldn't survive two days in the grueling rhythm of the studio In the CEO's office at Powell Group, the air feltthick with tension. Morton and the PR director stood stiffly before Julian's desk, their heads bowed low like children bracing for a beating.



The PR director swiped the sweat from his forehead and stammered, "Mr. Powell, the PR team has already slowed the spread of the news and begun deleting related posts online..."



Sitting rigidly at the desk, Julian lifted his gaze with icy detachment, his face unreadable. "What I asked was for you to find out who fed the story to the media."



The PR director's head bobbed rapidly, not daring to draw a full breath.



Julian's brows knitted, his voice carrying a quiet weight. "Enough. Go deal with it."



Relieved to be dismissed, the PR director wasted no time in making a quick escape.



Morton lingered, glancing at Julian with hesitation before venturing carefully, "Mr. Powell, do you plan to explain these rumors to Mrs. Powell?"
###Chapter 36 | Missed You
Julian paused, his expression unreadable, eyes distant as though weighing something only he knew.



The scandal with Rita had erupted like wildfire,headlines spreading as if someone were deliberately fanning the flames. Even with his power, crushing the story had been far from easy.



Yet Yvonne seemed oblivious to it. His gaze shifted to the phone lying on his desk. His private line. The only number saved there was hers. Since the rumors broke,the screen had stayed dark-no call, no message.



A bitter scoff left his lips. "No explanations needed."



Morton, watching closely, allowed himself a wry smile."You're waiting for Mrs. Powell to reach out first,aren't you?"



Julian's jaw tensed, the faintest flicker of irritation betraying him. Morton had hit too close.



The truth was, he wanted Yvonne to confront him. If he explained first, it would look like desperation But the silence from her end gnawed at him



Sensing his boss's mood. Morton added carefully. "It's her first day at TR Entertainment. She's probably buried in work,hasn't even seen the news. Give it time -once she does, she'll come to you."



Julian's eyes narrowed, though his tone was clipped."I don't need advice from you. What I need is a name.If you don't uncover who planted that story, forget your bonus this month."



Morton swallowed hard and slipped out without another word.



The rest of the day dragged. Julian moved through meetings and paperwork, but every few minutes his hand drifted to the phone, checking the screen.Evening fell, and still-nothing from Yvonne.


His grip tightened until his knuckles whitened,then,with sudden resolve, he snatched up his car keys and left.



Moments later, his car idled outside her apartment building,his gaze fixed on the lighted windows above.His jaw was set tight, his expression carved from stone,yet the restless tapping of his fingers against the steering wheel betrayed the storm inside him.



At last, he pushed the door open and stepped into the night air.



He told himself it wasn't concern that drove him here.He only wanted to make sure Yvonne didn't get shaken by the rumors spreading like wildfire. That was all.


With that excuse clutched tight, Juian headed into the building.



The moment the door creaked open, Snowy darted over and wound itself around Julian's legs.He stooped to scratch behind its ears, his voice barely above a whisper. "Where did your mom wander off to?"


With a quick flick of its tail, Snowy scuttled deeper into the apartment. Julian followed the puppy's lead.Under the mellow lamplight, he spotted Yvonne curled up on the sofa, lost in a peaceful sleep.



There was a certain tiredness in her features, but the gentle rhythm of her breathing made her look calm and content.



A wry smile played at Julian's lips. He had spent the whole day bracing himself, convinced that Yvonne would be upset about what had happened. Yet here she was, unfazed, sleeping as though nothing in the world could trouble her.



Something shifted inside Julian while he stood there watching her sleep. A rare sense of quiet washed over him, the kind he hadn't felt in a long while.
元

He could not remember the last time he shared a slice of peace with her. Trying not to wake her, Julian tiptoed over and scooped Yvonne into his arms. As he carried her, the lightness of her frame caught him off guard. She felt even more fragile than before.


He walked her into the bedroom and laid her carefully on the bed.



Yvonne didn't stir. The world could have been falling apart and she would not have noticed.


Julian hovered for a moment, letting his fingers drift along her cheek. When she was awake, she always met him with sharp words, but right now, she looked gentle and almost innocent.


All at once, a faint frown creased Yvonne's brow, and she blinked herself awake, eyes glassy with sleep.



She blinked at him, bewildered, as if unsure whether he was real or simply/a figment of her dream.



Long ago, when their marriage was still intact, Julian would sometimes come home late, and Yvonne always tried to rouse herself, just for the chance to talk to him.



Maybe tonight, on the verge of losing him, her mind wandered back to those memories



Noticing her waking, Julian slipped on his usual mask of indifference and started to pull away. Before he could, the barely-awake Yvonne reached for him,rubbing her cheek against his palm and murmuring "You're home. I missed you."



Julian stood frozen in place, caught completely off guard.

###Chapter 37 Answers



Yvonne's cheek brushed lightly against the back of Julian's hand, soft and delicate,almost silken.



For a fleeting second, his mask of cold detachment slipped. He nearly reached for her hand-until she jolted awake to what she was doing.



Snatching her hand back, Yvonne edged away, her gaze sharp with suspicion. "How did you get in here?"



The last time,she could chalk it up to him stealing her key. But tonight, she'd been at home.



His eyes darkened as the warmth of her touch vanished, the fragile calm between them collapsing back into tension.



Julian's fingers curled at his side, betraying the sting of disappointment he refused to admit. His reply came out icy. "You think it's hard for me to get a key?"



Her anger flared. "That's trespassing! You barged in without permission!"



A mocking laugh left him. "Permission? I don't need an invitation to walk into my own wife's home."


The word "wife" hit her like a slap For a moment, she went silent, stunned. Then the day's headlines rushed back, and her lips trembled into a bitter smile as tears welled. "Julian, how long are you going to keep playing with mne? Isn't this enough already?"



His brows furrowed. "What are you talking about?"



Yvonne drew in a shaky breath, fighting to keep her voice steady. "I saw the news. You've already made it official with Rita. Stop humiliating me. I can walk away with nothing; I won't disturb either of you. Just don't drag this out by refusing to divorce me."



Her composure cracked, tears spilling as she looked at him with eyes full of hurt, fragile but pleading."Please... isn't that enough?"



Julian froze,lher words lodging in his throat. He stared at her, grief and prottest burning in his chest, yet no words would come.



At Last, Juliam broke the silence, his voice low."What if I told you the headlines were nothing but lies?Would you evem believe me?"



Yvonne blinked, her breath catching. Disbelief colored evely word. "Those photos aren't fake I can tell theyiereal

The paparazzi snapped it, and the rest spiraled into what you saw online."



Yvonne didn't answer right away. Suspicion lingered,yet deep down she knew Julian had never wasted energy on lies where she was concerned. He had no reason to. And that truth unsettled her most of all.



Why would Julian ever bother spinning lies for a woman he didn't love? The thought cut Yvonne deeper than she cared to admit.



After a heavy silence, her voice rasped out, raw and trembling. "But Rita's child... it's yours, isn't it? I saw you with her at the hospital for her prenatal check-up."



She couldn't keep dodging it. The truth had to come out.



Julian's brow furrowed as realization dawned. At last,he understood the source of her torment-she had been carrying the belief that Rita's baby belonged to him.



He hesitated, his words careful, measured. "I can't reveal much about her pregnancy, but the child isn't mine."



"Really?" Her wet lashes lifted, eyes searching his face with disbelief. A sigh slipped from him, weary. "You're making this more complicated than it is. My connection with Rita isn't what you imagine. Don't let it eat at you."



The question clawed at Yvonne's throat-then what exactly was she to him?



But before the words could leave her lips, Julian shrugged off his jacket, rolled his neck with a weary stretch, and spoke in a tone that carried quiet command. "I'm worn out. I'll take a shower. Bring me a towel."



Her breath caught, and she bolted upright, eyes wide."Hold on! You're staying here? This is my apartment!"


Julian paid her no mind as he walked straight into the bathroom without another word. Yvonne clung to the blanket, feeling a knot of worry tightening in her chest.



What on earth was he thinking?



While she tried to make sense of it all, his phone began ringing from inside his jacket. Yvonne paused,taking it out and eyeing the screen. The name "Rita"flashed in bold letters. Yvonne picked up and brought the phone to her ear.



Rita's voice was gentle, almost like a whisper. "Julian,I can't fall asleep..." Without thinking, Yvonne drew in a slow breath. She answered in a chilly tone, "If you're having trouble sleeping,call someone else. Don't bother my husband."



The line went silent.

###Chapter 38 Stay Overnight
The line went dead after a short silence, and the abruptness of it made Yvonne's lips curl in satisfaction.Getting even right away had never felt so gratifying.



Julian's earlier words echoed in her mind, and they gave her the confidence she needed to strike back without hesitation.



She cast a glance toward the bathroom, and her chest softened in spite of herself.



Was his explanation a hint that he still cared for her?Or had he only said it to keep her from complaining to Roger?



rvonne's thoughts twisted in every direction as she set the phone back down, caught between believing Julian and doubting him.



Before she could sort through her confusion, the bathroom door swung open. Steam drifted out, and Yvonne froze in disbelief, her wide eyes locked on the sight before her



Julian stepped into view with nothing but a towel slung low on his hips, his chest and shoulders as striking as if they had been carved by an artist's hand What unsettled her even more was the realization that the bath towel he was using was hers. The sight of that pink towel on such a serious man was so ridiculous that it almost robbed her of words.



Flustered, Yvonne covered her face with her palm,peeking through her fingers as she stammered,"Why are you using my towel?"



Julian lifted a brow and spoke as if he were entirely innocent. "You didn't bring me one, so I had to use yours."



Heat rushed into her cheeks, and her voice cracked between outrage and embarrassment. "That's my towel. Take it off right now!"



His eyes glimmered with a playful spark, and Yvonne's stomach dropped in alarm. By the time she realized what he intended, it was too late. Julian's hand moved to the edge of the towel as though he would actually undo it.



Yvonne blurted in a panic,"Stop! Don't move. I'll grab you something to wear!"



Without givinng him another glance, she rushed out of the room, her footsteps quick and uneven. A moment later, she sfumbled back in with a plain T-shirt and a pair of men's shorts clutched tightly in her arms.
Julian's gaze darkened the instant he saw them. His voice carried an edge as he asked, "Why do you have men's clothes here?"



The question sank deeper, and his tone turned heavier,almost accusing. "Do these belong to Spencer?"



The implication stung, and his jaw tightened with fury at the thought of another man leaving his belongings in her home.



Instead of shrinking back, Yvonne rolled her eyes,exasperated. "Why would Spencer's clothes be here?These are yours."



Julian blinked in surprise, his stern face slipping into confusion.



Yvonne hugged the bundle of clothes to her chest,her voice dropping into something soft, almost wistful. "When we just got married, I bought matching outfits for us. You never wore them, though."



She wasn't reproaching him. Her tone carried no bitterness, only a quiet acceptance of the truth.


Back when she had packed to leave, she hadn't taken much from his place. Yet somehow, those couple outfits had found their way into her suitcase. Maybe she hadn't been ready to let them go. She remembered the bright, buzzing happiness of their early days, when she bought sets of everything -pajamas,toothbrushes, even mugs-dreaming of a life where they'd share the smallest details together.



But Julian had never noticed any of it.



Now, he stood wordless, his face unreadable. After a long pause, he plucked the clothes from her hands with an almost careless gesture and said, "You've got good taste."



The remark jolted Yvonne from her drifting memories.She blinked, dazed, her chest tight with emotions she couldn't quite name.



Julian made no fuss as he started pulling on fresh clothes, as if it were the most natural thing in the world.



The towel slipped away, and the sudden flash of his private part left Yvonne's cheeks burning



Even after everything they had shared before, she still couldn't stop herself from whipping her head aside, her voice sharp and flustered. "Can't you at least change in another room?"



"We're married. There's nothing left for us to hide from each other," Julian answered with an icy calm that carried an irritatingly smug edge, completely  unbothered.



Yvonne's teeth clenched as her patience frayed. "Fine.Then you can enjoy the sofa in the living room tonight."



His brows drew together, a frown tugging at his expression. "You expect me to squeeze in with that mutt?"



Yvonne's temper flared hotter."My puppy has a name.It'S-"



She never got to finish. In the blink of an eye, Julian was right behind her, his fingers closing firmly around her hand. The sudden contact made her yelp, and as she stumbled backward, she dragged him down with her.



The mattress caught them both, and Julian ended up above her, their bodies pressed close. Silence stretched between them as their eyes locked,breath brushing breath, the unspoken tension louder than words.
###Chapter 39 Warmth



Yvonne's pulse quickened, and she struggled to steady her breath as her anxious eyes met Julian's.



Never before had they shared a bed while both were completely sober.



Something about Julian's behavior tonight put her on edge,filling her with unease. She shifted beneath him,attempting to wriggle free.



Before she could get far, Julian's hand wrapped around hers, bringing her movements to a halt. There was something dark and unreadable in his stare,something that set her nerves on fire.



Leaning in, he let his breath brush past her ear, and Yvonne couldn't help but shiver. She clamped her eyes shut, caught between anxiety and a thrill she couldn't quite name.



Instead of what she expected, his voice came out flat and dismissive. "Go to sleep."



In an instant, the weight on her body disappeared as Julian rolled over and settled beside her.



For a moment, Yvonne stared up at the ceiling, her thoughts a tangled mess. Was she supposed to feel let down or grateful? She couldn't decide.



Stealing a look at the man next to her, she saw him lying perfectly still, eyes closed. Frustrated, she turned away from Julian, biting her lip.



Desire simmered inside her, but Yvonne forced herself to steady her breathing and shut her eyes, determined to fall asleep.



Just then, Julian's arm reached out, wrapping around her waist and pulling her into his wvarmth.



Julian's heartbeat hammered against her back, barely muted by his thin T-shirt,leaving Yvonne's thoughts in a whirl. She fought to steady herself and tried to pull his hand away, but his grip stayed firm.



His touch only grew bolder as his hand slipped under her shirt, his callused fingers gliding along her stomach in a way that made her shiver.



With a rush of disbelief, Yvonne snatched Julian's hand, giving him a pointed glare. "What exactly are you trying to do?"



Julian arched a brow, his tone light but teasing."You've lost weight, but your waist feels a little fuller to me."



A momentary panic darted across Yvonne's face, and  she turned away fast enough to hide it from Julian.Trying to keep her voice steady, she said, "I just ate too much tonight."



Julian didn't push the topic, and he fell silent, though his hand lingered against her stomach.



Yvonne couldn't figure out if he actually bought her explanation, but she didn't dare move his hand away.Gradually,she forced herself to get used to his touch.After a while, she realized his palm radiated a warmth that brought her a surprising sense of calm.



For reasons she couldn't explain, Yvonne's mind drifted back to something she'd seen during her hospital check-ups, where husbands gently cradled their wives' bellies, just like Julian was doing now.



She remembered thne doctor mentioning that it was the father's way of greeting the baby, who could sense it. Maybe their child could feel Julian's touch,too.



That thought comforted her, and for the first time in a while, Yvonne driftedoff peacefully,with no nausea or restlessness, snuggled up beside Julian.



Once he heard Yvonne's breathing deepen, Julian lowered his head to brush a stray lock of hair from her face, feeling strangely at peace himself. He slowly slipped his arm out from under her and was about to  settle in for the night when his phone buzzed on the nightstand.



Julian glanced at the screen and saw Morton was calling. Given the hour, Julian knew Morton wouldn't interrupt him without a good reason.



A shadow crossed Julian's eyes as he gently wrapped the blanket around Yvonne, slipped quietly out of bed,and headed into the living room to answer Morton's call.



"What is it?" he asked quietly.



Morton's voice came through the line. "Mr. Powell,we've contained the story. But it turns out someone paid off a reporter to track you, take photos, and leak the details."



Julian's gaze turned icy as he demanded, "Who was it?"



There was a pause before Morton finally admitted, "It was Ms. Adams."
###Chapter 40 A Director's Assistant
Julian's features hardened as his grip on his phone tightened. After a long moment of silence, he responded in a cold, flat tone, "Understood."



As the calI ended, Julian stayed rooted in place,eventually rubbing his forehead in exhaustion.



He should have figured it out sooner-no one but Rita would have the nerve to pull a stunt like this.



But at the moment, there was nothing he could do to stop Rita.


A sudden brush of fur against his leg pulled him from his thoughts. Glancing down, Julian spotted Snowy wagging its tail, tongue hanging out in anticipation.


A rare laugh slipped out as Julian crouched to give Snowy a scratch behind the ears. The memory of Yvonne insisting he sleep on the sofa flashed through his mind, and with a hint of mock jealousy, he grumbled, "She probably thinks more of you than she does of me now."



Snowy, unaware of Julian's words, only nuzzled in closer That night, Yvonne enjoyed the most restful sleep she'd had in years since her marriage.



By the time morning arrived, Julian had already left.Still, Yvonne barely had a moment to notice his absence, and one look at the clock sent her rushing,realizing she was about to be late for work.



She sprang out of bed, hurried through her morning routine, and dashed out the door for work.



Luckily, she made it just in time to clock in.



Yvonne breathed a sigh of relief, but there was no time to relax. Edwin strode over with a serious look and told her, "Head to the meeting room. The director's waiting for you."



Just yesterday, Edwin had told her she was no longer needed on that film. Not long after, he'd returned with a different story, this time, offering her the role of the director's assistant.



Getting the chance to work on the script was a huge step up from running errands in the studio. Yvonne knew it wouldn't be easy, but she had no intention of turning down such an opportunity. Yet the moment she walked into the meeting room,she couldn't help but wrinkle her brow. Heavy smoke hung in the air, the sharp scent making it almost impossible to breathe. Brock sat across from a man in dark sunglasses, who lazily puffed away on his cigarette



The man had a rugged look, a scruffy beard, and an air about him that warned everyone to keep their distance.



Fighting the urge to cough, Yvonne managed a greeting. "Mr. Fuller, I've arrived."



Brock gave Yvonne a brief glance, then faced the man again, his smile almost flattering. "Mr. Duncan, here's the assistant I mentioned. She's new, so I hope you'll help her get settled in."



His face turning stern, Brock added, "Yvonne, meet Mr.Rocco Duncan. He's one of the industry's most respected directors. This is a big break for you, so don't waste it!"



Rocco exhaled a swirl of smoke and fixed Yvonne with an icy, appraising glare that made her skin crawl.


He scoffed, voice dripping with sarcasm, "What's a young woman like her going to accomplish? She's just eye candy, isn't she? Fine, I'll let her stick around and see if she learns anything, but only because you asked."



(vonne's temper flared, and for a moment, she was ready to snap back. But the memory of that five-million-dollar bet made her grit her teeth and hold her tongue.



She forced herself to stay calm, reasoning that at least being a director's assistant was better than fetching coffee on set. If the movie succeeded and Julian got his five million, every bit of this would be worth it.



On top of that, Rocco was practically a legend in the industry. No matter how difficult he was, Yvonne knew working under someone with his experience would be a valuable learning opportunity.



Before Yvonne could collect herself, Rocco tossed a project sheet in her direction. "I've already picked out the main cast and some key roles. There's not much left for you to do. Just make sure the leads get fitted for their costumes when they show up."



Yvonne accepted the papers and glanced over them.But as soon as her eyes landed on the name of the lead actress, her expression changed



Rita's name jumped off the page. She was the star of the film.
###Chapter 41 Pretending





Yvonne wasn't someone who let personal feelings cloud her work, but after reading the script, she truly believed Rita didn't fit the part.


She decided to be upfront with Rocco. "Mr. Duncan, l don't think the casting for the female lead is right."


Both Rocco and Brock immediately stopped their talk, irritation flashing across their faces as they turned to her.



Rocco let out an impatient click of his tongue and shot back, "Listen, kid, you're new here. What do you really know about movies? Saying something's wrong doesn't make it true."



Yvonne kept her explanation direct. "Rita's background is in modeling, not acting. Putting her straight into the lead isn't the best call. On top of that, her image clashes with the female lead's personality-" She didn't get to finish. Brock slammed his hand on the table, shooting her a glare. "That's enough! Who do you think you are, passing judgment when you've barely set foot in this industry?"


Stunned, Yvonne realized she may have gone too far and quickly fell quiet.


Brock, however, wasn't finished. With a mocking smile, he added, "I see why you're so against Rita.It's no secret she's Julian's treasured wife, and he's the one funding this project just for her. It's only natural for you to be jealous."


All the color drained from Yvonne's face. She had no idea Julian's investment was for Rita's sake. If that was true, then why would Julian have her join TR Entertainment? Had he really not thought about the tension this might cause between her and Rita, or did he actually want her to suffer that humiliation?


From an outsider's perspective, it probably looked like she was objecting out of nothing but spite, the "other woman" lashing out at the wife. A wave of irony washed over Yvonne, and a faint,mocking smile tugged at her lips. She recalled how Julian once claimed to despise favoritism and nepotism, yet here he was, making an exception for Rita.



Everything was suddenly clear that Rita was the one he truly cared for, while she was left with nothing but empty promises and half-truths, just like the lies he spun last night.


As soon as she had an excuse, Yvonne slipped away from the studio and headed to the costume department.


She now realized that life at the studio wasn't as miserable as she had expected. Her coworkers turned out to be friendly once she shared some tips on photography and filming. Even Trevor, the supervisor who always kept his distance, gradually warmed up to her.


Approaching the costume room, Yvonne could hear laughter and cheerful voices coming from inside. Rita had shown up early, and the crew had gathered around her.


Although the rumors had been swiftly dealt with, the gossip was still buzzing. With gossip being second nature in their world, the entire crew had caught the buzz online and acted as though Rita was truly the mysterious Mrs. Powell. And even Rita herself hadn't bothered denying it.


One of the staff asked with curiosity, "Rita, now that you've landed yourself a wealthy husband,why keep working? Doesn't Mr. Powell worry about you?"


A shy blush colored Rita's cheeks as she answered quietly, "I just don't want to end up as a housewife who knows nothing. That kind of life would make it easy for someone to toss you aside."


Those words cut straight through Yvonne, and she suddenly understood the meaning behind them.


Trevor suddenly appeared at her side, his tone cold."It's true. Marrying into money changes everything.Even someone with no experience can land the lead role."


As Rita basked in all the attention, Yvonne couldn't help herself. "She's not Julian's wife," she said quietly.
###Chapter 42 Seeming Opportunity





Trevor moved through the set with purpose,checking the last of the arrangements before the cameras rolled. At Yvonne's words, he only curved his lips into a faint smile and let the moment pass in silence.



Jealous words had reached his ears plenty of times before, and he had long since learned to dismiss them. Instead of dwelling on it, he gave Yvonne's shoulder a light pat and said warmly, "Don't lose heart.I'm counting on you."


With that, he headed off to track down Rocco.Yvonne lingered, whispering encouragement to herself until her resolve steadied, then she made her way into the costume room.


The sound of cheerful chatter filled the space. Rita stood among the others, speaking with practiced sweetness, her face lit up with a gentle smile that never failed to charm outsiders. Yet the instant she spotted Yvonne at the doorway, her expression faltered, and the smile dissolved.


For the briefest second, stiffness pulled at Rita's features, and annoyance flared in her eyesalongside surprise.


The memory of last night's phone call still haunted her. Yvonne's sharp tone had unsettled her, and she hadn't been able to shake the unease long after the call ended.


But Rita was quick on her feet. She smoothed over the crack in her composure and stepped forward with an air of delight. "Yvonne! What a nice surprise.What brings you over here?" she exclaimed as though nothing unpleasant had ever happened.


Yvonne's thoughts turned sharp. She longed to expose Rita's shamelessness, the way she dared to claimn the lead role without even the talent to back it up. Yet unlike Rita, she couldn't bring herself to speak so boldly. Her lips pressed into a thin line, and she said nothing. The crew, eager to join in, turned their attention to Rita with voices thick with flattery. "Rita, you know her? She's just helping the director, running errands for this project."


Rita's eyes gleamed with calculation as she tilted her head. She stressed her words, making sure the sting landed."So you're only handling the errands around the set then..."


The group shared knowing looks, their smirks carrying a hint of mockery. Almost everyone remembered Yvonne's dazzling entry, Brock himself giving her a personal welcome. Yet within minutes she seemed to offend him, and her once-bright standing crumbled into dust.


Those who didn't know the details weren't openly cruel, but they never bothered to treat her kindly either.


Rita's gaze lingered on Yvonne, and then she softened her tone, pretending to be sincere."Yvonne, my assistant isn't here today. Why don't you help me instead? It'll be much easier than running errands all over the place."


Whispers rippled through the room the moment Rita made the suggestion. Several pairs of eyes darted toward Yvonne, some glittering with envy, as though she had stumbled into a rare fortune by working alongside Rita.


Yet Yvonne alone understood the truth behind the offer, and there was nothing generous about it.


Mockery and jealousy buzzed around her like gnats,but she kept her composure and didn't flinch. When she finally spoke, her tone was even and steady."Ms.Adams, I think you should ask someone else. My responsibility is to assist with filming, not to run personal errands."


Narrowing her gaze, Rita locked eyes with Yvonne,the silence between them heavy with challenge. Her expression softened foran instant, but then her smile twisted sharp.


"In that case," she said coolly, "I'll have no choice but to tell Mr. Duncan we need to postpone filming. Without an assistant, things will slow down, and if we lose a day, you might be the one blamed for the damage."


The words hit like a slap, and Yvonne's jaw tightened as anger flared in her eyes. She hadn't thought Rita would stoop so low.


Around them, the crew broke into restless muttering.


"Why fight it? Working for Rita is something most people would kill for. You're just running small errands anyway."


"Yeah, do you even realize what a delay costs? We're talking hundreds of thousands. Can you cover that?"another chimed in.


The murmur of voices grew louder, painting Yvonne as selfish and ungrateful.


Meanwhile, Rita basked in the moment, her lips curving with smug delight as she watched Yvonne struggle under the weight of their stares.


Clenching her fists at her sides, Yvonne forced down the fury boiling inside her. A smile tugged at her lips at last, and she gave a short nod. "All right. I'll do it."
 ###Chapter 43 Spiteful Demands





"Yvonne,would you bring me some water?" said Rita when a shoot finished.



"Yvonne, can you pass me my jacket?" said Rita when break came.


From morning until noon, Rita's spiteful demands for Yvonne echoed nonstop around the set.


By lunchtime, Yvonne hadn't even found a spare minute to sit down and catch her breath.


It was obvious Rita was retaliating for last night's call,pushing her limits and hoping to see her snap in front of everyone.


But Yvonne refused to let Rita get the upper hand.She bit her tongue, kept her head down, and handled each task Rita threw her way, no matter how petty.


With every order Yvonne dutifully fulfilled, Rita's frustration only grew, and her attempts to embarrass Yvonne became more creative and more malicious.



Watching Yvonne scramble around the set, Rita's eyes sparkled with a hint of satisfaction. Suddenly,she stood and addressed the team, "You've all worked so hard today! Coffee's on me!"


The crew erupted into cheers, falling over themselves to praise Rita's generosity and charm.


With a practiced smile, Rita turned to Yvonne,pretending to look troubled. "Yvonne, everyone's swamped right now. Would you mind grabbing the coffee for everyone?"


Yvonne lifted her eyes, her expression unreadable,as the crew exchanged uncertain glances.


There were more than a hundred people on set, how could anyone expect Yvonne to carry that many coffees alone?



Anyone watching could see that Rita was making things as difficult as possible for Yvonne. Seated behind the monitors, Rocco recalled Brock's earlier tip and decided to play dumb, pretending not to notice.


Most of the crew kept quiet, unwilling to risk Rita's wrath.


Only the camera crew looked uneasy, and Trevor's frown deepened as he prepared to intervene. But before he could, a calm and friendly voice cut through the tension. "I'll go with you."


The man who spoke up was Braden Hanson, the film's leading actor and currently the industry's hottest star, who had just snagged a Best Actor nomination and was the heartthrob every woman on set whispered about.


His unexpected offer left the crew stunned, and Rita's eyes narrowed with irritation.


Yvonne hadn't expected Braden to step in, but she also knew that as long as Rita had a chance to stir up trouble, she'd keep finding new ways, and Braden wouldn't always be there to shield her. With a polite smile, Yvonne turned him down. "I appreciate it, Mr. Hanson, but filming's about to start.We shouldn't disrupt the schedule. I'll be fine on my own."



Braden looked momentarily surprised, ready to offer more help, but Yvonne simply flashed him a polite smile, bowed her head, and walked away. He stood there,silently watching her go, deep in thought.


Seeing Rita's sour expression, Rocco quickly tried to restore order, urging everyone back to their places so filming could continue.


But the shoot was anything but smooth. Just as Yvonne had anticipated, Rita's inexperience was obvious-no matter how patiently Braden tried to guide her, she couldn't slip into character. Scene after scene, she switched between exaggerated innocence and stiff vulnerability, forcing everyone to redo the takes over and over.


After severaI failed attempts, even Braden's patience wore thin. "Ms. Adams, did you even read the script?" he finally asked. "The lead is supposed to be strong, not helpless. That look doesn't fit the character at all."


Tears gathered in Rita's eyes, threatening to spill,when the sudden sound of rolling wheels drew everyone's attention.


Instead of the humiliating scene Rita had imagined,Yvonne fumbling with dozens of coffee cups, Yvonne appeared with a small cartloaded neatly with drinks.


Breaking the awkward silence, Rocco stood up and clapped 'his hands. "Alright, everyone's earned a break. Help yourselves to coffee!"


The crew broke out in cheers and swarmed around Yvonne,grateful for the treat.


Trevor joined Yvonne, handing out coffee cups, and murmured under his breath, "Smart thinking. Looks like Rita's run out of tricks for now."



Yvonne's smile was bright and genuine as she glanced at him, sharing an unspoken understanding.


All the while, Rita stood off to the side, glaring at Yvonne with thinly veiled resentment simmering in her eyes.
###Chapter 44 Confrontation In the Costume Room
The shoot was put on pause. Out in the corridor Trevor leaned against the wall with Yvonne, enjoying his coffee while a cool breeze drifted by. His eyes flicked toward Rita, who was still surrounded by a crowd of eager flatterers.


With a scoff, Trevor muttered, "Hard to believe Julian actually goes for someone like her. She's nothing but eye candy, and honestly, I wouldn't trust her as far as I could throw her. You're lucky you're sharp, or she would've made your life hell."


Yvonne just offered a knowing smile, keeping quiet. If Trevor had any idea that Rita was actually the woman who'd come between her and Julian, he'd probably be floored.



Once everyone's coffee was finished, filming resumed. Since Rita still couldn't get her scenes right, Braden suggested switching to some of the other key moments to keep things moving.


Rocco,who understood that Rita's support behind the scenes was powerful but didn't want to waste time, quickly agreed.


For now, that meant only Rita and Yvonne were left unoccupied while the rest of the crew worked.


In the costume room, Yvonne was busy checking the wardrobe when Rita stormed in, her voice laced with disdain. "I have to admit, Yvonne, you're even more sly than l expected."


Yvonne didn't bother replying, choosing to focus on her task.



Rita ground her teeth in frustration before flashing a sugary smile. "But Julian, he'd never let his real love do this kind of grunt work. He always takes care of me."



Mentioning Julian finally made Yvonne pause. Her hands stilled on the hangers, and she turned to Rita  with a pleasant smile. "Is that so? Then tell me, why aren't you Mrs.Powell yet?"


The comment struck a nerve, and Rita lost her cool.She snapped, "You bitch! If you'd just signed the divorce papers, Julian would have married me ages ago!"


Yvonne arched an eyebrow, her patience at its end.She let out a short laugh. "Oh, you didn't know?I sent those divorce papers to Julian a long time ago.He's the one dragging things on. He was even at my place just last night. He wouldn't leave, no matter what I said."



Rita's face froze, eyes wide with disbelief. She remembered all the times Julian had dodged her questions about divorce, and jealousy twisted in her gut.


Still, she refused to let Yvonne see her falter. "Don't kid yourself. If Julian actually wanted you, why hasn't there been a child?"



A shadow passed over Yvonne's eyes. Of course, enemies always knew where to aim, and Rita's jab had landed right on her most sensitive spot.


Rita, sensing victory, continued with a self-satisfied grin, "Julian hasn't cut you loose because the timing isn't right. The Powell family's future will belong to me and my child. There's no way he'd let someone like you walk away with half of everything. The moment my baby arrives, you'll be tossed out of the Powell family with nothing to your name!"


Those words might have shaken Yvonne before, but after her talk with Julian last night, she found herself willing to believe in him, if only a little.


Instead, Yvonne shot Rita a mocking smnile. "Drop the act. Julian told me himself last night that the child you're carrying isn't his."


Rita went pale, her anger soaring until she wwas nearly retorting fiercely.


Julian had sworn to keep her secret, vowing never to expose the truth of her pregnancy. He'd agreed to shoulder the blame and let everyone believe the  baby was his. But now, he'd gone and told Yvonne everything!


Trying to recover, Rita sneered, "And you just take his word for it? Men will say anything to get what they want. If it isn't his, why does he treat me so well?"


Yvonne's eyes grew serious. That question had always gnawed at her, too. If Julian had nothing to do with Rita's child, why would he go so far for her?


Still, the look on Rita's face gave Yvonne more reason to believe there was something she hadn't uncovered yet.


This time, she decided to trust Julian's word.


With a small, confident smile, Yvonne replied, "The truth doesn't concern me. Now I have work to do."


She left the costume room, registration form in hand,not giving Rita another glance.


Rita's fingers clenched into fists, rage twisting her features. Then, just as quickly, a cunning smile appeared. She swept out of the room, made her way to the makeup area, and leaned in to quietly give the artist her next round of orders.
###Chapter 45 Secret Visit





The cameras rolled again for a scene that would mark a turning point in the story. Rita, despite her reluctance, was pushed into it after the scriptwriter and director explained every angle in detail,leaving her no room to back out.


The setup was simple but intimate-the heroine would stumble into the pool, and the hero would dive in after her. Beneath the shimmering water, a kiss would seal the bond between them.



While Rita checked her reflection in the mirror and fixed her makeup, Yvonne had been sent to help the props team, busy verifying that every piece of equipment around the pool was safe.


Engrossed in the work, she didn't notice the tall figure stepping quietly into the set's entrance.


Julian, fresh from a nearby meeting, suddenly remembered that Yvonne was working here. On a whim, he decided to stop by without giving anyone an advance notice.



His eyes swept the crew as he entered, and when he failed to spot Yvonne, a faint crease formed between his brows.


It was Rita who noticed him first. "Julian!" she called out.


Abandoning her makeup chair, she rushed over,slipping her arm around his with a girlish smile. "Why didn't you tell me you were coming? I would've been ready to welcome you."


The commotion drew Rocco from behind the monitors. His eyes lit up at the sight, and he hurried forward. "Mr. Powell, what an honor! As expected,you're every bit as distinguished and accomplished in person."


Julian's tone cut through the air like frost. "And who exactly are you?"


Brock,standing a step behind, chimed in quickly with a strained smile, "Mr. Powell, thisis Rocco Duncan-the director of our film."


Julian's expression grew even colder. "Strange.I was told Yvonne was directing this project."


The words left Rocco and Brock stunned. They exchanged uneasy glances, unable to believe that even with Rita, Julian's wife in every rumor, clinging to him, Julian openly acknowledged Yvonne.


The thought gnawed at them both. Did this man truly care nothing for how his reputation looked in front of the entire industry?


Against the weight of money and influence, no one dared to push back. Brock forced a stiff smile and explained, "Ms. Ellis believed she wasn't experienced enough to helm such a large project just yet, so she chose to step back as assistant and let Mr. Duncan direct."


Julian considered the words carefully. It did sound like something Yvonne would do-humble, willing to bear the brunt quietly. His eyes softened, and he was about to ask after her when Rita, sensing his attention slip away, squeezed his arm tighter and said sweetly, "Julian, I'm about to start filming. Stay and watch me, won't you?"


On the other side of the set, Yvonne was still occupied with the prop crew when a voice nearby exclaimed, "Look, Mr. Powell came to see Rita!They're such a perfect match!"


The words made her pause. She raised her head and immediately caught sight of the pair drawing everyone's attention.


Julian, effortlessly striking, stood with Rita hanging onto his arm, bright and lively beside him. He didn't push her away-instead, he leaned closer, saying something that made her beam. They looked every bit the enviable couple.


A chill spread through Yvonne's chest, heavy and suffocating, as if she'd just fallen into the cold po01herself. The ache gnawed at her heart. How could the man who had held her so brazenly the night before now stand so openly affectionate with another woman?


Her certainty wavered. Was Rita telling the truth all along? Which Julian was the real one-the tender man in the dark or the indifferent figure on display?


It felt like she was trapped inside a maze where every turn betrayed her, where lies and half-truths blurred together until she couldn't tell who to believe.


Julian's gaze swept across the crowd, as though he were searching for someone.


Panic gripped Yvonne. She tried to rise discreetly,but her legs were stiff from crouching too long. A wave of dizziness struck, and she stumbled.Before she could steady herself, a shove came from behind.


The next instant, water exploded from the pool in a deafening splash.
###Chapter 46 Rescue





Julian's patience frayed as he scanned the crowd for Yvonne, but every time he tried to move, more people pressed in-Rita among them, chattering relentlessly at his side.


Just as he prepared to push through, a sharp splash cut across the noise, followed by panicked cries.


"Someone's in the water!"



"Hurry, pull her out!"


Through the chaos, a faint, broken voice carried over the uproar. "Help...I can't swim..."


By the pool's edge, crew members clustered together, the same ones who had been fawning over Rita earlier.



They pointed and muttered, yet none of them moved to help Yvonne. Their nervous chatter drowned out her desperate pleas.


One of the male prop staff, leaning back with a smirk,cupped his hands around his mouth. "Quit fooling around and get out yourself! You'll wreck the pool and delay the shoot!"


Yvonne flailed in the shimmering water, coughing as she swallowed mouthful after mouthful, her struggles growing weaker with each frantic gasp.


Despair crushed her as the mocking faces along the pool blurred, their laughter echoing like knives in her ears. Her limbs grew heavy, and the last threads of consciousness slipped as water closed over her head.


At last, a nervous voice cracked the cruel chorus."Are we seriously not going to help? She looks like she's drowning-what if she dies?"


The male prop staff who had jeered at her earlier leaned on the railing, lips curled into a smug grin."No one's born knowing how to swim. You only learn when you're tossed in. Leaving her there's the best lesson she'll ever get."


He pointed toward the frantic splashing, his sneer widening. "Hey, want me to show you the basics-ah!"



His taunt snapped off in a shriek as Julian's boot caught him squarely in the chest, sending him crashing into the water.



The crowd froze, their earlier mockery evaporating,fear rippling through the silence that followed.


Julian now occupied the spot where the male prop staff had stood, his presence radiating such dominance that the air itself seemed to tighten. His piercing stare swept over the crew, sharp as a blade.


Not a word was needed for their shoulders to hunch and their gazes to drop, each one shrinking under the weight of his silent judgment. Fear of retribution chilled their blood.


Then, as if the spell had broken, that suffocating intensity lifted. Without warning, Julian vaulted into the pool, his body slicing into the water with precision,cutting toward the column of bubbles that betrayed Yvonne's fading struggle.


Beneath the surface, Yvonne felt the last remnants of her strength drain away. Her chest burned, lungs hollow, and the air that escaped her parted lips dissolved into fragile silver streams. She knew she was slipping-life ebbing with every second.


Regret pressed heavy against her heart. Reget for the farewells she never voiced, for the faces she might never see again. Most of all, regret for not glimpsing Julian one final time.


Her lashes fluttered, and her eyes drifted closed. In the hazy delirium of oxygen loss, visions blurred into dream. Through the shimmering distortion above,she thought she saw a figure-swift, lithe, gliding through the depths like a mythical merman-rushing down toward her with arms outstretched.



The figure carried the flawless features of a storybook hero, and in that instant, he overlapped with the man who had lived in her heart all this time. It felt as if the gods had answered her desperate prayers-Julian had truly come.


Her eyes went wide in disbelief when he reached her side, slipping a strong arm around her waist to pull her up.


But her oxygen-starved body betrayed her, and she clutched his arm with trembling fingers, panic still flickering through her.


He shot her a steady glance, then tilted toward her,his hand cradling her cheek as he pressed his lips to hers,sharing his breath.



From their mouths spilled bubbles that shimmered upward, the pool's sapphire depths and the fractured light above turning the moment into something dreamlike, almost otherworldly.


Her dazed gaze locked on Julian's calm, unwavering eyes, and her heart pounded like a frantic drum.


She had never confessed why did she love him so fiercely and hopelessly. Deep down, she knew-no matter how many times her life rewound, she would still fall for Julian, over and over again.
###Chapter 47 Mastermind





Yvonne sat hunched on the pool's edge, water streaming from her hair andclothes as she shivered,her complexion ghostly pale.


Julian shrugged off his suit jacket and wrapped it around her shoulders, then pulled her into his arms,pressing her against his chest to share his warmth.


Around them, the crew members exchanged uneasy glances, their faces clouded with tangled emotions.


At the back, Rita stood rigid, her fists clenched so tightly her knuckles whitened, her face etched with tension.



In front of everyone, Julian's protective tenderness toward Yvonne could not be ignored. Between the two of them lingered a closeness, a silent intimacy that instinctively shut out the rest of the world.



Eyes turned toward Rita, heavy with suspicion. How the hell could a wife endure watching her husband lavish such care on another woman in plain sight?


Rita, naturally, could hardly stomach the sight,yet she had no legitimate excuse to raise a protest-after all, she wasn't Julian's wife, as everyone boelieved.


Heat crept up her cheeks, a flush of humiliation mixed with simmering rage, and for a moment she toyed with the idea of stepping forward to spin some misleading tale.


But Julian didn't even spare her a glance. Instead, he gathered Yvonne into his arms and, with his voice sharpened by urgency, told Morton at his side,"Hospital.Now."


Morton snapped to attention and hurried to lead the way.


As Julian strode off carrying Yvonne, Rita's jaw clenched until her teeth ached. Hatred churned in her chest. If Yvonne had "accidentally" drowned today, it would have solved everything neatly. Yet Julian's sudden appearance had shattered that possibility, throwing all her carefully laid hopes into chaos.



Brock, who had been quietly observing, drifted closer with narrowed eyes. Something in Julian's behavior had stirred his suspicions. "Ms. Adams," he asked, his tone laced with curiosity. "What exactly is Yvonne's connection to Mr. Powell?"



Brock had always been sharp. With Julian's stature, it seemed unlikely he'd risk such public concern for nothing more than a casual mistress.



Rita's pulse faltered. If the crew discovered that Yvonne was Julian's lawful wife, the social climbers among them would instantly switch allegiance, and her days here would be a hell. That was a truth she sure as hell couldn't allow to surface.


Rita forced her breath to steady, masking her nerves beneath a veneer of scorn. Instead of giving Brock a straight answer, she let out a dismissive laugh and drawled, "Why don't you take a guess-what do you think they are to each other?" Brock faltered, his tongue hesitating with a mix of caution and curiosity, his eyes flickering as he weighed the consequences.


He had already offended Yvonne once; if he made the wrong call again, he risked offending Rita as well.No matter which side proved true, he would end up cornered.



That was precisely what Rita wanted. She left him dangling in uncertainty, punctuating her silence with a derisive snort before sweeping off with exaggerated arrogance.


Inside the crew's dressing room, the atmosphere shifted. Janet Finch, Rita's personal makeup artist,nervously bolted the door before rushing back toward her. Her hands trembled as she wrung them,her voice cracking with dread.


"Rita," Janet whispered urgently. "When you told me to push Yvonne into the pool, you never said the plan was to end her life! Now Mr. Powell's aware of what happened, and if he digs deeper and traces this back to me, I'm utterly ruined!" A flicker of contempt passed through Rita's eyes as she clenched her teeth. "I never imagined Julian would actually show up today..."


"You've got to help me," Janet begged, her face streaked with tears. "I only did what you asked. This isn't on me!"



Rita's stomach tightened with annoyance. If Janet had chosen her moment with more care, Yvonne would already be gone for good.


Still, she couldn't afford to antagonize her. If Janet panicked and ran to Julian with the truth, everything Rita had built would crumble.



After weighing her options, Rita forced a sweet smile and pressed a bank card into Janet's trembling hands, feigning concern. "There's two hundred thousand on this. Take it and get out of Kumvine right now. Don't come back until | tell you it's safe."


Janet clutched the card blankly, her head bobbing in a dazed nod.
###Chapter 48 | Knew You Couldn't Keep Yvonne Safe!
Kumvine Medical Center was alive with energy, the corridors echoing with brisk footsteps and the low murmur of discussions.



Spencer, his crisp white coat immaculate, stood at the center of it all like a seasoned conductor before an orchestra. Surrounded by a circle of experts and eager students-some carrying the confidence of years, others inexperienced yet brimming with awe-he spoke with clarity and authority, every word commanding their full attention. Faces lit with admiration and subtle nods of agreement followed his every explanation.



This was no ordinary lecture but an exchange with other hospitals, and Spencer, celebrated as Kumvine Medical Center's most promising young physician,handled it with poise. His performance not only cemented his own reputation but also reflected glory back onto the hospital itself.


As the session wound down, the hospital's director stepped forward. His hair was streaked with silver,yet his smile radiated vitality. He regarded Spencer with a warmth that carried both pride and approval.


"Spencer, that was an outstanding lecture," he commended, his tone brimming with satisfaction."Our hospital has been invited to join an international research project on a groundbreaking cardiovascular drug. What do you think about taking part?"


The question gave Spencer pause. As the Briggs family's heir, he was already well informed about global medical advances, and he recognized the weight of this opportunity. Joining the project would raise his professional standing to unprecedented heights once he returned.


But the offer came with a cost. Participation abroad could easily stretch a year, perhaps longer. If complications arose, it might even consume several years of his life. Spencer's thoughts kept circling back to Yvonne. He had already sacrificed one chance with her in the name of his career-was he really going to let another slip away?


What unsettled him more was the fact that Yvonne was now tangled in a divorce with Julian. If he left,who would be there for her if Julian hurt her once more?


The weight of it all made his resolve falter. Pressing his lips into a thin line, he finally murmured, "I'll need some time to think it over."


The director, understanding, gave a small nod. He didn't push for an answer and instead began outlining the project's importance, but Spencer suddenly noticed something, excused himself abruptly, and strode away.


At the hospital's front entrance, Julian appeared in a rush, Yvonne limp in his arms. He remembered her once saying she only trusted Spencer as her doctor.Reluctant as he was to face Spencer, he had no choice but to bring her here. Julian was about to ask a nurse where Spencer could be found when Spencer himself came hurrying toward them.



Spencer's gaze landed on Yvonne's unconscious form, and fury flared in his eyes. "What the hell did you do to her this time?" he snapped, his voice tight with anger.


If not for the fact that Yvonne lay in Julian's arms,fragile and vulnerable, Spencer might have already thrown a brutal punch.



Julian's brows knitted tighter at Spencer's tone,but he swallowed his anger, knowing this wasn't the moment for a fight. His voice was clipped as he informed, "She fell into the water..."


Before Julian could finish, Spencer stepped closer and pried Yvonne from his arms. "I knew you couldn't keep Yvonne safe! I'm taking her to the emergency room!"



Every instinct in Julian bristled at the accusation, but reason warned him not to waste precious seconds.  After a tense pause, his grip slackened, and he let Yvonne go.


Spencer didn't look back. He carried her swiftly down the hall toward the emergency room.


Outside, the red treatment sign glowed above the door. Julian lowered himself onto a bench, elbows braced on his knees, hands clenched together. His head hung low, shadows falling across his face.


His clothes clung to him, heavy and damp, water still dripping from his hair and pooling at his feet.Outwardly, he sat motionless, but beneath that rigid shell burned a storm of anger and helplessness.


Spencer's harsh words echoed in his ears, leaving the man who always carried himself with unshakable confidence staring blankly, shaken by a rare and bitter sense of failure.



Through the last three years, Julian had convinced himself that money and stability were enough. Only when Yvonne asked for a divorce did hefinally grasp how little he had given her as a husband.  Now, under his very nose, someone had even tried to kill her.


Julian never believed her fall into the pool had been an accident. From the start of their marriage, he knew how deeply she feared water-she avoided even the shallowest edges, always careful to keep her distance.



The memory of the crew's callous indifference gnawed at him, their mocking voices echoing in his mind.


Had he not been there today, Yvonne would've been dead before anyone bothered to lift a finger.


The pounding of hurried footsteps snapoped him from his thoughts. Julian's head lifted sharply, his gaze landing on Morton rushing over, chest heaving from exertion.


"Mr. Powell!" Morton panted, clutching at his side."We've secured the surveillance footage from the scene!"
###Chapter 49 An Act





Julian's unexpected arrival on set must have rattled the culprit, or perhaps they were simply careless.Either way, the surveillance cameras had been left unchecked,leaving evidence intact.


Morton queued up the footage and handed the tablet over cautiously to watch.


On the screen, Julian appeared with Rita clinging to his arm, the crowd buzzing around them. Not far off,Yvonne stood alone, her expression lost and heavy,her eyes fixed on the scene before her.


A pang of guilt pressed into Julian's chest. He hadn't realized she'd been watching him that way.


The footage shifted, and another figure stepped into frame. The person shoved Yvonne hard from behind.


Julian froze the image and zoomed in, revealing a woman's face twisted in rage. His brows knit tight. "Find her," he instructed, his tone leaving no room for argument.


"Right away," Morton answered, already moving.


Inside the emergency room, Yvonne stirred, her lashes fluttering as her eyes cracked open. Spencer was by her side, carefully tending to her.


When he saw her awake, his expression softened."You're up. Feeling any better?"


Her throat burned, each cough scraping raw from the water she'd swallowed. The memory of sinking, of that suffocating darkness, clawed at her.


She shook her head quickly, fighting off the terror,and whispered hoarsely, "What about the baby?"


Spencer's smile slipped, replaced with a grave expression. He hesitated, then said firmly, "Yvonne, if you truly want to carry this child to term, you need to leave your marriage soon. If you don't, I suggest ending the pregnancy now."


Her lips parted, but no words came. After a long silence, she lowered her head, the weight of it all pressing down.


Through the haze, one memory cut clear-Julian's arms pulling her up from the water, his body shielding hers beneath the surface.


For the first time in a long while, Yvonne felt as though she had been pulled back from the edge.


She wasn't the type to dwell on grudges. Kindness,no matter how small, stayed with her. And Julian's quiet gestures of care chipped away at the walls she kept forcing up around her heart.



Part of her braced for Spencer's scolding,expecting him to call her weak and foolish for wavering again.


But when his eyes met hers, there was no anger, only a heavy sigh. "The baby's safe."


Relief had barely begun to wash over her when his tone sharpened. "But listen carefully! A shock like this is too much for the child. If you'd been without air for another minute, the baby would've been gone."


Yvonne's head dropped low, guilt pressing into her chest. Then, almost timidly, she glanced back up."Did... did he bring me here? Where is he now?"



A twist of pain crossed Spencer's face. He, who could once argue fearlessly before a room of scholars, suddenly found the words bitter on his tongue. At last he nodded. "He's waiting outside."



Drawing a slow breath, he continued, unable to hold back, "Tell me the truth, Yvonne. What's happening between you and Julian? You swore you would divorce. Is he stopping you?"



Her lips trembled before she whispered, "I don't even know what we are anymore."


Her heart was torn in two. Julian's tenderness left her shaken, yet the shadow of Rita clinging to him cut her deeply.


And still, when she thought of the way he had dived into the pool, the desperation in his eyes, it hadn't looked like pretense.


Against her will, a fragile hope stirred inside her-that maybe, just maybe, Julian's feelings for her were real.


Spencer's chest tightened with a familiar ache, the sting of being pushed to thesidelines once more. Yet this time, he refused to surrender so easily.


Without warning, he leaned forward and said, "If you really want to uncover how he feels about you,let me help."


Yvonne blinked, startled by the sudden offer. A faint smile tugged at Spencer's lips as he added, "We can stage something-an act between us. It might be the only way to see where his heart truly lies."
###Chapter 50 Confrontation Between Two Men

Yvonne's face still carried that faint, bewildered look.Under that gaze, Spencer felt like a pathetic liar,weaving justifications to serve his own desires.


Shame prickled in his chest, but at this moment,he convinced himself it was the only path forward.


He cleared his throat and said carefully, "Julian isn't refusing divorce because he loves you. He's acting out of fear. It's a man's possessiveness-he might not want you, but he sure as hell doesn't want anyone else to take you."


Her teeth pressed into her lower lip, and though she wanted to reject his reasoning outright, she couldn't.


Spencer's words hit uncomfortably close to the truth.Julian had only changed after witnessing her draw closer to Spencer. Softening his tone, Spencer leaned in slightly nervous hope flickering in his eyes. "If you want proof, there's one clear way to test it. You and I... we could confirm it by being together."


Yvonne's eyes flew wide, and she cut him off before he could even finish. "That can't possibly happen!"


A sharp sting of regret pierced Spencer as he realized he'd rushed too far. He forced a casual shrug, masking the ache in his chest with a wry smile. "Just tossing the idea out there. If it makes you uncomfortable, forget | said anything."


She lowered her gaze, teeth pressing into her lip.She wasn't naive-she could tell whether his words had been lighthearted or spoken with sincerity.


But in her heart, Spencer had never been more than a cherished friend.



Julian already filled every corner of her soul, leaving no space for anyone else. She couldn't allow Spencer to foster false hope, nor could she afford to string him along. Her tongue lingered on the edge of honesty, but Spencer seemed to sense the unspoken rejection.Before she could say a word, he hurried on with a gentler tone. "The day after tomorrow marks your parents' death anniversary. I ordered flowers. Let me go with you, alright?"


The chance to respond slipped away as the emergency room door banged open. Julian appeared in the doorway, his expression carved from ice. HHis voice cut through the air like a blade. "Dr. Briggs,your company won't be necessary. I'll take my wife myself."



Julian grew tense when Spencer didn't emerge after the surgery light turned green and the nurses had already left. Unease coiled in his chest, and though he hadn't intended to linger, his steps slowed near the door. Through the crack, he caught Spencer's voice-calm,coaxing Yvonne to divorce him.


If not for Yvonne's sake, Julian would have stormed in and made Spencer regret every word. Spencer, however, didn't rise to the unspoken challenge.His eyes narrowed briefly before he forced a wry smile, turning back to Yvonne. His voice dropped to something almost tender. "Yvonne, I meant no harm. Your parents were always good to me, and before they passed, they asked me to look out for you. I only wanted to honor their memory by going with you."



Yvonne's lashes trembled, her eyes glistening as she gave a faint nod.


Then Spencer faced Julian, his composure sharpening into something more defiant. "Mr. Powell,Yvonne means a great deal to me. I can't stand to see her endure this kind of misery. These last three years have been hell for her."


His tone hardened, every word deliberate. "During your marriage, I doubt you've gone with her even once to pay respects to her parents. Why interfere now,of all times?"


Julian's fists tightened, his knuckles paling as his eyes narrowed with simmering restraint. He finally understood that Spencer wasn't just meddling-Spencer had deliberately struck at his weakest point,cloaking it as concern for Yvonne.


The two men locked gazes, neither raising a hand,yet the tension between them crackled like static in the air.


Julian let out a frigid sneer, his voice edged with menace. "You're nothing but an outsider-so keep your concern to yourself. Starting now, I will be by her side for every visit."


The clash of words made Yvonne's chest sink with weariness. She longed to break their standoff, but a sudden throbbing pain pierced her skull. With a muffled groan, she pressed her hand to her temple.


Julian noticed instantly, the hard lines of his face shifting as he abandoned Spencer and hurried toward her.



Spencer rushed forward too, both men reaching for her at once, their hands hovering protectively as identical words tumbled from their mouths. "Are you all right?"
###Chapter 51 I'll Get To The Bottom Of This
Yvonne's strength gave out, and she weakly pushed both men aside. "I'm utterly exhausted. Can't you just stop fighting?"


Spencer and Julian exchanged a brief, angry/ glance,and the two quickly looked away, each letting out a scoff as they retreated a step.


Keeping his voice cool, Spencer addressed Julian."What Yvonne needs now is rest. Let's leave her in peace."


With a subtle lift of his brow, his tone came out cool and detached. "Then you should go. I'm her husband, and it's my duty to stay and take care of her."



Spencer's expression hardened at the shameless claim, ready to snap back-until Yvonne's tired voice  cut in first, "You leave too."


Julian's face froze for a moment.


Spencer let out a faint, mocking chuckle, then turned back to Yvonne with a softened expression."Rest well, then. I won't bother you anymore."


With her eyes already closing, Yvonne gave the smallest nod."Alright."


She drifted toward sleep as she listened to footsteps toward the door and the muted click of the door shutting.


She let out a faint sigh, convinced both men had gone. When her eyes fluttered open, she froze-Julian was still there, his tall frame casting a shadow by the bed.


"Why are you still here?" she asked, startled.


Dropping his gaze, Julian spoke in a low voice. "Over the past three years, whenever that day arrived1,1was caught up in business trips. I never deliberately avoided going with you to honor your parents." The silence betwween them grew heavy. Yvonne's breath slowed, and after a long pause, she turned her face aside with studied indifference. "You don't need to pay attention to Spencer's nonsense. I'm not a child. I'm perfectly capable on my own."


Julian hesitated, words caught in his throat. After a brief silence, he said instead, "I'll find out the truth about what hapopened on set today."


Her lashes quivered, betraying the calm mask on her face. She glanced back at him, wavered, then asked softly, "And if it turns out to be Rita?"


She couldn't shake the memory of the afternoon.The only person who had lingered so close was a makeup artist, whose eyes were constantly flitting in her direction, and whose presence was just a little too deliberate.



What unsettled her most was that the woman worked exclusively for Rita. Within the entire crew, Rita alone seemed to long for her to be buried and gone.


At first, Yvonne kept quiet, uncertain how Julian  would react if she spoke up. Deep down, she doubted he would ever truly hold Rita accountable.


Her suspicion was confirmed the moment he furrowed his brow and cut her off, "Don't let your imagination run wild. Rita can be spoiled and stubborn, but she'd never play around with someone's life."



The words sank into Yvonne like a stone. Her heart plummeted.


On the stark hospital bed, her pale face twisted into a hollow laugh. What else could she possibly say?Even with undeniable proof, Julian would stand against the whole world to keep Rita safe. To him,Rita was likely some goddess beyond stain or fault,flawless forever.


How completely naive she had been, believing that a few small, tender gestures meant she had finally surpassed Rita in his heart.


The emergency room sank into silence until Julian finally exhaled a weary sigh. "I'll get to the bottom of this. For now, you need to focus on recovery."


Yvonne's chest tightened with despair. She had no energy left to argue. Turning her back to him, she shut her eyes, her face pale against the pillow.


Julian's mouth thinned, his expression unreadable.Without another word, he turned and strode out.


A single tear slipped down Yvonne's cheek, unseen in the dim light.


Outside the door, Julian's face hardened instantly,his eyes as cold as steel. Pulling out his phone, he dialed Morton, his voice clipped and icy. "Dig into Rita's involvement. I want answers." ###Chapter 52 His Invitation





Rita sprawled across the sofa in her apartment, the silky burgundy nightgown clinging to her curves as if it had been made for her alone.


Between her fingers dangled a lit cigarette, while in her other hand she held a photograph. She drew in a long puff, then exhaled slowly, the smoke curling over the picture as her eyes grew distant.


The photo captured a man and a woman locked in what seemed like eternal bliss. The man's smile was dazzling, the sort that could effortlessly win hearts.The woman, cloaked in a pure white gown and veil,leaned against him with all the warmth of a bride lost in love.


Rita studied the image for what felt like an eternity,then snapped open her lighter with a sharp flick.


Fire licked at the edges, creeping inward until the photo was consumed. The acrid scent filled the room as the man's bright grin warped and disappeared in the flames.



In the glow of the firelight, the bride's face seemed to melt into Rita's own features, blurring the line between them.



Rita's voice was soft, almost tender, as though speaking to someone far away. "Liam, you'd want me to live well, wouldn't you? Once Julian and I are married, I'll be sure to honor you."


The last ember broke apart in her hand, crumbling into ash.



From this moment forward, there would only be Rita,and her heart would belong to Julian alone.


The sudden pounding on the door shattered the silence, heavy and urgent. Startled, Rita flinched,realizing too late that the cigarette had burned down to her fingers. She hissed at the sting and dropped it,cradling the small burn. A chill of unease began coiling in her chest. Hastily, she threw open a window, letting the burnt-plastic smell drift away, then walked toward the door.On the other side stood Morton.



Rita's eyes widened. "Morton? What are you doing here?"


He offered a polite, practiced smile. "Mr. Powell asked me to escort you to the Golden Sea Hotel.He's waiting for you in the penthouse suite."


Her eyes grew wider still, her surprise giving way to a rush of breathless emotion.



The invitation had come at midnight-Julian, asking her to meet him alone in the penthouse suite of a five-star hotel.


Rita had always assumed his stoic nature would make him slow to desire her, yet the urgency of this invitation thrilled her.



Feigning shyness, she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and murmured softly, "Give me a moment. I'll change into something proper." Morton inclined his head with practiced courtesy, his expression unshaken even as her nightgown clung provocatively to her figure.


When she emerged, she wore a white dress, pure and flowing. The choice was intentional. The first time she had met Julian abroad, she had worn something just like it-and both he and Liam Turner,still friends then, had been mesmerized by her beauty.


The Golden Sea Hotel rose like a jewel in Kumvine, its gilded facade gleaming under the night sky. Inside,every chandelier and marble pillar seemed to whisper wealth, as though even drawing breath there carried a price.


At the very top sat the penthouse suite, Julian's private sanctuary-lavish, untouchable, forbidden to all but him.


Morton delivered her to the door, bowed, and departed without a word. Rita barely spared him a glance. Excitement and anticipation carried her across the threshold. The thick wool carpet cushioned her steps, making her feel as if she were walking on clouds.


The suite was cloaked in darkness, lit only by a thin wash of moonlight spilling through the window. A figure sat in shadow, motionless in the distance.


Her lips curled into a playful smile. "Julian,why don't you turn on the lights?" she teased, her voice soft and coy.


The shadow stirred but offered no reply. A chill crawled up Rita's spine, smothering the giddy rush that had carried her here. Doubt tugged at her steps,yet curiosity pulled her forward, each pace more hesitant than the last.



Without warning, the suite flooded with light. Rita flinched, raising a hand to shield her eyes until they adjusted.When her vision cleared, the smile froze on her lips and drained into horror.


Janet sat lashed to a chair, her wrists and ankles bound, her mouth sealed tight with tape. Tears streaked down her cheeks as she thrashed helplessly, eyes wide with terror, shaking her head as if to scream a desperate plea Rita could not hear.
###Chapter 53 Send Her Abroad





Janet somehow tore free fromthe bindings in a sudden burst of desperation, ripping the tape from her lips as she stumbled forward. She collapsed at Rita's feet, her face streaked with tears. "Rita, please -save me! I was about to get on the plane, but they caught me... I couldn't get away!"


Rita didn't move. She stood stiff and pale, as though her soul had slipped from her body. Her thoughts spun wildly.


How had Julian found Janet sofast?


When Rita gave no answer, Janet's sobs grew shriller. She clutched at Rita's legs, her voice breaking. "Rita, it was you who told me to-"



"Silence!" Rita exclaimed, her eyes flashing. "What nonsense are you spouting? I don't know what you're talking about!" Her chest rose and fell violently. In a sudden burst,she seized Janet by the collar, forcing her upright with trembling hands. "This was your doing,and yours alone. You couldn't stomach her better family background, so you shoved her into the pool. Do you understand me?"


Janet froze, staring up in confusion, betrayal written across her tear-soaked face. She had only been blinded by her hunger for more, never realizing that in the ruthless circles of the elite, pawns like her were destined to be discarded.



Then came the sound-measured, deliberate footsteps cutting through the room like a blade.


Rita's head whipped around, her entire body trembling. Her eyes landed first on the gleam of polished leather shoes. Her aura weakened. She bowed her head instantly, unable to summon the courage to lift her gaze.


The steps stopped just before her. A voice, cold as steel,fell from above. "Explain yourself." Rita's stomach dropped. Panic clawed up her throat.This was different-Julian's fury was real this time,and no feigned fainting spell could shield her from it.


Rita barely managed to part her lips before Julian's voice crashed down again, low and unyielding. "Don't even think of lying to me. You know better than anyone how | deal with liars."


Julian was not a man who moved without certainty. If he had called her here tonight, it meant every truth was already laid bare.


Rita's defenses crumbled, and tears streaked her cheeks. "Julian... please, just hear me out. I didn't mean for any of it to happen. It was Yvonne-she kept parading your marriage in front of me, and |just... I couldn't take it anymore."


A heavy sigh escaped Julian as he pinched the bridge of his nose, frustration burning through him.He had indulged her too much, allowed her too many chances, and she had crossed his boundaries repeatedly. His eyes cut back to her. "And what about the scandal you stirred last time? You asked me to bring you back and protect you, yet you summoned the media yourself, as though you wanted them to hunt you down."


Her sobs grew louder, but no explanation followed-only the sound of desperation.


Julian's jaw tightened. A single glance at Morton was enough; he stepped forward and quietly led Janet out, leaving Julian and Rita alone.


The moment the door closed, Rita seized on the chance, mistaking his silence for mercy. Her eyes lifted, shimmering with false hope. "Julian, I knew you'd never abandon me."


Her relief lasted only a heartbeat. Julian extended a plane ticket toward her. "A ticket to Briysil. You leave tonight."


The color drained from her face. She staggered back, her head shaking violently. "No-you can't send me there. If they find me, I'll be dead!" Julian's tone carried the weight of finality. "The Powell family holds power in Briysil. No one will touch you. Even if they find you, they'll think twice before making a move."


The firmness in his voice made her stomach sink.Panic clawed at her as she shook her head harder,retreating step by step. "No, I won't go. The only place I'm safe is beside you!"


Her eyes went wild, hysteria breaking through."You swore to Liam you'd protect me-and the child! Have you forgotten? He gave his life for yours!"


Julian froze, his heart stuttering at the sound of Liam's name.
###Chapter 54 Their History





Liam had once stood as Grayson Hawthorne's right hand,who was the head of the Hawthorne Syndicate,the most feared mafia in Reshuoce. Yet beyond that ruthless reputation, Liam had also been Julian's trusted friend.


Years ago, when Julian was quietly expanding his empire under the radar in Reshuoce, enemies had cornered him and nearly ended his life. It was Liam who had stepped in, dragging him from the edge of death. That debt had never left Julian's heart.



Three months ago, Liam had decided to sever ties with the mafia, walking away from Grayson's empire in search of a normal life. His defection enraged Grayson, who unleashed the full force of his wrath to hunt Liam down.



At that same time, Rita had justdiscovered she was pregnant. By the moment Julian rushed to Liam's side, the betrayal had already been answered in blood. On his deathbed, battered and fading, Liam had seized Julian's hand and entrusted him with his final wish-protect Rita and the child she carried, shield them from Grayson's vengeance.



It was that promise that had bound Julian to Rita,forcing him to endure her mistakes time and again.


But now, she had crossed a boundary that could not be ignored.


Julian's gaze turned to ice as he leveled it at her. His voice was low, carrying a hard edge. "I've allowed you to remain by my side, but you shouldn't have laid a hand on my wife."


"You were mine first! You belonged to me before anyone else!" Rita's voice cracked into a shrill cry.She stumbled closer, desperation twisting her expression, and lifted a trembling hand toward Julian's face.



A brittle laugh escaped her lips as she pleaded, "Julian, stop pretending you love that woman-you don't. You love me. Don't tell me you've already forgotten the love we once shared!"


Julian shifted aside, her hand swiping through empty air. The very mention of their past only stirred bitter amusement in him.


A sharp, humorless laugh slipped from his mouth, his tone cutting as he said, "I don't need you to remind me.I remember it all."


The rage and sorrow had long since burned out,leaving only clarity. He recalled every detail as if it had happened yesterday.


Years ago, he had rejected his family's money and struck out overseas with nothing but grit and ambition. In that foreign land, he met Rita, and they had fallen fast, believing it to be love.


Just when he had been ready to confess his true identity and place a ring on her finger, she betrayed him-falling into the arms of his closest friend,Liam-sneering that he was too poor to ever give her a 
future.


She had even demanded their relationship remain hidden, treating his poverty like a disease that couldn't see the light of day.


Because of her secrecy, Liam never learned about Rita's history with Julian, and when Julian saw how deeply Liam cared for her, he chose not to reveal the truth. Then Rodger fell gravely ill, forcing Julian to return home and marry Yvonne.


In truth, he had been content in his marriage. If not for Liam's sudden accident, Rita might never have resurfaced in his life.



When she discovered who he really was, her entire attitude shifted. Julian noticed it immediately, yet he remained too indifferent to call her out.


The memory of her betrayal flickered across Rita's face, tightening her features before she forced out a wounded tone. "If you truly feel nothing for me anymore, then why did you let me stay by your side in the first place? From the moment I came back, you
arranged everything for me. Anyone would have thought it meant something, wouldn't they?"


Julian ignored her question entirely, his voice flat as stone. "Back in Reshuoce, Liam saved my life twice.The first debt was cleared the day he declared his relationship with you. This time, I'm protecting you and the child only to settle what remains."


He didn't wait for her reaction. Bending down, he laid a plane ticket on the table and added coolly, "Go to Briysil. I'll continue supporting you financially. But if you insist on staying here, I'll give you one last sum of money, and after that, we cut all ties. Decide carefully."



With those final words, he strode out without a backward glance.


Rita's legs gave way, and she crumpled to the floor,tears spilling as sobs shook her shoulders.


The bitterness welled up inside her-she hadn't asked for much. She only wanted comfort, security, a better life. Between love and wealth, who wouldn't make the same choice she had?


Then why... why did it feel like she had committed some unforgivable sin?


Rita convinced herself that if Julian hadn't hidden his true identity when they first dated, she never would have strayed with Liam. Liam might have come from an old noble family in Reshuoce and held the position of Grayson's trusted subordinate, but his wealth still couldn't rival the Powell family's fortuine.


In the end, her fate was sealed the moment she chose the wrong answer! Over her dead body would she screw up the same way twice. This time, she swore she would cling tightly to Julian-and to the immense power and riches of the Powell family.


With that thought burning in her chest, Rita pushed herself upright, snatched the plane ticket from the table, and deliberately ripped it into shreds, letting the pieces flutter to the floor.
###Chapter 55 Hollow Promises





Sunlight spilled through the hospital window,painting the stark room in pale gold. The brightness made Yvonne squint as her lashes fluttered open.


Instinctively, she tried to raise a hand to block the glare, but something stopped her. Her gaze dropped,and for a moment, her thoughts went blank.


Slouched uncomfortably at the side of her bed was Julian, his tall frame folded awkwardly into the chair.One hand propped his head while the other wrapped firmly around hers, as though he hadn't let go all night.



The steady warmth of his palm seeped into her skin,leaving her oddly dazed.


Had he really stayed by her side until morning?


Suddenly, Julian stirred. His browNs knit together, his eyelids twitching faintly as he began to wake. Yvonne's heart lurched. She snapped her eyes shut,feigning sleep, but it was too late.


His voice came low, touched with a faint smile."Morning."


Her lip trembled before she pulled her hand back sharply. Her words came out cold. "Why are y/ou still here?"



Julian didn't answer right away. Instead, he leaned closer, the back of his hand brushing lightly against her forehead. His voice was husky, laced with sleep."How do you feel?"



The unexpected gentleness caught her off guard.For a fleeting second,her heart softened.


This was the kind of care she had yearned for throughout their three years together, care he had never once shown her. Though she had sworn to leave him behind, she couldn't help but drink it in for just a moment. But the memory of last night came rushing back, slicing through the warmth. Her chest tightened, and with sudden resolve, she pushed his hand aside. "I don't need your pity," she said coldly. "Keep your false concern to yourself."


Julian's hand dropped. He lowered his gaze, and a shadow flickered through his eyes, something torn between regret and restraint.



Her rejection stung, but he couldn't deny he had earned it.


After a long silence, he spoke again, his tone softer."The one who pushed you into the pool has already been found. She has paid the price for what she did."


Yvonne lifted her chin, her gaze locking firmly onto Julian's. "Are you really going to tell me it wasn't Rita?"



Julian's mouth tightened into a thin, hard line. "She didn't push you herself. But she was the one who orchestrated it."



The blunt confession knocked the breath from her chest. Every word she had rehearsed crumbled on her tongue. A hollow laugh escaped instead. "And what does her punishment look like?"


Julian's brows pulled together, his voice dropping low. "She's carrying a child. But I give you my word-she'll never cross your path again."


Yvonne's eyes widened before narrowing, disbelief flooding her.


That was it? That was the so-called punishment? To sweep Rita out of sight so she could scheme in the shadows instead? Was he really asking her to believe this counted as justice?



Worse still, Rita wasn't the only one expecting a child. Did he even realize their own baby had nearly been lost at Rita's hands the day before?



Every part of her screamed to throw the truth in his face, but the words lodged in her throat. She forced in a breath, willed her temper to steady, and spoke coldly."Get lost." Her emotions, already frayed from the pregnancy and the terror of nearly drowning, could no longer withstand his hollow promises. His presence only scraped against her raw nerves.


How foolish she felt, remembering that for one brief moment she had been softened by his false tenderness.



"Don't let your anger make decisions for you," Julian replied quietly, almost as though he were pleading.


The calmness in his tone only poured fuel on her rage, making her want to scream.


"Of course I'm angry! And if you can't stomach it,then give me the divorce I've been asking for!"Yvonne's sneer cut like a blade. Her eyes burned into Julian, her whole presence bristling like a wall of thorns.Every word out of his mouth only dug deeper into her fury.



Julian drew in a long breath, preparing to respond,but the sharp creak of wheels at the doorway silenced him. Both of them turned at once. Rodger entered,pushed forward by Paula, a trail of suited bodyguards following close behind.


His face was dark, his gaze slicing through the tension thick in the room. "What's going on here?Were you two fighting?"
###Chapter 56 Feed Her





Both Julian's and Yvonne's expressions flickered with nervousness for a split second. But Yvonne quickly masked it with a soft smile, slipping her arm through Julian's and leaning against him with practiced warmth.



She turned to Rodger and teased lightly, "Yes, we were quarreling. He stayed with me the whole night,and now I'm angry he doesn't look after himself.What if I get better only for him to fall sick?"


Rodger narrowed his eyes at Julian, suspicion lacing his tone. "Is that so?"


Julian's gaze wavered, landing on Yvonne with a layered, unreadable look. She met it coolly, her eyes sharp with silent warning-play along.


Forcing his lips into a faint smile, Julian steadied himself and guided her back against the pillows. His hand brushed her forehead with a tenderness that looked natural enough. In a voice lowered to near a whisper, he murmured, "I'm not that fragile. What you need is proper rest."


The two, still simmering from their spat a moment earlier, carried a tension that made their performance feel strained.



Luckily, with their backs turned, Rodger didn't catch the fleeting bitterness in their expressions.



Julian forced a pleasant look onto his face before turning toward Rodger. "Don't worry, Grandpa.Yvonne and I are doing perfectly fine."


Rodger's doubtful gaze lingered, pressing Yvonne to deflect with a quick smile. "Rodger, what brings you here today?"


"I came for a follow-up," he replied curtly, then shot Paula a sharp glance. With a huff, he added, "If I hadn't happened to see Paula carrying food, I'd still be in the dark about Yvonne's condition. Were you planning to keep this from me forever?" Julian's face flushed with embarrassment, and Yvonne instinctively darted him a startled glance.


Her sudden hospitalization was something Paula couldn't have possibly known about on her own-Julian must have been the one who asked her to prepare the meal.


Rodger remained oblivious to the silent exchange and turned his full attention to Yvonne. His voice softened with concern as he asked, "How did you end up falling into the water like that? You didn't hurt yourself,did you?"


Once the words left his mouth, his expression hardened again. He shot Julian a sharp glare and scolded, "What were you thinking? You can't even manage to take proper care of your own wife?"


Yvonne gave an awkward little laugh, just about to step in to defend Julian. But before she could, Julian lowered his head, his tone steady and sincere."This was on me. I didn't protect Yvonne the way I should have. It won't happen again." For a moment Yvonne froze, as though a needle had slipped into her heart, her eyes shimmering with a thin glaze of tears.


She couldn't tell if Julian's tenderness was sincere or just another performance meant to placate Rodger-and deceive her.



Rodger, on the other hand, seemed satisfied.He gave a pleased nod and told Paula to bring out the meal prepared specially for Yvonne.



The salad and toasts appeared, perfectly made,worlds apart from Julian's earlier attempts in the kitchen.



Julian's expression tightened as if the sight reminded him of his own lackluster cooking. Turning aside, he muttered, his voice edged with irritation, "You're still recovering. Greasy food isn't good for you, so l had Paula make something light instead."



Yvonne quietly agreed. Her stomach felt weak, and she had no appetite for anything heavier. Meanwhile, Rodger jabbed Julian lightly with the tip of his cane.



Julian turned his head, brows knitting in confusion,until he noticed Rodger tilting his chin toward Yvonne. Realization dawned, and Julian's shoulders stiffened.He hesitated a beat too long.


Rodger, clearly annoyed, gave him a sharper prod that made Julian grunt under his breath.


The sound drew Yvonne's attention. She lifted her gaze, eyes questioning.


Julian pressed his lips together, stepped closer, and smoothly took the spoon from her hand.


A sudden jolt of surprise made her blink. "What are you doing?"


With quiet determination, Julian met her eyes. "When you're sick, it's my responsibility to take care of you."
###Chapter 57 Suspicion





Yvonne blurted out almost too quickly, "No need!"


The words slipped before she remembered Rodger's presence. She forced her lips into a smile and added more softly, "I'm fine now. My hands aren't injured.There's really no need to trouble anyone."


Rodger narrowed his eyes, his stare so sharp it felt as if he could peel back the layers of her thoughts."Tell me, Yvonne-are you and Julian always this polite with each other at home?"



Her body stiffened instantly, her pulse quickening in alarm. She darted a glance at Julian, who looked just as rigid, the tension written across his face.


Rodger's voice dropped, the weight behind his words impossible to ignore. "Don't tell me the affection between you two is nothing but an act for my sake."


The accusation struck like a hammer, leaving both of them reeling. Yvonne didn't dare push back this time.She lowered herself into the headboard quietly, while Julian turned to Rodger with a composed smile. "Of course not. Yvonne's just a little shy when you're around."



Keeping her head bowed, Yvonne pretended at bashfulness, though her stomach was knotted tight,terrified he would press further.


To her relief, Rodger's suspicion eased. He let out a hearty laugh. "Good. That's good. Yvonne, go ahead and eat. I won't leave until I see you finish."


The room fell into silence. Julian lowered his gaze,picked up the spoon, and calmly scooped salad into it. He held it to her lips as though the gesture were the most natural thing in the world.


With no choice, Yvonne opened her mouth,swallowing the salad reluctantly. But the next moment a jolt ran through her, shocking her to her core.



Julian leaned closer, his thumb brushing across her lips to wipe away a trace of sauce. His voice dropped to a husky tenderness."Alright?"


Her heart hammered wildly, her nerves nearly breaking under the intensity.


When she lifted her eyes, she found herself drowning in his steady, gentle gaze, a devotion so convincing it rattled her to her core.



Heat rushed to her face. She quickly looked away,drawing in a shaky breath before whispering, "I'm fine."



Her ears burned crimson, betraying her even as she tried to compose herself.


Julian's mouth curved ever so slightly, a shadow of a smile. He lifted another spoonful of salad with practiced care and offered it to her. "Eat some more."


Yvonne forced herself to comply, bite after bite, all the while wishing she could simply inhale the whole bowl and end the charade.


Rodger, seated nearby, observed with a look of satisfaction, nodding slowly as though pleased with his own handiwork. His chest swelled with smugness,but he wasn't nearly done meddling.


Old age hadn't dulled his senses. He'd heard whispers of the rumors outside. If there was a rift between Julian and Yvonne, he knew mere appearances wouldn't fix it. He needed to press harder.


His voice took on a plaintive, almost frail tone."Yvonne, would you consider staying at the Powell estate with Julian for a while?"



Yvonne stiffened at once. Her eyes darted toward Julian, silently pleading for him to intervene. Yet he looked down at the bowl as though he hadn't heard a word.



Her jaw tightened, but she forced her lips into a polite smile. "Rodger, I've just started working... l might not have the time."


A heavy sigh slipped from Rodger, his brows sagging in feigned sorrow. "I understand, child. If you can't, then you can't."


He broke into a violent cough, covering his mouth with a trembling hand, before offering her a weary smile. "You young ones have your own paths to walk.I won't stand in the way. It's just... I'm not sure how much longer I'll be around. My only wish is to see more of the two of you together while I still can."


The words pierced Yvonne's heart, pulling at the most fragile corners of her emotions.


Her parents' faces flashed before her eyes-time she had squandered with them, time she could never reclaim.


"Rodger, please don't say such things." Her voice cracked as she brushed tears from her cheeks."You'll be with us for many more years. And I promise -I'll move back to the Powell estate."
###Chapter 58 Fallen For Me





A subtle flicker passed through Rodger's gaze as he shared a fleeting, covert glance with Julian.


For a brief moment, doubt pricked at him-had he gone too far? And why did Yvonne look as though she might burst into tears?



Julian steadied him with a composed look before remarking in an even tone, "Grandpa, once Yvonne's ready to leave the hospital, we'll pack our luggage and head back."



Yvonne's eyes, rimmed with red, dropped as she nodded without resistance.



Only then did Rodger's face light up. A broad smile spread across his wrinkled features as he declared cheerfully, "Excellent. I won't impose any longer. I've got a coffee appointment with the hospital director,so I'll be on my way!" He lifted his hand in signal, and Paula quickly stepped forward, wheeling him out of the room with brisk efficiency.


In the next instant, silence settled again. Only Yvonne and Julian remained, the closed door leaving them alone with the weight of unspoken words.


Yvonne's brief sense of relief quickly soured as the reality sank in. Pressing her palm to her forehead,she whispered in disbelief, "I can't believe I actually agreed to that!"


Sharing a roof with Julian again, right under Rodger's sharp, suspicious eyes-didn't that mean endless charades, day after day, pretending they were still the picture of a loving couple? The thought alone made her stomach twist.


Frustration bubbled over, and she shot Julian a sharp glare. "How could you just stand there and say nothing? What if we slip and give ourselves away in front of him?"


Julian, unfazed, leaned back slightly, his voice steady and unhurried. "Moving back isn't such a terrible idea."


A faint, knowing smile played at the corners of his lips, as if he almost found her outrage amusing.


Suspicion flickered in Yvonne's eyes as she studied him. Julian hesitated, then explained with quiet sincerity, "I just don't want Grandpa to be upset."



That was exactly the excuse she had expected. It left her no outlet for blame-Julian wasn't the one at fault. The only one she could resent was herself for being too easily swayed.


With the choice sealed, regret settled over her like a heavy cloak. Her shoulders sagged, anda faint weariness dulled her expression.



Julian sensed her mood faltering but couldn't come up with the right words. Instead, he lifted another spoonful of salad and held it ou. "Do you want some more?"



She shot him a sharp look, irritation flashing across her face. "Rodger isn't here now. Why are you still performing? Aren't you supposed to be working? Or is babysitting me suddenly your new job?"


Julian offered no reply. He knew perfectly well how much work waited for him-Morton had already called several times, pressing him to return to the office for urgent matters. Yet he had ignored every call.


Julian struggled for words. After a quiet pause, he set the bowl aside and murmured, "Get some rest.I should head back to the office."



Yvonne parted her lips, caught between irritation and reluctant amusement. She wasn't truly angry-just obstinate, yearning for a tender word of comfort.


Instead, Julian looked almost relieved, as if her words had granted him permission to escape. He didn't even bother to invent an excuse. At her mention, he seized the chance immediately.


Her bright, expressive eyes clouded with annoyance.
Turning he head away with deliberate stubbornness, she muttered, "Then go."


Her mixture of defiance and hurt tugged at him, but Julian assumed her sulk still stemmed from the decision to return to the Powell estate.


His mouth tightened before he tried, awkwardly, to soothe her. "Don't trouble yourself over that film anymore. Just focus on resting. I'll line up another strong project for you to direct."


Slowly,Yvonne turned her gaze back to him, her eyes searching. His sincerity made her chest tighten,yet part of her couldn't quite trust it.


For the first time, he had swallowed his pride to comfort her, stepping into the role of a husband rather than a cold partner.


She had begun watching him with suspicion at every turn, yet now she found her certainty faltering.


The question that had been gnawing at her for days rose once more. Beneath the blanket, her fingers tightened into a fist, though outwardly she tried to look calm.


With a trace of mockery in her tone, she asked, "Tell me-why are you suddenly treating me so well?Julian, don't tell me you've actually fallen for me?"
###Chapter 59 Fantasies





Julian froze in silence, a rare fog clouding his usually precise mind.


Could it be that he had truly fallen for Yvonne?


By all accounts, she had been a dutiful wife. In the three years they had lived together, she had never once caused trouble for him. But that was it-she had simply not been an inconvenience.



She hadn't been his choice. She had been placed into his life by the Powell family.


And Julian, who had always despised chains of obligation, had resisted her from the start out of sheer defiance toward the marriage forced upon him.



To admit that he might be falling for her now felt like betrayal-betrayal of his pride, his principles, of the self he had clung to for so long. But why, then, had he been softening toward her?Why had he found himself reaching for her without thought?


A flicker of unease crossed his eyes before he forced it down, steadying himself with cold logic. The answer was simple. He wasn't falling in love. He merely hated chaos. If Yvonne divorced him, it would bring waves of complication, and Julian loathed nothing more than trouble.


When he,finally met Yvonne's gaze, he spoke evenly,his voice calm, almost detached. "You are my wife.As long as there is no divorce, I won't allow anyone to hurt you."



The hope that had lit Yvonne's eyes faltered. Her lips curved upward, but the smile that formed was hollow,breaking apart at the edges. "I see," she murmured.


With forced composure, she lifted the bowl of salad,spooning it into her mouth. Her voice came muffled,trembling faintly as if she were fighting tears. "You should go.I need to rest." The words she had swallowed down-the questions,the pleas-were crushed beneath his indifferent answer, leaving her dignity in tatters.


Julian's mouth pressed into a hard line as his phone vibrated insistently in his pocket, pulling him away.


In the end, he said nothing more. He turned, his footsteps quiet as he left the room behind.


Tears slipped down Yvonne's cheeks, falling into the bowl and turning the food bitter, yet she forced herself to keep eating spoonful after spoonful.


The heaviness in her stomach built until a wave of nausea struck. She rushed into the bathroom and retched, emptying everything she had just swallowed.



Once the sickness passed, a strange calm settled over her. She rinsed her mouth, splashed cold water onto her face, and stared into the mirror. Her reflection looked pale and disheveled, but she curved her lips into a smile anyway, one that felt as fragile as glass. Inside, she repeated the words to herself like a warning-stopped dreaming of things that would never happen.


When she stepped back into the room, her eyes fell on the empty bowl. A pang of regret hit her.


She hated to admit it, but after leaving the Powell estate, Paula's cooking had been one of the few things she missed.


Her thoughts were interrupted by the buzz of her phone on the bedside table. She picked it up and saw a voice message from Trevor, his tone urgent.


"Yvonne, how are you? Are you still at the hospital?"


Before she could reply, another message followed,this time heavy with guilt.


"If I hadn't stepped away, I could've saved you myself."


She knew what he meant. The moment she had fallen into the pool, Trevor had been off checking faulty equipment. The reports that she'd been mocked and ignored by the crew must have already reached him.



Yvonne hesitated before holding down the record key. "I'm fine. I'll be discharged tomorrow."


Almost instantly, his video call request appeared.She paused, then pressed accept.


The screen lit up with the set behind him, crew members crowding into view. One by one, they greeted her, their faces showing genuine worry.


Yvonne blinked in surprise at the sight of so many faces crowding into the frame, yet she answered each greeting with gentle warmth.



Beneath her calm tone, her heart stirred. Her ties with the crew had never run deep, and more than a few had shown her disdain when she first joined them. But now, every expression reflected genuine worry, and for the first time, she felt their concern wrap around her like a fragile comfort.


Once the greetings died down, Trevor lifted a hand and spoke firmly. "Alright, that's enough. Yvonne needs to rest. Don't wear her out."


The crew scattered back to their work, leaving the screen filled only with Trevor's face. He stepped aside into a quieter corner, leaning close to the camera.



His voice dropped, carrying a note of secrecy."Yvonne, have you heard? The investors just pulled out. Our film's funding is gone."
###Chapter 60 Would You Believe Me





Yvonne froze for a heartbeat before giving her head a small shake.


The film was supposed to be a massive production backed by an investment in the hundreds of millions -Brock's prized project. How could the funding have simply vanished overnight?


A possible explanation stirred in her chest.


Trevor didn't make her wait. His voice dripped with gloating satisfaction as he announced, "Julian pulled the investment. Now the company's in total disarray.Brock's scrambling like a headless chicken, begging anyone who'll listen for help. Shame you didn't see the panic on his face-it was priceless."


The news didn't shock her in the least. Under circumstances like these, Julian would hardly risk letting Rita step into the spotlight again. That movie had been built around her, and without its leading actress, there was no reason for him to keep pouring money into it.


Trevor leaned forward, his eyes glinting with amusement. "Want to know why Julian cut the funding?"



Yvonne,uninterested, nearly blurted out Rita's name when Trevor lowered his voice and continued, "It's because of you. At the shareholders' meeting,Julian tore into Brock, demanding why you weren't kept on as the director as originally promised, and why someone else had been shoved into the role instead."



Her breath cauight in her throat. That couldn't be true. Why would Julian defend her so openly? He'd always been careful to keep their relationship hidden from outsiders.



Trevor's expression shifted, his eyes narrowing with scrutiny. His tone lost its teasing edge. "Yvonne,what exactly is going on between you and Julian?"


At first, like everyone else,he had assumed she was nothing more than Julian's mistress. But after spending time with her, he no longer believed she was that kind of woman.



And now, with everything that had happened, his doubts had hardened into certainty. A man of Julian's stature would never go to such lengths for a mere mistress-would he?



Yvonne lowered her gaze, staying silent for what felt like an eternity before she finally looked up at Trevor and spoke softly. "If I told you I was his wife... would you believe me?"



Trevor's eyes went wide, shock flashing across his face. He needed several moments to process it before blurting out indignantly, "Then why do you let Rita parade around like she owns the place? How can you stomach her arrogance?"


A bitter smile tugged at Yvonne's lips, yet no words followed. How in the world could she put into words that Rita mattered more than she did to Julian?



Reading the pain in her silence, Trevor wisely dropped the subject. After a pause, his tone grew grave. "I believe you. But not everyone will. You should brace yourself. The rumors running through the company lately... they've been vicious."


Her expression sobered instantly. She understood all too well. Once she returned to work, countless questioning eyes would be waiting. Until she and Julian openly acknowledged their marriage, the gossip would never die.


Yvonne let out a steady breath and gave a small nod."Got it. I appreciate the reminder."


Still, dwelling on rumors seemed pointless now. She had already braced herself to confront whatever storm awaited at the company. What truly weighed on her was the thought of returning to the Powell estate.



How on earth could she possibly keep her pregnancy hidden from the entire Powell family while still ensuring the baby was properly cared for? That challenge felt far more daunting than surviving a storm in the middle of the ocean. A few soft words of comfort slipped from Trevor's lips before the call faded to silence.


Afterward, Yvonne forced herself into calm. She ordered another meal and followed the doctor's regimen to the letter-eating on time, resting when told, the picture of a perfect patient that medical staff admired.



When dawn broke, she didn't wait for Julian to arrive and went ahead to process her discharge on her own.



At the hospital entrance, Spencer walked her out. His usual composure was there, but he seemed oddly drained. Dark circles shadowed his eyes, hinting at a sleepless night.


Even so, his voice stayed gentle as he offered a faint smile. "Yvonne, you need to take care of yourself.Don't forget your prenatal vitamins, all right?"


The sincerity in his words gave her pause. Why did it sound as though he were bidding her farewell? She studied his weary eyes with concern. "Spencer,what's going on with you?"


For a beat, he hesitated, then curved his lips into a wry smile. "I'm leaving the country."
###Chapter 61 Sudden Confession


Yvonne's brows knit together."So sudden-why now?"

Spencer's lips curved, but the bitterness behind his smile betrayed him. Not long ago, he had refused the hospital director's invitation to join a prestigious neurology research project overseas. Somehow, his grandfather, Frey Briggs, had learned of it.

Frey rarely meddled, but when it came to Spencer's future, his stance was ironclad. He had wasted no time applying pressure, forcing Spencer into a corner.

The ultimatum had been clear. If Spencer rejected the opportunity, Frey would arrange a marriage for him without his consent.

If he accepted and returned triumphant, however, Frey promised the Briggs family would stay out of his personal life-even if that meant allowing his ties with Yvonne, a married woman, to remain.

In Spencer's mind, there was no doubt. Julian had engineered this behind the scenes, manipulating Frey into action. The thought made his blood boiI, though he was powerless to fight it.

He kept those truths buried. He didn't want Yvonne to see him as a man shackled by his family.

Instead, he masked his turmoil with a careless shrug, his smile light as air. "It's only a research project. Six months at most, and I'll be back."

For a moment, silence stretched between them. His eyes lingered on her, heavy with something unspoken,before he reached out to ruffle her hair with rare tenderness."|just hope that by then, you and Julian will have settled everything."

The gesture startled her. She edged back, forcing a polite smile. "Don't worry about me. I'll manage."

His hand fell to his side, empty, disappointment flickering across his face.

A flash of white outside caught his eye. Parked by the curb was a Range Rover-Frey's men, waiting to take him to the airport.

As the moment of farewel pressed closer, Spencer drew in a steadying breath and asked, hls voice laced with hope, "Yvonne... if I comé back and you're no longer with Juflan, would you ever consider giving me a chance?"

Her expression faltered, the question catching her off guard. A sigh stirred inéide her chest, heavy and complicated.

She didn't want to wound him, yet she also couldn't give him the answer he longed for.

Spencer caught the hesitation in her face and already knew what her answer would be, but he couldn't bring himself to hear it aloud.

He clung to a fragile hope-if Yvonne said nothing, then maybe, just maybe, he still had a chance.

Before she could respond, he cut in with a forced smile, "I was only joking. Don't take it so seriously."

Sliding a hand ihto his pocket, he pulled out a business card and placed it in her palm. "This is a friend of mine.I've told him about your situation. If you need help while I'm gone,reach out to him."

Her gaze wavered as she looked down at the card. A photograph of a bespectacled young man with a round face sat in the corner-Rich Thorpe, another surgeon like Spencer.

Her chest tightened with both gratitude and guilt. "Spencer..." she whispered softly.

But he didn't let her finish. With a wave of his hand, he strode toward the waiting white Range Rover, his steps brisk, his posture light as if he carried no weight.

Before climbing inside, he turned back, flashing her a wide smile."Don't forget your promise to me-take care of yourself!"

Yvonne stood frozen, her eyes following Spencer as he climbed into the car. He waved with a carefree ease,as though partings meant nothing at all.

She lifted her own hand in response, but he never turned again. All she had left was the imprint of his bright smile lingering in her mind. The vehicle rolled away, wheels kicking up dust that blurred into the gray sky. The weight of farewell pressed heavily on her chest, and before long, raindrops began to fall, soft and cool against her skin.

Tilting her head back, she let one bead of water land in her palm, her heart twisting with quiet sorrow.

Goodbyes had always unsettled her. Whether they marked the end of life or simply the distance of separation, they never failed to hurt.

An umbrella suddenly appeared above her, shielding her from the rain. A tall figure stepped in close, his shadow falling naturally across her.

Julian's voice came steady, calm, carrying no trace of hesitation. "Let's go home."
###Chapter 62 Visit Alone


Yvonne slipped into Julian's car, shoulders slumped and spirit heavy. Without saying a word, he offered her a towel. She barely patted her cheeks before letting it fall to her lap. She pressed her forehead to the cool glass and watched the world blur past, her eyes dull with sadness.

Julian watched her quietly, suspicion flickering across his face.

He had tipped off Frey about Spencer refusing the chance to study overseas. That was why he'd shown up early. Even so, he stayed back, not wanting to intrude on their goodbye. Still, he couldn't heIp but think she was taking it harder than necessary.

His words came out colder than he intended. "So Spencer leaving is really that big of a deal to you?"

As soon as the question left his lips, regret flashed in his eyes. For once, the man who always seemed to have the right words slipped up and exposed his agendas.

Yvonne's head snapped around, and suspicion crept into her voice. "How do you even know he's going abroad?"

Something clicked for her, and anger quickly replaced her confusion. "Did you do something to make him leave all of a sudden?"

He kept his silence, but his expression gave him away. She stared at him, shock and betrayal mingling in her eyes, before swinging her hand toward him. "I can't believe you'd stoop so low!"

Spencer had always treated her kindly. Now, Julian wanted to strip that away too. The injustice of it stung.

Before her hand could connect, he caught her wrist, holding her in place. He looked herin the eyes,voice steady but gentle. "Spencer was going to leave eventually. Would you really ask him to stay just for you?"

Her anger faltered, her hand falling back to her side.

He didn't stop there.the youngest neurosurgeon in the country. He stayed in Kumvine because of you, even turned down a chance to study overseas. Did you think the Briggs family would just sit by and let that last forever?"

Despite their differences, he couldn't deny Spencer's talent. With the right experience, Spencer would make waves in medicine.

Tears clung to her lashes. She never realized how much Spencer had given up for her sake. If she'd known,she might have pushed him to chase his dreams abroad too.

Even if she could understand the reasons, she couldn't forgive Julian for making choices for others.

Without warning, she unfastened her seatbelt and lunged for the handle, only to find the door stubbornly locked.Frustration crept into her eyes as she faced him. "Let me out!"

He let out a sigh, rubbing his temple. "You're still upset with me, aren't you?"

She shook her head, her voice steady."I need to buy flowers."

The real reason for her discharge tugged at her heart. This was the same day her parents had left her years ago. It was never just another date on the calendar.

Julian, lost in his own thoughts and ambitions, likely didn't care. Spencer, the only one who always remembered, was already on his way out of the country.

With that realization, a wave of loneliness crashed over her. For another year, she was the only one who would visit her parents' graves.

Before she could dwell on it, he leaned across the center console, his presence suddenly overwhelming.

Her eyes widened, caught off guard. "What are you doing? Stay on your side!"

His gaze lingered on her, intense enough to make her pulse race.

A part of her braced for something unexpected, half-suspecting he'd do something foolish.

Instead, she heard a quiet click as he buckled her seatbelt once more. He straightened and faced forward,his voice cool. "No need for that. The flowers are already in the back. I'll take you straight to the cemetery." Gradually, her racing pulse slowed, leaving her breathless for a different reason. Embarrassment prickled across her face as she tugged at the buckle, unwilling to meet his eyes.

"Seriously, Julian, you don't have to come with me," Yvonne replied, barely above a whisper.

Without warning, the engine purred to life and they rolled out into the street. Julian kept his hands steady on the wheel, taking extra care with every turn, as if he remembered all too well how things went wrong the last time.

Yvonne gripped the seatbelt with white-knuckled hands, heat creeping up her cheeks. It finally dawned on her just how bold Julian could be when he wanted his way.
###Chapter 63 First Time


The car rolled to a halt just outside the cemetery gates. Powell family bodyguards stood sentry at the entrance, their presence making sure the grounds were empty except for Julian and Yvonne.

Sheets of rain swept across the gravestones, turning the cemetery into a gray, lonely world. Each drop seemed determined to keep Yvonne in her sorrow.

She managed to keep it together during the drive, directing most of her irritation at Julian. Stepping outside,though, the damp air and drifting mist pressed in on her. Her vision blurred, and she faltered, tears springing to her eyes.

Julian reacted quickly, slipping an arm around her waist to steady her as she leaned into him for support.

A simple nod from him brought Morton over, who pressed a bouquet of fresh flowers into Julian's free hand.

One of the bodyguards rushed over and opened a black umbrella, shielding them from the relentless downpour.Julian cradled the bouquet and led Yvonne gently beneath the umbrella, his other arm still steady around her.

Silent tears spilled down her cheeks as they moved together through the wet grass. When her strength gave out, she collapsed against his chest, her sobs muffled by the storm. She didn't cry out, but the grief in her trembling shoulders spoke for her.

Julian wrapped his arms around her, uncertain and awkward. He had come into'her life years after her parents were gone. Their names were rarely spoken, and he'd never seen her fall apart-at least, not like this.

Every year, something had always kept him from joining her on this day. He had told himself she would be all right, that she was always just a little quieter.

He had never realized how much pain she kept hidden away.

Just a few more steps would bring them to the gravestone, but her strength was spent. He paused, concern flickering across his face. "Do you need a moment? We can wait here as long as you want."

Yvonne shook her head, barely able to hold back another wave of tears. Her lashes fluttered as a single drop slipped down her cheek.

Her voice came out ragged. "I'm all right. Let's just keep going."

Concern flickered in Julian's eyes, but Yvonne pulled herself upright and moved ahead without his support.There was a steadiness to her steps, quiet but unwavering.

They reached the grave at the heart of the cemetery. It was Julian's first time seeing where her parents rested.

Yvonne lowered herself to the ground, pressing close to the cold marble for comfort. She let her voice drift over the grass. "Mom. Dad. I came to visit you."

Years of regret never quite left her, no matter how many times she tried to let go. In her mind, the blame for their loss always circled back to her.

When the Ellis business had been booming, her parents, Wilson Ellis and Tessie Ellis, had spent more time in boardrooms than at home. Neighbors raised her, and their own house became little more than a layover between trips.

School was brutal. Kids pointed out her parents' absence like it was a badge of shame. Even when Spencer defended her, those words still left scars. A quiet resentment lingered in her heart.

One evening, right before her eighteenth birthday, frustration spiled out in a shouting match over the phone.She begged them to come home. She even threatened she'd never forgive them if they didn't.

They never made it back. The accident claimed them both.

She wasn't given a chance to say goodbye. The wreck left nothing for her to remember them by except grief.

The Ellis fortune collapsed soon after. The relatives she once saw at every holiday began to keep their distance, leaving her isolated and adrift. Spencer's parents were halfway across the world and couldn't come back to help..

Rodger was the only one who stood by her, arranging the funeral, making sure she finished school,and helping her piece together some sort of life.

Gratitude for Rodger ran so deep that even if Julian had never entered the picture, she would have called Rodger family.

Lost in memory, she didn't see Julian bend down to set the flowers by the stone.

He gazed at the names, his words steady and sincere."My name'sJulian Powell. I'm Yvonne's husband.I should've come sooner, and I promise to look after her from now on."

For a brief moment, Yvonne saw him as the only bit of hope breaking through the sorrows.
###Chapter 64 Keép Up


Julian lingered with Yvonne a little longer, letting her voice fill the quiet air while he mostly listened, at rare moments showing his astonishment with a fleeting spark in his eyes.

At her parents' gravestones, Yvonne spoke only of the bright moments in their marriage,painting pictures of laughter and small joys while leaving all the shadows unmentioned.

She recounted everyday details-incidents so minor Julian had long forgotten-but in her telling, they sounded like priceless keepsakes she had been guarding in her heart.

Julian's gaze grew more complicated the longer she spoke, and for the first time, he truly grasped how much he had overlooked her in the past.

As they made their way back to the car, silence settled between them. They walked under the same umbrella, yet the only rhythm was the soft crunch of their footsteps on the wet path.

Just before they reached the cemetery gates, Yvonne suddenly halted. With a wistful curve of her lips, she looked at him and murmured, "Thank you-for what you said in front of my parents, and for being here with me today."

Even if Julian hadn't truly meant those words, Yvonne still felt grateful he had spoken them. She couldn't bear the thought of her parents, even in death, believing there was no affection left in her marriage.

When she offered him only formal gratitude, Julian's brows drew together. That wasn't what he'd wanted.His words hadn't been meant to earn politeness-he had wished to see her smile at him again, as she once had,without hesitation or guarded distance.

His fingers pressed a little tighter against the umbrella's handle, though his expression stayed cool."Don't mention it. You played along for my grandfather's sake-consider this my way of paying you back."

The remark pierced her more than she cared to admit. So, as she had expected, his kindness had been nothing more than a gesture for the sake of the dead. Lowering her gaze, Yvonne hid the sorrow in her eyes, unwilling to let him glimpse how much his indifference still wounded her.

Moments later, they had crossed the gates of the cemetery and reached the car. Julian held the door open,his voice gentle but firm. "I'll drive you back to the Powell estate. You need to rest."

Yvonne hesitated, her hand lingering on the door frame. Her lips pressed into a thin line. "Can't we wait a few days? I don't have the energy to pretend in front of Rodger right now."

His expression shifted, the light in his eyes hardening, Leaning down, he braced one hand on the door,the other on the roof, effectively caging her in.

With his face close enough that she could feel the weight of his gaze, Julian's voice dropped, rough and edged with danger. "So you despise me that much now? You can't even bring yourself to pretend anymore?"

Back then, returning to the Powell estate had been Yvonne's happiest moment. She would lean into Rodger's approval, cling tightly to Juian's arm, and flash him a radiant smile, brimming wwith pride and contentment.

Was it really possible for love to vanish in a heartbeat?

The thought struck Julian with a dull ache, and he searched her face, silently begging for her to deny it.

Instead, Yvonne turned her head, deliberately avoiding his gaze. Her voice was cool, almost detached."We're about to divorce. There's no point in discussing this anymore."

She pushed him back. "Weren't we heading to the Powell estate? Let's go. I'm exhausted-I need to rest."

Julian staggered back, momentarily disoriented. Yvonne slid into the car, adjusted the seat with a faint scrape, then pulled her coat over her face, shutting him out completely as she drifted into sleep.

The cozy hush of the car surrounded her, pulling her into a deep sleep. When her eyes·fluttered open again,the car was still gliding smoothly down the road.

Somewhere along the ride, the coat slid off, leaving her uncovered beneath the muted glow of the dashboard lights. Yvonne turned her head, catching a glimpse of Julian's sharp profile-his jaw set, his focus absolute, every line of his face strikingly handsome in the muted light.

For a heartbeat, she let her gaze linger on him in silence.

The car began to slow, rolling to a gradual stop. Without glancing back, Julian's deep voice cut through the quiet, carrying a tone of cold certainty. long as this marriage hasn't ended, you'll keep up the act. You'll make everyone believe you still love me."

Only then did he turn to face her, his expression resolute, his words firm and commanding. "Exactly as you did before."

At his words, Yvonne's teeth sank into her lower lip.
###Chapter 65 Stay-at-home Husband


In the lush garden, Rodger reclined in a rocking chair, swaying gently as he immersed himself in a book.

A fluffy white puppy, tongue hanging, frolicked around him in playful circles.

Julian had informed Rodger ahead of time that he and Yvonne would be visiting the Powell estate today, and he had already brought Snowy along.

Rodger sipped his coffee, then leaned down to scoop the pup onto his lap, and said with a warm grin,"You're an absolute delight, little one. I can't wait for the day Yvonne and Julian give me a great-grandchild to cuddle!"

"Rodger..." Yvonne's voice carried a hint of fond exasperation as she stepped into the garden, arm linked with Julian's. Her eyes widened briefly at the sight of Snowy, her grip on Julian tightening.

It hit her instantly-Julian had made all the arrangements, even bringing Snowy, without consulting her.

Still, she swallowed her irritation, keeping up the facade of a devoted couple.

Julian felt the sudden pressure on his arm and glanced at her, his throat bobbing as he opened his mouth to speak, but Yvonne had already released him.

Smiling, she approached Rodger and began massaging his shoulders gently. "How are you feeling today,Rodger?"

"Better than ever. Seeing you two works wonders on me,"Rodger replied, humming contentedly as he closed his eyes.

Yvonne's gaze drifted to the book in his hands, and she shook her head slightly, almost imperceptibly.

The title read, "Strategies to Strengthen Marital Relationships."

Glancing at the table, she spotted more books with titles like "Enhancing Connection for Young Couples"and "Fostering Intimacy in Modern Relationships". Her cheeks flushed as she quickly averted her eyes, hesitating before asking, "Why are you reading these books?"

Julian's attention shifted to the stack, his eyes narrowing. A faint crack appeared in his usual calm, and he nearly reached up to pinch the bridge of his nose.

With surprising agility for his age, Rodger snatched a newspaper and draped it over the books. Smiling brightly, he sidestepped the question. "How long are you two staying? Is there anything you need? I can have it arranged."

Julian's brow furrowed as he noticed the unusual quiet of the estate. "Grandpa, where is Dario? And the rest of the staff? Why is no one around?"

Dario Mason, the ever-present butler of the Powell estate, was nowhere to be seen.

Rodger arched an eyebrow, sipping his coffee with deliberate calm. "I gave them all a week's leave. They've been working hard,you know."

Julian and Yvonne froze, their faces mirroring disbelief. "Then who is handling the cooking and cleaning?"Julian asked, incredulous.

Rodger's tone was light, almost playful. "That would be you, my boy."

"Me?" Julian, rarely rattled, pointed at himself, stunned.

"I've read up on the latest trends. Stay-at-home husbands are all the rage. I'm going to shape you into a stellar husband, son, and grandson over the next seven days!" Rodger said with a gleam in his eye.

Julian pinched the bridge of his nose, exasperated, and turned to leave.andpa,I've got the company to run.I can't stay."

He couldn't just abandon the Powell Group's business, which was worth tens of billions, to play as a stay-at-home husband. To him, that would be utterly crazy.

But before he could take a step, Rodger's measured words stopped him."I've already-cleared it with the board. You're working from home this week." Julian spun back, a sigh escaping as he prepared to argue the sheer lunacy of it. Just then, a pink apron flew toward him.He-caught it reflexively, his lips twitching as he registered what it was.

Rodger's grin was mischievous. "I'm hungry. How about you get started on dinner? Yvonne and I are eager to taste your handiwork."
 ###Chapter 66 Sparks Of Love


The moment struck Yvonne as almost funny enough to make her laugh aloud. Still, wary of giving herself away,she stifled the laugh before it surfaced.

It was the first time she had seen Julian so utterly disarmed, robbed even of the ability to argue.

The rare image of him cornered brightened her mood instantly, and she eagerly echoed Rodger's words,nodding as if she were genuinely looking forward to the outcome.

In truth, what she anticipated wasn't tasting Julian's food but watching him fumble through the cooking process.She already knew the truth-his previous attempts had been disastrous, his dishes barely edible.

Julian caught their exchanged looks, the amusement in Rodger's voice, and the sparkle in Yvonne's eyes.With a sigh of resignation, he understood there was no way out this time. Yet strangely, when he noticed the glimmer of delight in her gaze, his resistance softened.

He slipped the pink apron over his broad shoulders, its cartoon cat face glaringly out of place on him, and stepped into the semi-open kitchen. The gleam of utensils lined up before him made him pause,wondering where to even begin.

Julian's idea of cooking amounted to tossing ingredients into a hot pan and hoping for the best. The array of polished tools laid out before him felt less like utensils and more like riddles he couldn't solve.

From the doorway, Yvonne rolled Rodger closer, the old man's eyes alight with mischief. "Yvonne, aren't you going to give him a hand?" he teased, his grin daring her to step in.

The kitchen, narrow and faintly scented with soap and spices, seemed exactly the kind of space where books claimed romance could bloom.

Yvonne lingered for a beat, then sighed softly and slipped inside.

Julian stood at the counter, frowning at a potato as if it had personally betrayed him. Three different peelers lined the board, each one an enigma. Why on earth did a simple potato need three separate tools? Just as his confusion deepened, a slender hand reached past him. Yvonne's voice, low and patient,brushed against his ear. "This one's for peeling, that one slices thin, and the last cuts it intochunks."

With those words, Yvonne slid the potato from his hand and began peeling in steady,quiet strokes.

Julian leaned closer, watching intently. Her lashes lowered in concentration, shadows softening her face wrapping her in a calm, almost delicate grace. Her slender fingers moved with practiced ease, ribbons of skin curling into a neat pile until only a smooth, clean potato remained.

She finally lifted her gaze and inquired,"Should I cut it into chunks?"

The question hung in the air just as he dipped his head. Their noses brushed in the faintest touch, a fleeting collision that startled them both into stillness.

For a suspended heartbeat, neither spoke.

In the kitchen, the most unexpected moments always had a way of unfolding.

Their hearts thudded like drums, pounding in a shared rhythm that blurred into one furious beat.

Yvonne broke first, retreating in a flurry of motion, her hands fumbling for another potato as if peeling it could mask the heat in her cheeks.

Julian coughed lightly, masking his own unrest, and reached for a second peeler, slicing into the potato he'd already stripped bare.

With their backs turned toward Rodger,Yvonne kept her gaze lowered and murmured in a voice meant only for Julian, "I think he's onto us. Why else would he suddenly start reading those books?"

Her suspicion seemed to explain everything-Rodger's careful stage-setting, the contrived chances for them to linger close, the intimate atmosphere he kept engineering around them.

Julian's voice dropped to a quiet murmur. "You're right."

For all his brusque manner, Rodger noticed everything. From the instant he suggested they linger at the Powell estate, Julian had understood the deeper reason. He never called it out, though.Maybe he hoped that by playing along, he might rebuild the bridge between himself and Yvonne.

That thought clouded his eyes. With a sudden sharpness in his voice, he remarked, "If that's true, then we'd better throw ourselves fully into the act, so Grandpa won't doubt us."

"What do you..." Yvonne began, but the words stuck in her throat. Her eyes flew wide as the potato and peeler slipped from her hands, the potato thudding softly against the floor.

Her palm pressed to the counter, her fingertips flexing and curling as if deciding whether to let go. Just then, a broad, steady hand slid over hers, threading their fingers together, holding her fast.

Julian eased back just enough for her to draw a shaky breath, then closed the distance again, deepening the kiss with sudden, unyielding intent.
###Chapter 67 Necessary Kiss


Rodger lingered at the doorway, making Yvonne wary of resisting too hard. She subtly pressed her palms against Julian's chest and hissed under her breath, "What on earth are you doing?"

"Quiet." Julian's thumb brushed over her lips, silencing her. He bent closer, his voice a hushed breath against her ear. "'Grandpa's watching."

The heat of his words grazed her skin, raising goosebumps along her arms. Her fingers clenched reflexively,and she forced down a nervous swallow. "Even so, you had no right to kiss me like that."

He eased back just enough to meet her gaze, his tone calm but firm. "It wasn't for me-it was for him. If we look swept up in each other, Grandpa won't question a thing."

Yvonne's eyes darted toward the doorway, catching sight of Rodger's wide, satisfied grin.

Julian cupped her cheek lightly, his thumb grazing the warm flush there. A teasing glimmer lit his eyes."That blush of yours is impossible to miss."

Mortified, Yvonne pushed him away, her ears burning hotter by the second."Fine then-cook by yourself!"she snapped, flustered, before hurrying off.

Julian watched her retreat, lips curving into an amused, knowing smile.

Not much later, a strange scorched smell began to waft through the villa.

Yvonne's nerves tightened-this wasn't just making toasts anymore. Was Julian about to set the place on fire?

Right as her worry spiked, her phone buzzed with a message from him. "Dinner's ready."

Was it possible he'd really managed to make a meal?

Still doubtful, she headed for the dining room. The table was neatly set, complete with four dishes and a soup. But the food itseIf looked like a catastrophe-some parts were scorched black, others dyed with unsettling colors. No matter how carefully it had been plated, none of it looked safe to eat.

Rodger's mouth twitched as he took in the sight. Then, with a dramatic slap to his forehead, he groaned,"Ah, I just remembered! I have an invitation for a game of chess. I'm terribly late-don't bother waiting for me to eat!"

Without another glance, he wheeled himself out at surprising speed.

Rodger's sudden exit left Yvonne sighing in disbelief. She still couldn't wrap her head around how easily he'd slipped away.

Her gaze drifted to Julian, who sat stiffly with his lips pressed into a thin line, his expression shadowed with the awareness of how disastrous his cooking truly was.

An unexpected flicker of sympathy rose in her chest. Not wanting to crush what pride he had left, she pulled out a chair and settled at the table.

Casting her eyes over the bizarre spread, she searched for the faintest silver lining before finally blurting out, "Well... it's certainly something."

Julian's stare pinned her in place. "You mean that?"

The question tightened around her like a trap. For a moment, she was back at the memory of choking down his meal, reminding herself that this situation wasn't all that different-and maybe, just maybe, she could endure it again..

Holding onto the thought, she lifted a slice of potato, paused wit it in her fingers, then quietly set it back down.

Looking for a distraction, she inquired, "Where are Jordy and Sharon?"

Rodger might have excused the servants, but surely he couldn't have dismissed Julian's parents as well.

Jordy's absence made sense-being a chief diplomat, he spent much of the year overseas-but Sharon was another matter. She was supposed to be home.

Julian hesitated, then replied in a low voice, "Dad's away on business. As for Mom... Grandpa sent her and Aunt Nadine on vacation about a month ago."

In other words, Rodger had spent a month planning this down to the last detail.

Yvonne pressed her fingers to her forehead, torn between marveling at Rodger's scheming and being stunned that he had discovered their discord an entire month ago.

Julian's eyes flicked to the potato slice left on her plate, his voice tinged with expectation. "Why aren't you eating?"

Caught off guard, Yvonne forced herself to lift the piece and chew. Her face puckered almost instantly in sheer distaste. "How can you still be this bad at cooking? It's just as bad as the toast disaster from before."

A flash of panic crossed Julian's face before he straightened stubbornly. "What toast? I never made you any."


Setting down her fork, Yvonne's lips curved with quiet amusement."Oh,come on. I don't know anyone else capable of making something this terrible."

Julian's expression darkened, his pride crumbling beneath the jab.
###Chapter 68 Test Results For The Medication


Julian's features hardened into a somber mask, though the flush of embarrassment still slipped through.

For as long as he could remember, he had chased excellence-always top of his class, always the genius others admired.

Yet here, at the simplest tasks of the kitchen, he kept failing where others thrived.

After a beat of silence, he forced steadiness into his voice, as though reclaiming a fragment of dignity. "Next time,I'll make it better."

Cooking wasn't something that could be mastered in a single attempt. He believed that with repetition, with persistence,even this arena would eventually bow to him.

Without realizing it, he had already resigned himself to being the one who would cook for Yvonne in the days to come.

The corner of Yvonne's lips curved despite herself. She lifted another bite from the platter, only for Julian to intercept with a frown, his hand halting her midway. "Don't bother with that. I'll get Morton to pick up some proper food and bring it by later."

Yvonne ignored·his warning, chewing and swallowing without a flicker of emotion. Arching one brow, she quipped, "Well, it's not a total disaster-at the very least, the nutrition's balanced."

Julian's face twisted with a mix of pride and humiliation. He lowered himself into the chair, scooped up a bite, and forced it into his mouth. The bitterness made his brows knot instantly, but when he saw Yvonne eating as though it were a delicacy, he clenched his jaw and swallowed the mess instead of spitting it out.

By the time she set her utensils down, satisfied, Julian had already begun stacking plates. He carried them into the kitchen and calmly turned on the tap to wash them.

The light mood faltered a moment later when a sharp pang twisted in her stomach. She covered her mouth,retching softly, and the discomfort reminded her she couldn't forget her prenatal supplements. She cast a glance toward the kitchen, where Julian was still wrestling with the dishes, before slowing her steps. Pouring herself a glass of water, she discreetly pulled a pill bottle from her bag, tipped a few into her palm, and swallowed them with a careful sip.

Relief washed over her at the thought of Rodger granting the servants a week off. With fewer eyes in the house, the chances of anyone noticing her medication-and letting it slip to Rodger or Julian-were slim.That would have been far too troublesome.

The moment she turned, she was struck motionless. Julian stood in the doorway, pink apron still tied around his waist, dishwashing gloves dripping with suds, his gaze locked on her.

Startled, Yvonne instinctively tucked her bag behind her and forced a nervous laugh. "All done in there?What brings you out?"

"I was going to ask what happens if I use too much soap..." His voice was quiet, though his eyes were fixed on the pill bottle sitting openly on the coffee table.

His expression darkened slightly as he asked, "You're on medication? What kind is it?"

Caught off guard, Yvonne realized she had hidden her bag too hastily-the medicine bottle still sat exposed.

She snatched it up, her pulse quickening, and when she caught sight of the harmless vitamin label, a wave of relief steadied her nerves. Trying to look casual, she gave the bottle a little shake. "Vitamin C. Is there a problem with that?"

Julian stayed silent, his eyes locked on her with unnerving intensity. The heat of his stare unsettled her, and she instinctively looked away. Her throat tightened, but she forced out a light cough before murmuring, "I'm exhausted. I'll get some rest now."

Without waiting for a reply, she spun around and made for the stairs, her steps quick and unsteady,betraying the edge of panic clinging to her retreat.

Julian's suspicions solidified-the bottle had to contain something far more serious than Vitamin C.

He tugged off the sudsy gloves, pulled out his phone, and immediately called Morton.
When the line clicked alive, his voice was clipped and icy."Morton, are the lab results for that medication back yet?"


"Mr.Powell, I was just about to update you," Morton answered promptly."The tests finished a moment ago-I've already sent the report to your inbox."

Julian ended the call without another word. Opening the fresh email, he scanned the report, his expression hardening as a shadow settled across his eyes.
###Chapter 69 Save Rita


The test results confirmed it was nothing more than a standard bottle of vitamin C.

Julian stared at the report again and again, unwilling to accept it, yet the undeniable truth weighed on him like iron, leaving no room for doubt.

His gaze drifted to the upper corner of the page, where the doctor's signature read Rich Thorpe. The name rang faintly familiar, but he brushed it aside.

Setting his phone down, he pressed his fingers to his temples, trying to ease the dull ache spreading through his head. Was he letting paranoia get the better of him?

Just as the thought crossed his mind, his phone lit up and buzzed insistently across the table.

The screen displayed a name he hadn't seen in days-Rita.

Julian's frown deepened as Morton's earlier words replayed in his mind-Rita was supposed to be on a plane bound for Briysil tonight.

He lingered with the phone in his hand, debating; then finally accepted the call.

The instant the line connected, the sound of Rita's terrified sobs pierced his ear. "Julian... help me.."she choked out, her voice breaking.

Chaos bled through the background-shouts, scuffling, the sharp clatter of something crashing. Her breathing came in jagged bursts before she dissolved into frantic cries. "The Hawthornes... they've found me.They want to-"

A strangled scream cut her off mid-sentence. In the next moment, only silence remained. The call had ended.

Julian's face darkened as he yanked off the apron and tossed it carelessly aside, then strode out with hard,resolute steps. inside the bedroom, Yvonne's nerves were taut, every muscle braced for the possibility that he might suddenly return and confront her about the medicine.

She lingered near the window, pacing in restless circles, until a sudden flash of headlights caught her eye-Julian's car shot out of the garage, speeding into the night.

Confusion flickered across her expression. Where could he be rushing off to at such an hour? Was it some urgent business matter?

She bit her lip, tempted to speculate, but quickly pushed the thought away. His absence, after all, was a relief.She had been racking her brain for a way to get him out of the house long enough for her to complete her prenatal routine.

Turning back into the room, she quietly locked thedoor, rolled out a yoga mat, and pulled up a guided video.Settling onto the mat, she exhaled slowly, finally free to begin her exercises in peace.

Her phone vibrated midway through, flashing a new message-an image.

The photo showed Julian, unmistakably, caught stepping out of his car in front of an apartment building.

Yvonne's chest tightened the moment she recognized the place. It was Rita's residence. So Julian had rushed out just to meet her?

Her heart sank, the weight of betrayal pressing down until she snapped off the soothing music in fury.

Even after drawing several deep breaths, the suffocating ache wouldn't lift. Only when her abdomen cramped faintly did she force herself to le go of the spiraling thoughts. She switched the track to a cheerful children's song instead, trying to ease the tension in her body and comfort the little one inside her.

Meanwhile, Rita stubbed out her cigarette in haste, tousled her hair until it looked wild, and squeezed drops into her eyes until they were red and glassy. To seal the act, she pinched her thigh hard enough to summon hot tears that rolled freely down her cheeks.

Before long, the sound of steady footsteps echoed in the hall beyond the apartment.

Julian reached the door, its latch half-open. His brows drew tight as he strode in. The sight that greeted him made him halt-an unconscious man in black sprawled across the floor, while Rita huddled in the corner of the sofa, shivering, her fingers white around a small can of pepper spray.

The moment she sensed movement, she flinched sharply and raised the spray, but when her blurred vision caught Julian's face, her body sagged with sudden relief.

A sob broke free as she hurled herself against him, her voice breaking with pitiful desperation. "Julian,you're finally here to save me... I thought I'd never get out of this alive!"
###Chapter 70 Stay


Julian shifted slightly to the side, letting Rita stumble forward and land right into Morton's arms.

Morton caught her in an awkward embrace and asked, "Ms. Adams, are you hurt?"

Heat rushed to her cheeks-embarrassment mixed with irritation-as she bit down on her lip and turned toward Julian,who was crouched beside the unconscious intruder.

Annoyed, she brushed Morton away and drifted toward Julian, her posture trembling, eyes brimming with tears.

"When I came back today to pack, I felt someone lurking inside," she whispered, her voice fragile."Trne moment I stepped in, he lunged at me. Luckily, I had pepper spray on hand."

Her lip trembled as she spoke, her gaze fixed pitifully on Julian as if pleading for comfort.

Julian appeared blind to Rita's performance, his attention fixed on the unconscious man sprawled across the floor.

Grinding her teeth, Rita forced herself to keep playing the victim. "It wasn't untiI afterward that I learned he was carrying a Hawthorne family token..."

Right then, Julian pulled a badge from the man's pocket. An iris-shaped crest glinted under the light-the unmistakable mark of the Hawthorne family.

His features stiffened, a shadow crossing his face in an instant. Without doubt, it was the emblem of the Hawthorne family. He recognized it instantly, recalling the same badge Liam had owned.

Catching sight of the discovery, Rita let her tears spill faster, her voice shaking with dread. "They've tracked me down, Julian! You know what kind of man Grayson is-he'll never let me walk away alive."

Annoyance flared in Julian's eyes. Rising to his feet, he stated in a glacial tone,	"One man doesn't mean much. If they'd uncovered the truth, they wouldn't have sent him alone. Stop working yourself up." Rita shook her head in desperation and flung herself at Julian, clinging to his waist. This time he wasn't quick enough to sidestep. His brows drew tight as he tried to pry her hands off, but she only gripped him more fiercely.

"Julian, I'm only safe if I stay by your side. You can't send me to Briysil. They'll ambush me on the way and kill me-and the baby!" she begged, her voice breaking.

He studied her with a deep frown, the possibility already gnawing at him. Still, he had given Yvonne his word that he would deal with Rita, and he had no intention of breaking that promise.

With a steady hand, he pried her arms loose, his tone calm yet unyielding. "Grayson won't uncover the truth.I have spread fake information about your pregnancy. Even if he learns about it, he'll assume it happened after Liam's death. He won't imagine the child belongs to Liam."

Rita jutted out her lip in wounded defiance, poised to argue again, but Julian rubbed his temples with weary impatience and cut her off. "If Briysil terrifies you that much, then find another place to stay. I'll assign bodyguards to keep you safe."

Rita's eyes brightened with a sudden glint of hope. She held to the belief that being by Julian's side stil gave her a shot.

Pretending to hesitate, she pressed the matter further. "But what about the film I've been working on?"

Julian let out a.dry laugh. "Do you really want to make yourself easier to find by parading under the spotlight?"

Her chest tightened with panic. If the project collapsed, she'd be forced into obscurity, and all her careful maneuvering would collapse with it.

Tears welled up as she stammered, her voice breaking, "But this is everything l've worked for. Liam promised I'd become an international star... Julian, I swear I'll be careful. And aren't your men here to keep me safe anyway?"

Julian's patience thinned as Rita dragged Liam's name into the conversation once more. Affection had limits, and while he had no intention of abandoning her safety, the endless clinging wore him down. His mind wandered briefly to Yvonne, left alone at home-was she overthinking in his absence?

He cut the discussion short. In his eyes, he had fulfilled his duty to Liam. With a voice as cold as steel, he declared, "Do whatever you want. If filming matters that much, then keep at it."

Rita's face brightened instantly, delight spilling across her features. She reached for his arm, her voice sugary with adoration. "Julian, you're always so kind to me..."

But he swiveled away without hesitation, sidestepping her grasp. His gaze landed on Morton, and his order came clipped and cool. "Take care of this mess."

Morton gave a sharp nod as Julian strode toward the door and vanished without a backward glance.

Left behind, Rita sank her teeth into her lip, frustration simmering beneath the smile she forced onto her face.

She refused to crumble. After all, she had managed to stay in Kumvine-her foothold was secure, and she wasn't about to let it slip.
###Chapter 71 Went Back


It was deep into the night when Julian finally returned home. The villa stood hushed beneath the nightsky,its usual hum of servants gone, Rodger's retreat to bed left the corridors draped in a hushed, almost otherworldly silence.

When Julian spotted the bedroom light glowing softly through the crack in the door, the sharp edge of his weariness dulled. That simple warmth washed over him, smoothing away the day's irritation and replacing it with a rare comfort.

For once, he even felt grateful for Rodger's arrangements-grateful for the quiet life they'd carved out here.

After their painful time apart, he had come to understand how precious it was to return home late and find someone waiting, a lamp still burning on his behalf.

He eased open the door. A cheerful nursery rhyme floated through the air, light and playful against the stillness.

Yvonne, dressed in fitted yoga clothes, had slumped against the bed, her chest rising in steady rhythm,already surrendered to sleep.

Julian silenced the music with a brush of his hand, then leaned over to tuck a blanket around her shoulders.A faint smile tugged at his mouth as he studied her peaceful face.

It amused him to discover that Yvonne's bedtime music had shifted to lullabies.

A faint fuzz shadowed her otherwise smooth cheek, and Julian felt a ripple stir through him. Watching her sleep, he thought Yvonne looked as gentle and innocent as a baby.

Almost without realizing it, his hand lifted, fingertips grazing her face in a tender stroke. The skin beneath was soft and warm, a sensation that lingered pleasantly against his touch.

She twitched at the tickle, her brows knitting briefly, yet she didn't wake. Instead, she-reached out in her sleep, tugging Julian's head into her arms as if cradling something small, her fingers ruffling his hair. With a drowsy murmur, she whispered, "Snowy, don't be naughty."

He stiffened instantly, completely at a loss, caught against the warmth of her chest.Awkwardness tightened his breath, but he dared not move, letting her mistake him for that mischievous puppy as her hand drifted lazily over his hair again and again.

Only after a long stretch did Julian manage to shift carefully, adjusting his body until he had her tucked securely in his embrace. With a steady, soothing rhythm, he patted her shoulder, settling into the familiar comfort of holding her close.

Yvonne instinctively nestled closer in her sleep, and the two drifted through the night tangled in each other's arms. She slept straight through until daylight poured across the room, nudging her awake.

Stretching lazily, her hand brushed against something firm. Her thoughts stalled as she twisted around, only to find Julian's chest exposed beneath the loose collar of his pajamas, his muscles stark against the morning light.

The sight left her breathless, her head light and her heart racing. Dazed, she lifted her gaze to meet Julian's.He was propped on one elbow, watching her with a quiet smile curving his lips.

"Good morning," he murmured, his voice low and warm.

Yvonne blinked, still stunned. "Why are you here?" she asked, confusion lacing her tone.

Hadn't he spent the night with Rita?

Yvonne's thoughts churned, unable to make sense of it-he didn't look as though he had just slipped back home at dawn. Could last night's photo have been nothing more than another one of Rita's calculated tricks?

Julian, oblivious to the suspicion flickering in her eyes, assumed she was still foggy from sleep. He drew her against his chest again, his lips brushing close to her ear as he murmured, "What do you feel like having for breakfast?"

The warmth of his breath skated across her skin like a spark of static, sending a shiver racing down her spine. Flustered, she stammered, "A-anything's fine." With a small nod, Julian slid out of bed, and soon the steady hiss of running water drifted from the bathroom.

Yvonne remained a little disoriented, almost certain she hadn't yet woken from a dream.

When had things between her and Julian shifted to this kind of ease? They looked every bit like a long-married couple, steady and affectionate.

The irony wasn't lost on her-they had been separated, divorce proceedings already in motion, yet here they were, playing the role of a perfect pair for Rodger's benefit.

And now, with Rodger not at the scene, Julian still kept up the act. Wasn't he taking his performance a bit too seriously?

She dragged a hand over her face, pushing aside the jumble of thoughts clouding her mind, and swung her legs out of bed.

There was no time to indulge in confusion. After reassuring Rodger today, she still had to return to the office and endure the covert stares, the sharp gossip, and the constant scrutiny waiting for her there.
###Chapter 72 Improvement


The clatter of cooking utensils drifted from the kitchen, but unliké yesterday's frenzy, the rhythm now was calm and steady.

When Yvonne came downstairs freshly dressed, she spotted Julian still moving about in the kitchen while Rodger sat at the dining table, half-hidden behind his newspaper.

"Good morning, Rodger," she greeted warmly, sliding into the chair across from him.

"Good morning!" Rodger replied with a broad grin. He flicked a quick glance toward the kitchen, then leaned closer, lifting the paper like a shield as his eyes twinkled with mischief. "So... did you sleep well last night?"

Under his watchful eye, Julian and Yvonne found themselves compelled to share a bedroom. To him, there was no question they'd surrendered to a night of burning passion.

Yvonne's smile faltered, her expression tightening at the question. She couldn't very well confess that Julian had slipped out the night before and that she had fallen asleep without knowing when he had come back.

"We..." Yvonne faltered, her voice catching as she searched for a way to continue.

Before the silence grew too heavy, Julian emerged from the kitchen balancing a tray, sparing her the effort.

He set three plates on the table, each one holding a fried egg so oddly shaped and jagged it looked as though it had barely survived the pan.

The sight drew a muffled laugh from Yvonne, her shoulders shaking.

Julian's mouth tightened, his gaze dropping, shadowing his eyes as he caught her reaction.

Snapping back into composure, she straightened and said with deliberate sincerity, "You've really improved.At least this time they're not charred."

Rodger gave a slow, deliberate nod, mumbling loud enough to be heard, "And at least they don't look deadly." Then,flashing Julian an encouraging grin, he added in a booming voice, "Keep practicing. You'll be amazing at this before you know it."

Yvonne nodded with a spark of eagerness, fully agreeing.

Regarding his attempts at cooking, Julian could only put up with their playful taunts quietly-after all, the teasing came from the two people he cared about mnost.

With a faint sigh, he turned back toward the kitchen, returning with a glass pitcher of mmilk.right, let's eat already."

Both Rodger and Yvonne nodded dutifully, lifting their utensils. For a while, the dining room filled only with the soft scrape of knives and forks against porcelain.

Whether Julian had truly improved or frying eggs simply left little room for disaster, the meal turned out surprisingly palatable.

Yvonne cleaned her plate quickly, even finishing off her milk with a satisfied tilt of the glass.

Across from her, Julian displayed his usual precision-methodically slicing the misshapen egg into tidy squares and eating each piece with composed elegance. When he was done, he reached for the napkin folded neatly at his side and dabbed at his lips with practiced care.

A low grumble escaped from Rodger before he could stop himself. "What a strange little habit."

Julian went rigid, a faint flush creeping up his neck, and carefully set the napkin aside before glancing at Yvonne. "I'll take you to the office later.

Playing the part of a flawless husband, he couldn't allow her to head out alone. Yet beneath the facade,reluctance gnawed at him. After nearly drowning, even if her body seemed intact, the mental scars had to run deep. She should have been resting, not rushing back to deadlines.

Still, Yvonne had been adamant about returning.

Was it just dedication to her career? Or was she pushing to secure that five million faster,so she could end their marriage? The thought sent a chill across Julian's features, his expression hardening.

Not knowing what ran through his head, Yvonne assumed Julian's coolness came from the pressure of keeping up appearances for Rodger by driving her to work.

A faint unease stirred in her-she wanted to insist she could handle the trip herself, but Julian didn't leave room for protest. He gathered the plates and disappeared into the kitchen.

Rodger's gaze shifted between them. He sensed a tension, a subtle shift in the air, though moments ago everything had seemed perfectly smooth.

Choosing not to meddle, he cleared his throat and offered a cheerful grin."Yvonne, I'm heading out to play chess. Don't forget to come home early and cook tonight's dinner!"

Without waiting for her reply, Rodger made his escape, leaving behind a silence that seemed to stretch across the dining room.

When Julian returned from the kitchen, only Yvonne remained. Their eyes met briefly before darting away,the air thick with awkwardness until Julian finally spoke, his voice even but firm."Wait for me in the garage." ###Chapter 73 Scald Ointment


Down in the garage, Yvonne glanced at her phone, uncertainty swirling inside her. Julian had promised to drive her, yet he still hadn't shown up.

She debated sending a message to let him know she could manage alone, but before she could decide,Julian emerged. Sharp in a tailored suit, he carried a lunch box that looked out of place in his hands.

Without meeting her eyes, Julian handed her the box. "Lunch. After work, wait for me. I'll come pick you up."

For a second, Yvonne just blinked, caught off guard by the gentle command. She tried to lighten the mood,teasing, "You're really getting into this husband role, aren't you?"

Sure, the act was for Rodger's benefit, but his thoughtfulness seemed a little too real. It was almost as if Julian had forgotten where the performance ended.

Instead of answering, Julian simply pressed the car key, the doors unlocking with a brisk"beep." HHe pulled the door open for her and kept his words simple. "Hop in."

Lowering her eyes, Yvonne hesitated. Her gaze drifted to Julian's hand resting on the door, something about the gesture making her pause.

Julian watched her, a puzzled look flickering across his face when she didn't move. She pressed her lips together and murmured, "Give me a second."

Without another word, she darted away, returning a moment later, a little breathless as she slid into the passenger seat. "Alright,we can go now."

Julian shot her à quick look but didn't ask about her brief detour. He turned the key, started the engine, and the car glided forward in silence.

For most of the ride, Yvonne stared at her lap, lost in a maze of thoughts.

The warmth he showed unsettled her, tangled further by the anonymous photo from the night before-proof he had gone to see Rita.

A dozen questions hovered on her tongue. Should she just come out and ask where he'd been? Did she even have the right to ask?

Her mood sank under the weight of it, and heaviness pressed down on her chest. She barely noticed when the car coasted to a stop at a red light.

Julian finally broke the silence, his voice steady. "I'll have Morton send you the film proposal this afternoon."

Julian's words reminded Yvonne of the promise he'd made about a new project-something she'd almost dismissed as empty talk.

The seriousness in his tone caught her off guard. After a pause, she whispered, "Thanks for remembering."

Inwardly, she found the whole thing strangely ironic. He hadn't confronted the real source of the trouble,yet he could spend his evenings with Rita and still toss her a small token as if it would make up for everything.Was she really supposed to be grateful for that?

Another thought cut through her-maybe Julian's eagerness to hand her a project was nothing more than a way to speed up her earnings, so the five million would be repaid quickly and the divorce could come sooner.

With doubts swirling, Yvonne's mid drifted toward the bleakest scenario. Her heart tightened, and a quiet,slightly bitter laugh slipped out before she could stop it.

Julian glanced her way, a frown drawing his brows together. Quickly, Yvonne turned away and rolled the window down, letting the morning breeze dry her eyes.

When the signal changed, the car rolled on.

She rested her head against the window, thankful Julian didn't press for an explanation. If she was honest,he probably didn't care enough to ask.

Rush hour in Kumvine clogged every street, but Julian still managed to get her to the company just in time.

She insisted he stop short of the entrance. The last thing she wanted was colleagues spotting them

 together and spinning rumors.

When the car came to a halt, Julian glanced over as Yvonne unfastened her seatbelt, ready to leave.He opened his mouth to say something, but she moved first, placing a small item in his palm.

"Take this. It's scald ointment. Don't forget to useshe said, her voice low and sincere.

His hand twitched back in surprise. The burn on his skin came from frying eggs that morning.

When had she noticed it? Was that why she had rushed back earlier?

The look on his face must have betrayed him, because Yvonne quickly averted her gaze, her tone clipped.

"Don't read into it. I just don't like owing anyone," she explained.

Before he could respond, she shoved the door open and slipped out.

Julian sat back, watching her retreat with hurried, uneven steps, her unease plain even from behind.Lowering his gaze, he studied the ointment.in his hand. Slowly, the corner of his mouth curved into a faint smile.
###Chapter 74 His Lies


The moment Yvonne stepped into the office, an icy wave of unease swept over her. Eyes followed her from every corner, sharp with judgment, some openly mocking, others dripping with contempt.

She tightened her grip on her purse and quickened her stride toward her desk, but the spiteful whispers still threaded through the air. It was plain they weren't hiding it, speaking just soft enough to sting while lettíng the gossip seep into every corner of the office.

"Did you hear? Someone here's flaunting her affair right under the wife's nose."

"Unbelievable, isn't it? She made the husband forget his wife and whisk her off in public. That bitch knows what she's doing."

"No wonder she managed to become the mistress of a wealthy guy. She's got schemes stacked higher than anyone else."

"And even if she served those tricks to me on a silver platter, I wouldn't touch them.I've still got more shame than she does."

Laughter rippled through the office, sharp and mocking, while Yvonne stood frozen in place, eyes shut tight,forcing herself to steady her breath.

Trevor had warned her this would happen-that once she returned, every stare would rip her apart,every whisper would hit like a fist.

She also understood that even if she shouted the truth-that she was Julian's lawful wife and Rita was the interloper-no one would buy it. They would dismiss her as hysterical, accusing her of spinning delusions.

Drawing in a slow, controlled breath, she willed herself to tune out the voices as she crossed back to her desk.She had to stay composed--for the fragile life quietly taking shape inside her.

But fresh cruelty trailed after her. Two employees sauntered past, lowering their voices just enough for the barbs to land. "I heard they dumped her fromn the 'Cold Summer' crew without a second thought. They're filming nonstop now while she's stuck here, useless."

"That's what she gets for whoring around as the mistress. If she didn't have that affair to lean on, the company would've tossed her out long ago."

"Cold Summer" had been the project Yvonne was attached to.

Hadn't that production already been scrapped for lack of funds? Why was it suddenly back in full swing? A flicker of confusion crossed her face, but she disguised it by fussing with her desk.

Only then did she notice the surface was bare-her laptop and bag were still at the filming site.

Since most of the production had been based in the neighboring studio, she decided to head over and retrieve her things.

To her astonishment, the set was still alive with activity, cameras rolling as though nothing had ever been halted.

Stepping inside, she was greeted by Rocco's booming voice echoing through the space. His words were sharp,slicing through the air as he berated a trembling young actress for screwing up her movement.

Tears streaked the young actress's face, and then a lilting, almost languid voice cut in, "Rocco, don't waste energy on this. Just blur her out in the background later. Let's keep filming."

The speaker was a woman in full costume, her makeup flawless, perched like a queen amid a retinue of attendants. One fanned her with a paper fan, another dabbed her lips, a third held out a water bottle. Dark-suited bodyguards in mirrored sunglasses stood nearby, forming a wall of silent intimidation. The entire scene radiated the aura of a star.

Rocco's fury vanished in an instant, replaced by a wide, eager smile. "Couldn't agree more, Rita! No need to waste time on extras. We'll move on immediately!"

Frozen at the doorway, Yvonne felt her complexion drain of color.

The same suffocating pressure she'd felt beneath the water days ago closed around her chest again, choking the breath from her lungs.

Julian had sworn that anyone who wronged her would face consequences, and he had promised Rita would never stand in her way again.

Yvonne had assumed he would at least ship Rita overseas to stay out of sight for a while.

Instead, only a few days later, he had rushed off to meet Rita in the dead of night, and now, here Rita was-parading around the set as if nothing had happened-working openly on the very project Julian once claimed he had shut down.

His so-called compensation project was nothing more than a diversion, a convenient excuse to keep her occupied while concealing the truth.

Realizing this, Yvonne let out a hollow laugh, her chest tightening. She had been nothing more than a pawn,strung along and deceived by Julian's carefully woven lies.

###Chapter 75 Home-wrecker


Caught up in her thoughts, Yvonne barely noticed when someone brushed hard against her shoulder,making her stumble and almost lose her balance.

The passerby turned quickly as if to apologize, but the moment they recognized her, their face twisted with contempt.

"Why are you here? Looking for more trouble?" the passerby sneered.

Yvonne's gaze flicked toward Rita's set. Cameras were already rolling and nobody seemed to care about her.She lowered her eyes, keeping her tone steady. "Just picking up something I left. I won't be long."

"Then grab it and get out. You're nothing but bad luck," the person muttered, throwing curses over their shoulder as they walked awvay.

Yvonne's fists clenched at her sides, but she swallowed her frustration. She understood their hostility. Her reputation had been shattered, and her earlier misstep had nearly derailed the entire production. The resentment from the crew was only natural.

The last thing she wanted was to watch Rita flaunt her triumph. The smartest choice was to take her bag and leave as quickly as possible.

But when she entered the lounge, the bag she had left behind was nowhere to be found. Clearly, someone had moved it.

At that moment, the door opened, and a man stepped in-a colleague she recognized from the set.

Keeping her tone polite, Yvonne approached him with a small smile."Callum, I left a bag here earlier, but now I can't find it. Do you know where it went?"

Callum Ashton, responsible for logistics, had a reputation for being timid and soft-spoken, rarely raising his voice to anyone. Yet when his eyes landed on Yvonne, something cruel sparked in them, as though he had finally found someone weaker to trample.

"Oh, look who it is-the famous home-wrecker. Still got the guts to show your face here?" he taunted, voice dripping with mockery. "You must be desperate for attention, crawling back in like this. Some nerve you have."

Yvonne's jaw tightened. She shot him a cold look. "That's enough."

He flinched but puffed himself up quickly, barking, "Who do you think you are, talking tough? Aren't youjust selling yourself? If that's the case, why not sell to me-"

The words were cut short by the crack of a slap ringing through the room. Yvonne's hand trembled faintly,but her voice was cold, saying, "Keep your mouth shut, or you'll regret it."

Panic flashed across Callum's face. He clapped a hand to his cheek and bolted from the room, yelling down the hall, "Mr. Duncan! That troublemaker's at it again!"

Yvonne shut her eyes for a moment, weariness sinking into her bones.

All she wanted was to collect her bag quietly. Why did they all need to grind her down just to puff themselves up?

The shout carried far, and soon the lounge door burst open, revealing Rocco with several crew members trailing behind.

Whispers spread quickly, heads bent together, and even without hearing, Yvonne knew the gossip was about her. A dull irritation gnawed at her chest.

Rocco spat on the floor, anger twvisting his features. "What the hell are you doing here, Yvonne? Isn't it enough that you almost tanked my entire production? I nearly lost my funding because of you!"

Steadying herself, Yvonne forced a breath. "I'm just here to find my bag. I'll be gone as·soon as I have it-"

Rocco sneered, exposing his stained teeth. "What's so important, huh? The whole movie nearly went up in smoke just because you batted your eyelashes at the right man. If you want something, why not go beg your sponsor? Women like you always find the shortcut. Directors like us work our fingers to the bone, kissing up to sponsors, and you-just a wink and a promise, and you're set for life."

His words set off crude laughter among a few of the men, while most of the women exchanged uneasy looks.

Yvonne's expression iced over, her gaze locking on him with quiet fury.

Then,out of nowhere, an object came flying, striking her forehead and making her stagger back in shock.

The sting bloomed slowly, the pain delayed by the surprise.

In the restless crowd, there was no way to know who had thrown it. But the noise swelled quickly, voices layering over one another.

"Yvonne, youI shameless home-wrecker, get out of here!"

"Leave the company!"
###Chapter 76 A Naive And Easily Deceived Fool


The mob pressed forward, faces twisted with malice, their voices rising in unison like a rehearsed chant demanding Yvonne's exile from the company.

She backed away instinctively until her shoulders bumped against a corner piled high with abandoned props and clutter-no room left to retreat.

"I'm not a home-wrecker..." Her protest barely escaped her lips before the roar of jeers smothered it, her words swallowed whole by the frenzy.

At the edge of the crowd, Rita lingered like a queen surveying her stage. Arms folded across her chest, she wore a triumphant smirk, her eyes gleaming with satisfaction.

Standing off to the side, Rita drank in every detail-Yvonne's face ashen, a thin line of blood sliding from the cut at her brow, her figure pressed against the wall like prey cornered by predators.

The sight was pitiful, almost humiliating, and it thrilled Rita beyond measure.

At first, she had fretted over how to gloat-how to remind Yvonne that not only had she evaded consequence but had strutted right back into the spotlight, resuming her work without pause.

Fate had spared her the trouble. Yvonne, battered and defenseless, had stumbled straight into her humiliation.

When Rita had reappeared on set, whispers of doubt shadowed her presence. Yet once Julian's bodyguards stationed themselves around her like an impenetrable wall, the crew no longer questioned her position.In their eyes, she had secured the role of his legitimate wife.

This round belonged to her.

After basking in the spectacle long enough, she finally stepped forward, slipping into the guise of a merciful savior. With false tenderness, she said, "Don't hold it against Yvonne. I've already let it go..." "You're too generous, Rita! That rotten slut ought to be condemned to hell!"

"That's right! Shame on that damn homewrecker!"

As the insults piled up, no one noticed the flicker of unease on Rita's face when the word"homewrecker"was spat with such malice.

Then came Yvonne's laugh-low, jagged, and mocking-slicing through the air like broken glass. She fixed her gaze on Rita, her blood-streaked face ghastly beneath the trickle that blurred her vision, making her look terrifyingly unbroken.

Yvonne swayed on her feet but still advanced, closing the distance between herself and Rita with two unsteady steps.

"The real shame is the woman who knowingly steals someone else's place. Rita, why don't you enlighten everyone here-who's the true homewrecker?" she spat, her lips curling into a bitter sneer.

A shadow of fear flickered across Rita's expression before she instinctively recoiled, her heel scraping against the floor as she stepped back.

Before Yvonne could press her point, a hard shove sent her stumbling backward.

"What do you think you're doing?!" a voice shouted, thick with accusation. "Trying to attack Rita now?Everyone knows you're the mistress! Don't fool yourself-screwing around with Mr. Powell won't raise your damn status. He only gives a damn about Rita!"

The speaker jabbed a finger toward the suited men looming behind Rita. "Look at them! Those bodyguards were assigned by Mr. Powell himself to protect her-because of people like you!"

As heads around her nodded in agreement, Rita regained her composure, slipping back into a soft, pitiable demeanor. "Yvonne, I know it's hard for you to accept, but Jules doesn't belong to you. Please stop clinging to him,alright?"

Her shameless performance made Yvonne's chest burn with anger, yet beneath it throbbed a raw ache.

The bodyguards standing behind Rita were unmistakably from the Powell family. Considering the hell Rita had dragged her into, it made no sense that Julían gave Rita bodyguards.

The irony twisted so sharply that Yvonne actually laughed out loud.

Every sneer from the crowd suddenly rang true--Julian only cared about Rita. The fleeting happiness she had tasted these past few days hnad been nothing more than Julian's carefully spun illusion. And she had been foolish enough to believe it, to imagine-just for a moment-that he might have cared for her, even a little.

Reality had slammed her back into clarity with merciless intensity.

In Julian's world, she was nothing more than a gullible fool, easy to placate and easier to deceive.

Yvonne shut her eyes, the sting of blood seeping into them at last making itself felt. She forced her tears back,steadying her breath.

"I've never wanted to steal from anyone," she said, voice trembling with restraint."A∥I want is to take back what belongs to me and walk away."

That was all she had asked for from the start-her own things returned. Yet they clung to her, dragging open old scars, forcing her humiliation again and again.

Out of nowhere, a bag hit the floor at her feet, the impact scattering its contents. A laptop skidded out,its screen shattered into a spiderweb of glass.

Callum's smug voice rang out, sharp and mocking. "Take it and get the hell out of here!"

Yvonne's vision flared red with fury. She shot him a glare that cut like a blade.

The very next second, a fist slammed across Callum's face with brutal force.
###Chapter 77 Hold Back


Callum's scream tore through the set as his body hit the floor and skidded a few feet away. Blood spilled from his lips, and panic flickered in his eyes when he realized one of his teeth had come loose.

Rage boiling over, he pressed a trembling hand to his jaw and shot a murderous glare at his attacker. "What gives you the right to hit me, Trevor?!"

With a cold stare, Trevor flexed his fingers, unmoved. "You brought this on yourself."

That day's filming had been split across two sets. Braden, the male lead, braved the outdoor shoot under Trevor's lead, while Rita, unwilling to endure the rough conditions, chose to perform against a green screen indoors.

If Trevor hadn't doubled back for the gear he forgot, Yvonne might have been cornered once again, just as she had before.

Callum,all bravado vanished, hunched his shoulders and stayed quiet. He never picked fights with anyone stronger,

Rocco's brows knitted in disapproval as he snapped, "Trevor, that's crossing the line. You're just being a bully now!"

Hearing that, Trevor let out a dry laugh. "Funny. When Yvonne was surrounded and beaten, not a single word left your mouth.Where was your outrage then?"

Murmurs and uneasy glances rippled through the crowd. Rocco looked ready to explode, and Rita worked up a glistening tear, all wide-eyed and tragic.

"Trevor, you've got it wrong," she murmured, putting on a fragile act.vonne upset everyone. They only defended me..."

"Cut the act. Do you think I'm blind? You shameless-" Trevor's poatience snapped, and-the truth trembled on his tongue. But just before he spat out the word "mistress," Yvonne reached for him and shook her head Baffled, Trevor clamped his jaw shut, still simmering, but respecting her silent plea.

His near-slip, however, made Rita's stomach chum. She cast a nervous glance at Yvonne, dread twisting inside her. Had Yvonne already told him everything?

Murmurs rippled through the onlookers. Their gazes darted between the two women, restless and curious.What secret had Trevor nearly revealed? And what exactly was Yvonne hiding?

Nobody said a word. Every person in the room seemed lost in their own tangled thoughts, and the tension thickened.

Yvonne finally broke the silence by turning to Rocco, her tone gentle but firm. "Mr. Duncan, you know as well as I do that if Julian hears about what happened here, nobody will come out of this looking good. I told you already. I only came to collect my things. Once I've got them, I'll be gone, and you'll never have to see me again. Doesn't that work for you?"

Weighing his options, Rocco's expression darkened before he gave a grudging nod. "Let's get back on track, people. Enough standing around."

With the spark of conflict gone, the crowd wasted no time scattering. Callum tried to blend in and slip away,but Trevor's sharp voice cut through the shuffle. "You. Hold it right there."

Callum froze mid-step, forcing a wobbly smile that only drew more attention to the gap in his teeth.there something else, Trevor?"

Trevor pointed to the busted laptop on the floor. "Breaking someone's computer and walking away? Not happening. Either you pay for the damage, or I get the police involved."

"Trevor, please! Ms. Ellis,it was an accident! I barely make enough as it is. Please, let me off the hook this once!" Callum begged, bowing low, his voice breaking with desperation.

He remembered sneaking a peek at that laptop earlier. With that brand-new logo and sleek design, it probably cost more than half a year's wages. Exhaustion drained Yvonne's voice as she muttered, "Let it go. I just want to be done with this,"

Relief flooded Callum's face, and he stumbled over his thanks.

Trevor snapped, irritated, "Then get out of here before I change my mind!"

Callum bolted, and the set grew quiet again. Trevor turned and caught sight of Yvonne crouched down,gathering the scattered things from her bag. His expression hardened as he crossed the floor and bent to help.

"Why didn't you tell them the truth? Thnat Rita's the mistress and you're Julian's wife?" His confusion seeped into his sharp tone.

Yvonne hesitated, her hand hovering over the scattered items. She let out a hollow laugh."Mho would even believe me if I did?"

Somehow, even to herself, it always felt like Rita fit the part of Julian's wife better than she ever could.
###Chapter 78 Quit


Standing outside the film site, Yvonne turned to Trevor with a faint, grateful smile. "I appreciate you stepping in, but please hold back next time. It'll only damage your reputation."

Everyone on set already branded her the other woman, her name smeared beyond repair. If Trevor spoke up for her, he'd be crushed under the fallout with her. This was the reason Yvonne had held him back from telling the truth.

No matter how many explanations she gave, the verdict was already written-she was the other woman. To their eyes, Trevor was nothing more than her friend, and his defense would be brushed aside just the same.

Trevor gave a casual shrug, his expression as unbothered as ever. "I couldn't care less what people think.I'm not planning to stick around here anyway."

"What?" Yvonne's voice wavered, trying to keep up with what he had just said.

Trevor shoved his hands deeper into his pockets, tilting his head back so the sunlight spilled across his face as he squinted with lazy ease. "I've decided-I will no longer work with Rocco."

The words dropped as lightly as if he were commenting on the weather.

Yvonne's jaw slackened in shock, and for a moment she had no words. When she finally looked down, guilt tugged at her voice. "I'm truly sorry. You wouldn't have lost your job if it weren't for me..."

Trevor groaned dramatically, rolling his eyes, "Lost my job? Listen carefully.I kicked Rocco out!"

He tossed his head with a sharp laugh. "His so-called artistic vision is a nightmare. Everything he directs turns into trash, and being forced to film that junk day after day was driving me insane, you get me?"

When Yvonne's guilt lingered in her eyes, Trevor dragged a hand through his hair and added more sincerely,"I've been itching to quit for a long time. My team already clashed with him on a past project. This director switch got dumped on me last minute, and the contract locked me in. But I can't stand it anymore. This isn't on you-none of it." Yvonne's voice wavered as she pressed."What about the penalty for breaking the contract?

Her lashes trembled as she dared a glance at him.

From her perspective, the photography team put in the most effort for the smallest gains, scraping by on modest paychecks.Trevor had never struck her as wealthy. If he walked out now, the penalty would be crushing.

Almost unconsciously, she began calculating how much she could contribute, already weighing how far her savings could stretch to help cover the cost.

Yet Trevor only shrugged, unfazed. "That penalty's nothing to me. Worst comes to worst, l'll just head back and run the family business."

Her brows shot up. "Family business?" she echoed,startled.

He dipped his chin in an easy nod, then let out a low laugh. "You didn't actually think I was broke, did you?"

Yvonne had, in fact, always assumed he came from. a modest background. His scuffed jeans and constantly half-lidded eyes radiated a lazy,carefree energy that fit the picture of a struggling artist she had painted in her mind.

Watching her stunned expression, Trevor broke into loud laughter, doubling over as though the whole thing was a joke at her expense.

Straightening with a wide grin,he announced,"My family owns a pretty profitable mining business. Not quite on the scale of the Powell Group, but I've never had to worry about money."

Her lips parted in a small, disbelieving"oh," which only seemed to fuel his delight. "We even have a jewelry venture with the Powells. I'll pick out a massive diamond for you one day," he teased, eyes sparkling."

"Then how did you end up in photography?" Yvonne blurted,still baffled.

To her, mines and cameras belonged in entirely different worlds.

Dropping his gaze, Trevor replied in a languid drawl, "It's my passion. I've loved it since I was a kid. My parents hated it, thought I was throwing my life away, and tried to drag me back into the family business.I couldn't stand it, so I ran off to chase the life I wanted."

His expression soured, brows knitting as he added with disdain, "Didn't think mny first gig would be with someone as brainless as Rocco. Working with him has been a nightmare."

Yvonne's lips curved into a softer smile, the heaviness in her chest easing."So what's next for you? Don't tell me you're really going back to run the family business."

"Not a chance." Trevor tipped his head back, shielding his eyes with a hand while grinning toward the horizon. "My team and I are heading out to Uglana. We'll be filming the great animal migration. Far more exciting than putting up with some idiot director who doesn't know shit."

Her laughter slipped out, warm and genuine. "Then I.hope the wilderness treats you well. Good luck out there."
###Chapter 79 Budget


City towers loomed overhead, casting deep shadows across the pavement as Yvonne lingered beneath the glass front of TR Entertainment, giving Trevor a quick wave before he headed off.

She already knew her days at TR were numbered after everything that went down, but the deal with Julian still hung over her like a cloud. Figuring out how to quit gracefully weighed on her mind.

Just then, fortune gave her a nudge-Morton's familiar face appeared beside a parked car. He stood waiting,clutching a document bag and grinning like he'd just spotted an old friend.

Her eyes brightened instantly-inside that bag had to be the new project Julian promised. No matter how chaotic things got, Julian always followed through on his word.

With this project in hand, she could focus on one thing-earning as much as possible and finally walking away from her marriage.

Money held a special kind of magic, so she put on her brightest smile and strode right up to Morton.

"Have you grabbed lunch yet, Morton?" she asked, voice light.

Morton looked momentarily flustered, shifting from foot to foot before giving a sheepish nod. The truth was,she wasn't particularly interested in his answer.

"Good. Then let's head into that café and talk," she said, already walking toward the doors

Once inside, Yvonne ordered a coffee for herself and nothing more. She leaned back in her chair, her gaze settling on him. "You've got the film proposal, right? Hand it over."

Morton's eyes flickered with faint disappointment when he realized she wasn't ordering him anything. Still,he pulled the thick file from his bag and slid it across the table.

"Please review it, Mrs. Powell. If everything looks good, we can sign today," Morton said.

Yvonne met his words with an easy smile, imagining how smoothly this partnership could go. Flipping open the cover, she paused at the first page. The synopsis gripped her at once, and excitement flickered in her chest. For a split second, the resentment she held against Jufian faded. Maybe he did havea conscience, after all.

Each new page pulled Yvonne deeper into the story, leaving her more and more impressed.

This script didn't just have an original concept and a unique voice. The screenwriter's craft shone through,every line of dialogue ringing true and full of meaning. With the right team, she pictured this film breaking the box office wide open-maybe not just five million, maybe it could even crack a hundred million.

Nothing else in the proposal raised concerns either. For once, Julian had delivered something worthwhile.

Closing the folder with anticipation in her eyes,she leaned forward toward Morton."So tell me, what figure is Julian setting aside for me?"

She wasn't aiming too high. Since Julian never blinked at dropping a hundred million on Rita's projects,Yvonne figured she could reasonably expect at least a chunk of that. She would handle the film personally,keep costs low, and make sure Julian got his money's worth.

But when Morton met her hopeful stare, his gaze faltered, and his chin dipped toward the table.

Her smile wavered, stiff at the edges. She pressed her lips tight and asked evenly, "What is it then, ten million?"

Ten would be manageable. She would cast for skill instead of names. With a strong script as its backbone,audiences would come as long as the acting wasn't dreadful.

Morton slumped even further, and with a nervous hand, raised two fingers.

Her eyes narrowed, disbelief hardening her tone. "Two million?" Her teeth ground together as she spoke.

How could Julian splurge endlessly on Rita, only to pinch pennies when it came to her?

Even so, two million could be stretched. She had allies in the industry, and with enough bargaining and ruthless trimming, she might still scrape by.

But Morton's head shook again, and her expression chilled to stone. The thought struck her instantly-Julian was making a mockery of her.

In a tiny, shaky voice, Morton finally said,"It's two hundred thousand."
###Chapter 80 Refusing To Give In


"Just two hundred thousand?!" Yvonne couldn't keep the shock from her voice, her eyebrows climbing as she echoed the number. "You're serious about this, Morton?"

Her glare could have frozen him where he sat, as if his answer would seal his fate.

Morton looked utterly troubled, clearly wishing he were anywhere else. "Please, Mrs. Powell... don't vent your anger on me. The figure came straight from Mr.Powell."

When he'd first heard the budget, even Morton could hardly believe it. He'd double-checked with Julian more than once, but the answer never changed.

Deep down, Morton suspected Julian was deliberately setting a trap for Yvonne. He had never wanted to be the bearer of such news, but when the secretarial staff caught wind of the budget, they vanished one by one, leaving him cornered. Flimsy excuses and nervous flattery had pushed the job into his reluctant hands.

That thought made him grit his teeth. Everyone else just ran for cover!

"What am I supposed to film with that? Two hundred thousand wouldn't even cover a weekend shoot! ls Julian playing some kind of joke on me?" Yvonne exploded, slamming her hand on the table as she leapt to her feet, fury radiating from her.

The outburst jolted Morton upright as well, trembling under her wrath.

"Mr. Powell said-he hopes you'll treat this as a learning experience..." he stammered, voice barely above a whisper,repeating Julian's excuse word for word.

Of course, he knew what Julian was really after. That five-million-dollar wager loomed large, and Julian was ensuring she couldn't reach her goal too quickly, let alone walk away with a divorce settlement. But instead of speaking the truth, Julian played games, leaving him stuck with the dirty work.

To Morton, his boss was impossible to deal with sometimes. Morton kept his frustration buried, fully aware that meddling in his boss's private life was forbidden territory.As a seasoned assistant, he wasn't stupid enough to cross that line.

Masking his thoughts, he slipped on a courteous smile. "Mrs. Powell, even if the funds are tight, Powefl Group can offer every other kind of support. I'll help you find the most affordable sites-anything you need,just let me know."

Rage burned through Yvonne as she forced the words out between clenched teeth. "Thank you for this 'generous' offer!"

Morton's head dropped instantly, shame coloring his face. "You... you don't have to." His mind scrambled,desperate for a way to soothe her temper.

No matter how he looked at it, he couldn't help but feel he'd drawn the short straw. Delivering bad news made him an easy target, and he knew Yvonne would always link him to this pitiful budget. Offending her was the last thing he wanted.

Suddenly, her phone vibrated on the table, slicing through the tension. One look at the screen made her scowl deepen. She answered, though clearly not happy about it.

Brock's grating tone buzzed from the other end. "Yvonne, word is you stirred up trouble on set today.I expect an explanation, or else-"

The line went dead before he could finish. Yvonne ended the call without hesitation, her eyes hardening as she turned back to Morton. "I want out of TR Entertainment. Can that be arranged?"

A bead of sweat rolled down Morton's temple. Deep inside, he was amnazed that Julian had already guessed she would say this.

From his file bag, he drew out another folder, a sleek key, and a plain black card.

"Mr.Powell thought you might feel that way," Morton said, voice respectful."If you don't want to work under Brock, he's arranged for you to head your own department. This has the details about your new office."

Yvonne took the documents, narrowing her eyes in suspicion. The office was in the same building as TR, right in the bustling heart of the city where property prices scraped the sky. The office wasn't a corner suite though-it spanned the entire top floor.

She almost laughed at the irony. Stingy with the film budget, yet extravagant everywhere else-that was Julian all over.

"So, Mrs. Powell, are you going to sign the contract?" Morton hesitated, sliding the contract across the table.

Yvonne pressed her lips together, snatched a pen from her bag, and scribbled her signature with a force that left an impression on the paper.

Julian might throw obstacles in her path, but she would never bow to them.
###Chapter 81 Exclusive Elevator




Once Yvonne handed over the signed contract,Morton nearly sagged with relief. A sigh slipped out,so heartfelt he almost looked misty-eyed, silently thanking Yvonne for ending his ordeal.


Finally, he felt free from the burden of this impossible assignment.


"You won't have to worry about rent. The Powell Group owns the whole building," Morton said,managing a genuine smile. "If you run into any roadblocks, just give me a call."


He then offered his thanks with sincerity and hurried off with his copy before Yvonne could change her mind.


As Morton disappeared, a wave of frustration settled over Yvonne. She leaned forward, resting her forehead on her palm as she glared at the contract,feeling like she'd just been expertly outmaneuvered. Two hundred thousand-barely a fraction of what a third-rate star pocketed for a single day's shoot. How was she supposed to cast anyone decent with that?



Amateurs, perhaps. Yet turning amateurs into capable actors would cost her more time than she could afford.



The thought made her exhale heavily, a muttered curse for Julian echoing in her mind.



But what good was cursing? She had taken the challenge, and the only path forward was to fight her way through it.


By the time she gathered herself, dusk had already fallen. Rising to her feet, she stretched out the stiffness in her limbs and started back toward the company.


Julian might have given her a department of her own,but currently she still worked under Brock. Unlike Trevor, she couldn't simply walk away. She might have to avoid crossing Brock before her resignation. But luck wasn't on her side. The instant she stepped into the lobby, she spotted Brock in heated conversation with another employee. She angled her body, hoping to slip by unseen, but his eyes snapped to her at once.


His face twisted with anger, and he barreled toward her. "Yvonne! You dared to hang up on me? Do you realize the chaos you've caused today? You-"


"Step aside. You're in my way." Yvonne barely paused, her voice chilly and unbothered.


The blunt dismissal left him speechless. He turned to the employee nearby, asking in shock and disbelief,"Did she just dismiss me?"



The employee nodded silently, and Brock's face flushed with anger. By the time he spun back around,Yvonne was already striding to an elevator where nobody waited.


Brock burst out laughing, disbelief written all over his face. "Really, Yvonne? You think you're taking that elevator?" Yvonne stopped in her tracks, turned with measured calm, and asked, "Is there some sort of issue?"


A ripple of surprise moved through the group gathered by the other elevators.


"Hasn't anyone told her that elevator's off-limits?What's she doing over there?"


"Probably because she's disliked by everyone here.I heard she..."


While whispers spread, Brock folded his arms and sneered. "That's the private lift straight to the penthouse. You need a special access card for that one. Even our boss doesn't have that kind of clearance."


Yvonne tilted her chin, gave a brief nod as if considering his words, then resumed walking.


The sight made Brock's smirk falter. He sneered to cover it. "Unbelievable. Do you really not know your place? Let me spell it out-this whole tower is Powell property, and Rodger once declared the top floor belonged only to his granddaughter-in-law."


The truth hit Yvonne like a slap. So that was what Rodger left for her. Anger flared in her chest. She saw right through Julian's scheme- claiming Rodger's gift as if it belonged to him.


Meanwhile, Brock continued his tirade, "Doesn't matter how close you are to Mr. Powell, he'd never let the likes of you-"


He never finished the thought. Yvonne had already reached the elevator, pulled a sleek black card from her bag, and tapped it against the panel. A soft beep sounded.The doors slid open.


Brock was frozen to the spot, mouth hanging open,unable to process what he'd just seen.


Gasps rippled through the crowd, wide-eyed disbelief written on every face.



Stepping inside, Yvonne turned at the last moment. A sly smile touched her lips as she addressed the gawking onlookers. "By the way, that top floor? It's my new office."
###Chapter 82 New Office





Brock's gaze fixed on the elevator as it climbed out of sight, and the whole group stood there, baffled.


"Can you believe Yvonne actually used that exclusive elevator?" said Brock,his voice laced with disbelief.


His assistant let out a bitter laugh. "That woman knows how to twist people around her finger. Mr.Powell is so wrapped up in her charm that he can't see straight anymore. Poor Rita doesn't stand a chance."



Those words jolted Brock back to his senses. He slapped his forehead, furious that he had almost fallen for Yvonne's act. How did she even have the nerve to strut around like she owned the place?


The heat of his anger boiled over, dark thoughts flickering through his mind.


Turning sharply toward his assistant, he ordered, "Follow Yvonne's every move, and make her life as difficult as you can."


"Yes, sir," replied the assistant with a firm nod.


Meanwhile, the elevator doors slid open at the top floor, and Yvonne stepped out. One glance at the space around her eased the dissatisfaction she had been carrying.


There was plenty of room to move around, and the whole place was kitted out like a proper mini film studio-private offices and everything.


As she surveyed the setup, a nagging thought struck her. None of this could have been pieced together overnight.How long had Julian been planning this?


The more she wondered, the less she could make sense of his intentions.


With a small shake of her head, she brushed the question aside, opened the office door, and stepped in.


The design suited her taste perfectly. Clean lines,a genuine leather couch, matching armchairs, and a lush,pricey rug underfoot.


She sank her feet into the softness of the rug and let out a crooked smile.



Just looking around, Yvonne guessed the makeover alone cost more than two hundred thousand. For all she knew, Julian was either cutting corners on purpose or just giving her a hard time.


Running her hand along the polished desk, a half-crazy idea popped into her mind. Maybe she could dismantle the furniture and sell it off for cash.


That crazy idea fizzled just as quickly as it came.After the rough morning and a drawn-out spat with Morton over lunch, she hadn't eaten anything except for a sad cup of coffee. Right now, hunger was the only thing on her mind.


Yvonne sank into the sofa, the cushions swallowing her weight, and released a long breath of relief. If only she had something tasty to go with the moment,it would have been perfect. Reaching into her bag, she pulled out the lunchbox Julian had packed for her earlier that morning.


For a fleeting second, she thought him rather considerate. But once the lid flipped open, her mouth twitched, and that fleeting gratitude evaporated at the sight of a strange, unidentifiable mess staring back at her.


The dish looked like it had survived a disaster. She could not even guess what it was supposed to be,and she wasn't about to gamble her life to find out.



Somewhere in the chaos, she spotted what appeared to be beef tangled with limp broccoli.


At least Julian's mind for nutrition remained intact.Even if the meal itself looked like punishment, the balance of protein and vegetables was, in theory,spot on.


Her stomach gave a loud protest, forcing another sigh from her lips. Ordering delivery would mean discarding this untouched box, and that felt ungrateful in its own way. Finally, she steeled herself, speared a chunk of broccoli with her fork, and raised it like a soldier preparing for battle.


The taste nearly brought tears to her eyes. That was just awful. She had long given up on him mastering seasoning, but sweetness in broccoli? Had he truly mistaken sugar for salt?


By the time she forced the last bite down, nausea rolled through her. She shoved the lunchbox out of sight and drowned her misery with two tall glasses of water.


Right then and there, she swore she would convince Julian never to make her lunch again.


With the ordeal behind her, Yvonne swallowed her medication and curled back into the sofa, pulling out her work.


She knew there was no fixing things with Brock. The only path forward was carving out her own studio and producing a film with a two-hundred-thousand budget. It sounded like a fantasy, and reality pressed heavy against it. Soon enough, the medicine dulled her focus, and exhaustion swept her into a heavy sleep.


When her eyes blinked open again, the sun had already slipped away. Shadows draped the office,leaving the space hushed and unfamiliar. For a moment, she hardly recognized where she was.


Through the haze, she thought she saw a faint silhouette lingering in the dimness. The figure shifted, sending a chill up her spine. She clamped her eyes shut, her throat tightening as a scream threatened to break loose.
###Chapter 83 Explanation




Light flooded the room in an instant, and the shadow that had loomed nearby transformed into something familiar.


Julian stood there with his brows drawn together,looking faintly annoyed. "It's just me."


Yvonne's scream died in her throat, and then relief washed over her. With a quiet huff, she muttered,"What on earth are you doing skulking around here?"


There he was, perched in the dim office all that time,so it was no wonder she nearly jumped out of her skin.



"I came earlier this afternoon," said Julian as he approached, holding out a glass of water while his gaze lingered on her.


Her throat dry, Yvonne accepted it, taking a cautious sip. Behind the rim of the cup, she whispered, "Thanks."


Meanwhile, her mind raced with questions. He'd come earlier this afternoon? That meant he must have been watching her napping. What if she had mumbled in her sleep or shifted in some ridiculous way?


While her mind churned, he slid a small plate into view. A neat slice of cake sat on it, sweet and inviting.


Almost as though reading her confusion, Julian explained, "I only stopped by to bring this. You were sleeping,so I stayed busy with some paperwork."


The implication eased her nerves-he hadn't been putting all his attention on her.


She let out a breath she hadn't realized she was holding, then studied the cake with a strange mix of gratitude and hesitation.


After a quiet pause, she teased, "You'd make a decent househusband,you know." Never before would she have pictured Julian not only preparing food for her but showing up with dessert as if it were the most natural thing in the world.



The memory of his recent efforts made it difficult for her to cling to old grudges. Scooping up a spoonful of cake, she masked her unease with casualness and asked, "Doesn't this ever wear you down?"



It struck her as odd-a man as busy as Julian,pressured from every angle, still finding time to play the part of caretaker. Surely he must feel the strain.



"Of course not," Julian answered instantly, without the slightest pause.



Startled, Yvonne lifted her head, only to find his gaze already fixed on her. His eyes held a depth she couldn't quite unravel, layered with emotions he rarely let slip.



His voice dropped as he added, "I'm just trying to walk in your shoes, living the life you had for those three years." Her chest tightened, and a storm of memories crashed through her. She turned away, unwilling to let him see how shaken she was.


For three years, her entire world had spun around Julian. Her own identity seemed to dissolve as she existed only to meet his every need.


Mornings always began with her bustling in the kitchen, making breakfast he'd barely touch. Every day, she'd pack his meals and try to bring them to his office, but Julian never invited her upstairs. Morton was always sent down to collect them, and eventually, Morton-always polite-suggested she stop. The implication was clear: the meals never reached Julian and probably ended up tossed out.


The sting of it pressed hard against her throat, and she blinked quickly to stop the tears. Clearing her voice, she deflected with a question. "Why didn't you wake me when you arrived?"


Julian's lashes lowered as he murmured, "You finally looked like you were resting well." He remembered too well how easily her sleep could be disturbed. Even the slightest movement late at night would rouse her, no matter how quiet he tried to be.



So he'd left her undisturbed, selfishly enjoying the rare sight of her finally at ease. For once, he had wanted the afternoon to stay quiet.


A brief silence passed before Julian's tone shifted,tentative. "What do you think of this office?"


He almost sounded nervous, waiting for her approval.


Yvonne studied him, suspicion flickering in her eyes,then answered flatly, "It's not bad."


The faintest curve touched his lips, but he kept his expression guarded. "I'm glad. It was thrown together in a hurry, and plenty of things still need to be added."



Suspicion narrowed her gaze, and she studied him carefully. "So you're admitting you arranged this whole office for me?" A trace of panic crossed Julian's eyes, betraying him before he could compose an excuse.


The sharp crack of Yvonne's palm on the desk broke the moment. Her teeth clenched as she spat, "Don't pretend to be generous. Why don't you tell me the truth about that two-hundred-thousand budget?"
###Chapter 84 A Taunt





As she spoke, Yvonne locked her gaze on Julian's eyes, searching for even the slightest hint of unease or any telltale emotion.


But Julian's composure didn't waver. His face betrayed no guilt as he responded with calm sincerity, "I'm a businessman. Investments carry risks. Two hundred thousand is my most generous offer for this film."



"Are you saying I'm bound to lose money?" Yvonne shot back, her jaw clenched.



Julian's expression remained infuriatingly innocent his voice steady. "I didn't say that. But if you're intimidated, you could always back out now."



Yvonne took a sharp breath, fighting the impulse to fling the cake at him. Her words came out deliberate and firm. "I. Will. Never. Give. Up." Julian's eyes dropped briefly, a subtle smirk tugging at his lips. "I respect your determination. I'm eager to see your film come to life."


To Yvonne, his words felt like a taunt. Her anger surged, but she was powerless to lash out.


After a tense pause, she tossed the half-eaten cake onto the table in frustration and stood, her face icy."I'm done for the day. I'm heading home."


With that, she stormed out, leaving her bag behind.


Julian, unhurried, picked up the bag and trailed after her with a relaxed stride.



Yvonne rushed to the elevator, jabbing the button repeatedly. When the doors slid open, she darted inside and hammered the close button.



Just as the doors began to shut, Julian slipped in with effortless grace.


Still fuming, Yvonne turned her face away, refusing to acknowledge him. Yet Julian's presence filled the space. The crisp,woody scent of his cologne saturated the air, a constant reminder of how close he stood.



As the elevator began its descent, Yvonne's irritation grew. Thirty floors had never felt so endless.



The building hosted multiple companies, and during peak hours, most elevators were crowded. Yet here they were, alone in this one, the silence amplifying the sound of their breathing and the faint thump of their heartbeats.



Just as Yvonne's restlessness peaked, Julian reached toward her.



Startled, she flinched back, forgetting the elevator wall behind her. Pressing against it, she eyed him cautiously. "What are you doing?"


Julian stepped closer, closing the small distance between them, his gaze lowering to meet hers.Yvonne's pulse quickened, and she turned her head aside. If Julian tried to kiss her now, she wasn't sure she would push him away.


Her thoughts scattered as Julian's fingertip grazed the corner of her mouth, gently brushing something away. She swallowed hard, nerves tingling.


Before the sensation could fully take hold, Julian stepped back.


Yvonne stared, dazed, a flicker of confusion in her eyes.


Then she watched as Julian pulled a neatly folded handkerchief from his suit pocket, his eyes dropping as he carefully wiped his finger. Only then did he look up and say, "You had some cake on the corner of your mouth."


Yvonne's frustration surged, nearly choking her. How had she fallen for someone like Julian?



The elevator reached the ground floor just in time,sparing her further turmoil.


The moment the doors opened, she strode out, silently vowing that she would firmly resist his charm next time.


But in the next instant, she faltered, her resolve crumbling under the weight of his striking looks-the very thing that had drawn her to him.


Fuming, Yvonne quickened her steps.


Behind her, Julian followed with an amused, almost fond smile, shaking his head as he easily kept pace.


Unbeknownst to them, several onlookers in the distance quietly observed the exchange.
###Chapter 85 Flattery





Moments earlier, Rocco had wrapped up the day's shoot.


Despite calling it a shoot, the whole production felt more like Rita's personal showcase, with everyone orbiting her and letting her, a complete amateur,dictate every move. The script changed whenever she felt like it, tossed aside at her whim.


Nobody dared to push back or complain. Keeping Rita happy had become their full-time job. No one forgot what happened to the two actors who'd tried speaking up-they got bumped down to extras, not a single line left for them.



Rita strode into the underground parking lot, trailed by a pack of people eager to win her favor.


"You know, that line you rewrote today was brilliant,Rita. Best Actress this year for sure!" "No doubt about it! If this film explodes at the box office,the credit will all be yours!"


Rocco's expression tightened, and he gave a sharp,deliberate cough that silenced the chatter.


But Rita basked in it all, drinking in the praise as though it were gospel. She lifted her chin, lips curving into a self-satisfied smile, while she pretended at humilty. "Please, don't exaggerate.This film is a group effort."


"You're far too humble, Rita..."


Then a voice rang out, cutting through the fawning tones. "Wait, isn't that Yvonne? Who's that man with her?"



"It looks like the CEO of the Powell Group..."
(
The words faded away, and glances darted uneasily toward Rita.



Drawn by the whispers, Rita glanced in the same direction. Her grin faded in an instant,replaced by a stormy glare. Just a short distance away, Yvonne and Julian approached a sleek car. Julian moved ahead, opened the door for her with a slight bow, and motioned for her to get in.


Yvonne slid into the car, her expression frosty, never acknowledging Julian's gesture. Julian seemed amused, smiling to himself as he circled around and took the driver's seat.


Watching them, it was impossible to miss the air of casual intimacy, as if they were a couple with no idea the whole world was watching.


Julian and Yvonne gave no sign of noticing the stares aimed their way. The car engine growled, and within seconds they were gone, leaving only a haze of exhaust in the air.
(
Silence weighed heavily on the group. Rita's face remained stone still, and no one dared to speak.


"Unbelievable! Mistresses nowadays strut around like they own the world!" Rocco suddenly cursed,breaking the silence. His eyes darted to Rita's stiff expression, his voice rising with outrage. "You can't let this slide, Rita! Mr.Powell's just handing her everything on a silver platter. She even rode up in the private elevator that's supposed to be yours-the one for the Mrs.Powell! The nerve!"


Murmurs of agreement rippled through the others.


"That's it, Rita! She strutted around, telling everyone the top floor would be her new office. You should put her in her place!"



"Exactly! That space is yours, Rita. Are you really going to let her take it?"



"No way does Yvonne deserve that kind of treatment! It's yours, Rita, yours alone!"


The flattery swelled louder, drowning the air, but none of them caught the flicker of shame in Rita's eyes.



Rita curled her lips into a fragile smile and replied softly, "Let it be. If Julian wants her to have the top floor, fighting over it will only make me seem small.An office is just an office. If she wants it, then let her take it."



Her words were crafted to perfection-casting herself as generous while quietly painting Yvonne as greedy. Instantly, the crowd's sympathy deepened,and disdain for Yvonne multiplied. Their insults turned harsher, their loyalty to Rita firmer.


Behind that gentle smile, howNever, her jaw tightened until her teeth ached.


She flicked one last resentful look in the direction Julian and Yvonne had disappeared. Her hands balled into fists, nails biting into her palms,yet even pain could not smother the venom burning inside her.


Why was Yvonne, a woman with such a tainted name,allowed to snatch up everything she had been denied? That thought clawed at her, and she vowed in silence that sooner or later, it would all be hers to claim.
###Chapter 86 Personal Savings





Pulling up to the villa, the car rolled to a gentle stop.Yvonne sat rigid, her gaze locked on the scenery outside, lips pressed together in a silent protest.


A small smile tugged at his lips as Julian asked, "Are you still angry?"


Her head turned slowly, her eyes searching his. "Isn't there any room for us to negotiate about the budget?"


For a beat, he hesitated, then shifted his gaze aside with cool indifference, a gesture that only deepened her unease.


Yvonne's tone grew urgent as she continued, "Just think of it as a temporary loan. I promise,the moment this film turns a profit, you'll get every cent back!"


She had crunched numbers, trimming costs wherever she could, yet even then, filming with just two hundred thousand was a dream too thin to hold.Still,she refused to let the dream go.


Hope flickered in Yvonne's eyes as she looked at Julian. She had never once asked him for anything.But this time, she wanted his support.


For a moment, Julian's face gave nothing away.Eventually, he quietly undid his seatbelt, got out, and opened the door.


"Let me get dinner started. You and Grandpa can relax for a bit," he said, without glancing back.


Her heart sank, her body stiffening as she watched him walk away. Her teeth caught her lower lip,and disappointment filled her eyes until they shone.


Dinner that evening carried the weight of unspoken tensioh.


Yvonne could hardly bring herself to smile at Rodger.After forcing down a few bites, she laid her fork aside and rose to her feet. "I'm done."


Without waiting for a reply, she hurried upstairs. Another glance at Julian's face, and she feared she would burst, letting her anger spill in front of Rodger.


Julian didn't bat an eye,taking his time with his meal.


Rodger, on the other hand, looked ready to burst. HHis eyes darted between the stairs and Julian, mustache bristling, cane poised with indignation.


"You idiot! I gave you the perfect chance, and you still managed to drive her off again?" he snapped.


Though the cane never struck, it hovered threateningly, as though the next words out of Julian's mouth would decide if it came down.



Julian pressed his fingers against his forehead with a weary sigh, then gently guided the cane back to its place by the wheelchair.


"Grandpa, please trust me. Everything I'm doing is to keep Yvonne close," said Julian, his tone steady and sincere.



"Really?" Rodger's brows furrowed with doubt. "Really," Julian replied, his eyes calm and unwavering.


Eventually Rodger let out a heavy sigh, shaking his head. "Alright, I won't meddle in your business. But hear me, boy-if Yvonne ever walks away because you let her down, I'll be the one to make you pay!"


Back upstairs, Yvonne slipped into her room,quietly closed the door, and hurried over to her vanity. She pulled open a drawer and grabbed a small box.


Perching on the bed, she tipped the box over and watched a handful of bank cards and some jewelry scatter across the covers.



Giving up was out of the question. Even if it meant dipping into her own savings, she would see the film finished.



Being Julian's wife meant money was rarely an issue.In the last three years, she'd hardly stepped out or splurged, so Yvonne felt sure she'd built up a healthy sum. That confidence faded fast as she checked card after card, her stomach tightening with every low balance.


To her shock, all her liquid funds barely added up to a few tens of thousands.



Only then did the truth strike her-she had always been spending through Julian's supplementary card.


Living cushioned as a wealthy wife, she had never thought of saving, and so her funds were nearly nonexistent.


Regret pressed down hard, the weight of financial dependence suddenly unbearable.


The little cash she had couldn't carry the project, and her modest jewelry collection, never being one for extravagance, would barely make a dent.


Julian's refusal to support her left her at a dead end.Where else could she possibly find the money?


Her eyes fell on the supplementary card shoved into the corner of the box, and an idea sparked. Ever since asking Julian for a divorce, she hadn't touched the money in that account. Maybe he'd forgotten all about it.
###Chapter 87 Transaction Notifications





Soft light spilled from the study lamp as Julian hunched behind his desk, eyes fixed on a contract glowing across his laptop screen, fingers tapping out quick,scattered notes.


He had already finished washing the dishes, and instead of returning to the bedroom he shared with Yvonne, he lingered in the study. He knew she was upset, and if he went back now, their words would surely turn into another fight.


Rather than face her, he buried himself in work,waiting for the comfort of silence once she drifted off to sleep.


Out of nowhere, the phone beside him lit up, the screen flashing with a new notification.


He picked up the phone without much thought,scanning the screen. A frown slowly appeared on his face,confusion written all over his eyes. The alert showed a bank transaction. Five dollars had been spent through his supplementary card.


With so many zeroes in his accounts, a single-digit withdrawal leapt out at him, almost absurd.


His life as CEO of Powell Group meant most charges were hefty, usually five figures at least. Why would there be a purchase for just five dollars? What could possibly cost so little? Yvonne's doing?


The possibility pressed against his thoughts, and his frown deepened as he grew curious about what Yvonne had bought for that small amount.


He stared at the notification a moment longer before switching to the call screen and dialing Morton.


"Look into something for me right now," said Julian.(

In another room, Yvonne glanced at the confirmation message on her shopping app and let out a quiet breath of relief, knowing that the supplementary card still worked.


The purchase had been little more than a trial run, so Yvonne picked the first thing she saw-turns out she'd just bought a ridiculous pack of neon plastic bracelets.


Yvonne barely gave them a thought. Once she confirmed the supplementary card worked, her mind immediately shifted to how she could turn that access into real money.


Transferring the funds directly into her own account was impossible. Julian would see it instantly,and the card would be blocked before the transfer cleared.She needed a quieter way, something clever enough to slip under his notice.


An idea sparked, and her lips curved faintly. If she wanted real money, all she had to do was buy high-value goods and flip them for cash. Luxury items lost a bit of value when resold, but that hardly mattered-what she needed was liquidity.


Decision made, she wasted no time. Tapping through page after page of designer flagship stores, Yvonne started snapping up items with abandon. Meanwhile, Julian's phone vibrated nonstop, one transaction after another flashing across the screen.


He narrowed his eyes, watching the string of notifications mount. Just beneath them, Morton's message waited unread.



When Yvonne finally set her phone aside, a quiet satisfaction settled over her. Even with the expected dip in resale value, the haul should still net her over ten million-just enough to fund her ambitions.



The best part was that Julian would never suspect her. He had never cared about her spending habits,sometimes even sending luxury items home for her amusement. To him, it wvas just another way to keep her distracted.



She had never been drawn to extravagance, but tonight, her view had shifted.


With the financial knot loosened, her shoulders eased. She pulled out the film proposal and bent over the script with renewed focus. Snowy, sensing her good mood, shook out its thick fur and hopped into her lap, tail thumping as it nudged her hand.


She absentmindedly stroked its silky coat, and the little dog flipped onto its back, begging for belly rubs with eyes half-closed in contentment.


Soon, both Yvonne and Snowy were sprawled comfortably across the bed, each claiming half the space.


By the time the clock hands touched eleven,Julian assumed she had drifted off.Quietly, he opened the bedroom door, only to pause at the sight before him.


His gaze darkened. Snowy lay sprawled across the exact spot where he usually slept.
###Chapter 88 Rubbish Bin





Snowy sprawled on its back, paws in the air, when a sudden chill crept over the room and froze it in place.


Lost in her script, Yvonne flipped another page,only to notice a shadow stretching across the bed. She looked up to find Julian standing there, watching her.


His gaze narrowed and settled on Snowy. "It's getting late. Snowy shouldn't be in here. Put the dog back where it belongs."


Julian would never let the dog steal his spot on the bed.



Catching his meaning, Snowy gave a dramatic whimper and stared up at Yvonne with pleading eyes.


With a gentle smile, Yvonne scooped Snowy into her arms. "It's all right, sweet thing. You can stay with me tonight." Julian's jaw tightened. "If Snowy takes this bed,where exactly am I supposed to sleep?"


Snowy nuzzled closer to Yvonne, trembling as if it could feel Julian's icy glare.


Suddenly, Yvonne remembered that they were staying at the Powell estate-separate rooms weren't an option for Julian here.


Scanning the room, she pointed at the sofa. "That couch is free. Or you can take the floor if you're not picky."


His expression darkened instantly, and in the blink of an eye, Snowy was snatched from her arms.


Dangling by the neck, the pup whimpered, eyes wet as it reached for Yvonne with tiny cries that pierced her chest. She jumped up, trying to grab it back.


"Julian, what do you think you're doing? Stop scaring Snowy!" she snapped.


But his long stride kept him ahead, holding the dog out of her reach. With a stony face, he strode to the sofa,opened the ornate kennel, placed Snowy inside,and latched the door.



The little pup pawed and whimpered at the entrance,desperate to win some sympathy. Julian's stern look shut that down in an instant, and Snowy slunk back to its bed without another peep.


Seeing that, Yvonne's fury boiled over. "How can you be cruel to even a dog?"



Julian didn't flinch under the accusation. Instead, he strolled back to the bed at his own pace, stretched out his long frame, and casually claimed half the mattress. With one brow lifted, he said coolly, "I'm claiming my side of the bed."



"You're being completely ridiculous!" Yvonne snapped, her patience fraying.



Irritated, she grabbed for his pillow, though the gesture itself looked no different from the antics of a bickering child.



The moment her fingers brushed the pillow, his hand shot out and closed firmly around her wrist.


Startled, she jerked, trying to pull away. But a sudden cool weight pressed against her skin.


When she lifted her arm, an ice-blue diamond bracelet glittered there- the very one she had once thrown aside.


Her ears rang, a dull buzzing drowning out the room.She didn't know what game Julian was playing,but Rita's cutting words from that day came rushing back, mocking her own foolishness.


Yvonne's face hardened. She stared Julian down,her voice cold. "What exactly are you trying to do?"


"I wanted you to have it back. It was meant for you,"Julian answered quietly, his eyes holding hers.

Julian had waited for the right time to return it, and after scrolling through her recent shopping history that evening, he decided now was as good a moment as any.


Yvonne's reaction was swift and sharp. She ripped off the bracelet and hurled it straight at him.


Her breathing came in angry bursts, eyes rimmed with red, humiliation written all over her face.


Through clenched teeth, she spat, "Am I supposed to thank you for tossing me what someone else has already rejected, like I'm some rubbish bin?"


The bracelet bounced harmlessly off Julian's face,leaving him shocked and speechless.
###Chapter 89 Misunderstanding





The weight of the silence pressed heavily across the room. In the corner, Snowy curled inside its small house, watching with glassy eyes as its paws scratched nervously at the bedding.


From where the dog sat, Yvonne looked nothing like the calm and gentle person it knew. Her entire body shook as she glared at Julian with the kind of resentment that came from being hurt too many times.


Julian lowered his eyes before crouching down to pick up the bracelet lying on the floor.


The last time Yvonne hurled it away, several diamonds had fallen out. He had sent Morton to repair it and even asked for a few fresh designs to be added.



His intention had been simple. He wanted Yvonne to notice these details herself and feel touched by the effort.


Yet, instead of gratitude, the moment had turned sour.



Julian looked at her trembling figure and said in a quiet voice, "Everything I've given you has been yours alone. What made you think otherwise?"


Yvonne tilted her head back sharply, stopping her tears before they slipped free. Her voice was sharp and full of mockery. "Oh, please. Isn't this the precious gift you so carefully chose for Rita? You're good at this. Your little romance could almost bring me to tears."



"For Rita?" Julian echoed, his brows furrowing for only a second before the truth behind her fury clicked into place.


A small, weary smile flickered across his lips. He let out a quiet breath, choosing not to defend himself with words right away. Instead, he closed the distance between them.
Yvonne stiffened instantly. "Stay where you are." She shuffled backward in a panic.


By the time she realized she was cornered, Julian was already in front of her. His hand moved deliberately as he caught hers. She twisted against his grip, but his hold remained steady. In the next moment, the bracelet slid back onto her wrist, right where it had been before.



"This was never meant to be anyone else's treasure,"Julian said quietly, his gaze meeting hers at last."Yes, I was reckless with Rita once. I won't deny it.But whatever that was, it's long gone. This bracelet has nothing to do with her. It was always meant for you."


Julian tightened his hold on Yvonne's wrist and pressed the small clasp, revealing a string of engraved letters and numbers hidden inside.


"This was never random," Julian said, his voice low but steady. "Look closer. Those are your initials and your birthday.How could you have missed it all this time?" For a man who guarded his words so carefully, his blunt honesty now felt startling. He wasn't hinting or dodging-he was laying the truth bare.


Yvonne's breath caught as her eyes dropped to the delicate script. There, etched into the metal, was her name and the date she was born.



Something inside her cracked wide open. Pain and resentment surged together, spilling out before she could stop them. "But Rita told me..."


Her own voice faltered. She bit down on her lip,furious at herself. She knew exactly what kind of person Rita was, so why had she let those lies crawl under her skin again?



Her chest rose and fell unevenly before she forced the words out, soft and unsteady. "I was wrong.I shouldn't have doubted you."


Julian's lips curled into a faint scoff. "Of course you shouldn't have. You definitely owe me that apology."



Yvonne stared at him, stunned that Julian would use the moment to his advantage. Her chest tightened with a mix of anger and hurt, and yet she had no way to release it.



Before she could say a word, Julian reached out and brushed his fingers through her hair. "Don't let anyone's gossip shake your faith in me, alright?"


Julian stood a head taller, so she had to tilt her face toward him. As she met his gaze, a thought began to take shape in her mind, one that refused to quiet down.



Maybe she had misunderstood everything between them. Maybe Rita had clouded her judgment,and her own sensitivity had twisted things out of proportion.


For the first time, Yvonne wondered if she could finally be honest with him.


With that hope pushing at her heart, she clutched his arm and whispered, her voice trembling, "Julian,what if we end up having a child..."
###Chapter 90 We Will Never Have Our Own Children
Yvonne hadn't even finished her thought when Julian's face hardened, the fleeting gentleness from earlier vanishing as though it had never existed.


Cutting her off, he stared her down. "We will never have our own children."


The words fell sharp and final, like a judgment carved in stone.


Yvonne's eyes widened in disbelief, her heart aching as though the affection she had just embraced had turned around and struck her.



Color drained from her cheeks as she whispered,"Why?"


Moments ago, he had swallowed his pride to explain what happened with Rita, which made her believe he truly valued her. That was why she thoughtshe could finally share her pregnancy,believing they could welcome a child like any couple in love.


His rejection crushed that fragile hope, leaving her stranded in dismay.


She waited for answers, but Julian kept silent.


Lowering his gaze, Julian said without a flicker of emotion, "It's late. Go to sleep."


Yvonne remained rooted to the spot, silent tears streaming down before she even noticed.


Meanwhile, he had already stretched out on the bed,lying perfectly straight beneath a neatly pulled blanket. His features, handsome yet cold, looked as though they had been carved from ice.
(
Yvonne longed to cut him open, just to know whether a beating heart existed inside or if he was nothing more than a lifeless machine.



Sliding onto her side of the bed, she buried her face in the pillow. Her tears soaked through the fabric,  leaving her hollow and chilled to the bone.


That night, it dawned on her-she must honor the bet and walk away from him. It was the only way to keep herself and her child safe. She could no longer allow herself to be swayed by the fleeting kindness he sometimes showed.



Yvonne shut her eyes, only to feel unexpected warmth curling around her wrist-a hand, gentle and firm.



Her eyes snapped open, anger already rising as she prepared to shove him away. But before she could,Julian's voice broke the silence.


"Sell anything you want, but you must never sell this bracelet."



A shiver ran down her spine, her whole body stiffening at his words. Julian clearly knew what she intended, yet nothing in his tone suggested he meant to stop her.


Yvonne bit down on her lip and shot back with  defiance. "You made me. If word gets out that you only put two hundred grand into the film, everyone will assume the Powell Group is sinking."


A low laugh escaped him, and that was when she noticed how near he was. The sound brushed against her ear, sending an unwanted shiver down her spine.


She forced her eyes shut, trying to shield herself from his nearness, bracing against the pull of his charm.



But he leaned in even closer and murmured, "If I'm not backing your project, aren't you just going to find another investor? With the Powell name tied to the project, do you really think you'd have trouble drawing investors?"


For a split second, her thoughts came to a standstill.The implication landed, and everything snapped into place.



The truth was simple. Nothing in the contract forbade her from securing outside investment.  All the same, she blamed him for starting off with such a miserly budget. His stinginess had stirred her anger so fiercely that she had overlooked the obvious.


He had handed her a way out, but she wasn't about to reward him with gratitude.



Whatever hint of a smile she wore vanished as she rolled away from Julian, turning her back without a word.



Julian's brow drew tight behind her. He let out a quiet breath, leaned toward her side of the bed, and switched off the lamp.


Darkness swallowed the room, and a gentle "Goodnight" drifted through the space between them.(



With silence hanging heavy, neither one found any peace.


The mattress was wide enough for three, leaving a gulf between them that felt colder than ice. Yvonne curled on her side, careful to keep the distance unbroken. She gave no reply, nor did she drift off. With her head propped against her hand,she stared into the empty blackness.


Her palm moved instinctively to her stomach, and as she closed her eyes, a single tear slipped free.
###Chapter 91 Join Her





By the time Yvonne opened her eyes the next morning, Julian was nowhere to be seen.


Her hand drifted across the sheets, the cool emptiness telling her he had been gone for hours.


Back then, his absences had been constant. Even on nights he stayed over, she rarely woke to find him by her side.



She convinced herself his sudden tenderness had been nothing but a performance for Rodger's sake,and after their fight last night, he must have decided the show wasn't worth keeping up.

(

Her gaze dropped to the floor as she pushed away the sting of disappointment and headed to wash up.


Rodger was missing too, no doubt wasting time with a neighbor over another round of chess. Unbothered,Yvonne finished her meal quickly and set off for work.



The words Julian had thrown at her the night before still echoed, sparking a fire inside her and fillingher with determination to build her team.


Arriving at TR Entertainment, she found the elevator lobby packed with silent employees, all waiting in line with unreadable faces.



Her appearance sent a ripple through the crowd,whispers breaking out as she walked past, each conversation buzzing just beneath the surface.


When she swiped her card for the exclusive elevator,the buzzing grew louder-some voices tinged with envy, others with bitterness, and a few dripping with sarcasm. But she just ignored them all.


Reaching the spacious top floor, she slipped into her office,flipped open her laptop, and got straight to work.



She had posted recruitment ads the day before,and resumes were beginning to arrive. Each one she read with meticulous care.



This team would carry her name. Every person had to meet the standards she demanded.



A sudden vibration from her bag caught her attention. Yvonne fished out her phone and glanced at the screen.



Trevor had sent a photo-a beaming selfie of him and his crew, everyone clutching a flight ticket and grinning ear to ear.


A moment later, his voice message followed."Yvonne, we're heading out now! We'll come see you when we get back. Take care!"



Yvonne suddenly had an idea. She had spent enough time with Trevor and his group to know their work far surpassed what most in the industry could offer.


If she was being honest, their fees were modest.With Trevor being both wealthy and easygoing, no other team would give that level of quality for such a price. The flight details showed thei plane would be taking off in half an hour.


Yvonne steadied her breath, pressed down on the voice message button, and spoke quickly,her tone laced with urgency.


"Trevor, you still have a passion for filmmaking, don't you? If I asked you to join my team and shoot movies with me,would you stay?"


Half an hour later, everyone was on the top floor of TR Entertainment, inside the studio.


The photography crew wandered through the space,marveling at the sleek, high-end equipment, their voices breaking out in bursts of admiration.


Meanwhile, in a smaller office tucked to the side,Yvonne and Trevor sat across from each other,coffee cups in hand.


Trevor took a slow sip, his eyes narrowing as he studied the elegant furnishings. A wry chuckle escaped him. "So... he's the one who gave you all this?"



"Yes." Yvonne's reply was blunt, without hesitation."But don't get the wrong idea. For the entire film,he only put in two hundred thousand. Nothing more."


"Well, that's what I'd call petty," Trevor remarked with a teasing smirk.



Yvonne gave a faint smile, though her expression carried a trace of unease. "So,you should know-you won't make much working with me. And it's going to be exhausting..."



She had only meant to test his reaction, unsure if he'd even consider it. Instead, Trevor had shown up with his entire team, ready to dive in.


"I'm not here for the paycheck," Trevor cut in, his shoulders lifting in a casual shrug,lips curved with genuine amusement. "Truth is, I've always wanted the chance to work with you. I once read the script you left notes on. Those ideas convinced me this collaboration would be worth it." On Yvonne's very first day at the company, Brock had arranged for her to review a stack of scripts.She had scribbled her thoughts in the margins, only for the project to later be passed to Rocco. Her annotated copy ended up forgotten in the reading room.



By chance, Trevor had been there that same day to sign a deal with the crew. He spotted the annotated script, assumed it was the director's work, and signed without another word.


Never once did he expect the director would later be replaced.


Hearing him say this now, a weight lifted off Yvonne's chest. She smiled in earnest and reached out her hand. "Then let's make this collaboration count."



Trevor clasped her hand firmly, his grin widening."Absolutely. I'm looking forward to it."
###Chapter 92 Vince Greville





With Trevor's crew secured, the primary obstacle to filming was resolved, rendering the remaining challenges more manageable. The most complex task still lay in selecting the perfect actors.


All that remained was to wait, as Yvonne had already broadcast her call for talent across multiple platforms. She favored thorough preparation over rushing to gather a lackluster people.


Regrettably, most online-sourced companies and performers were obscure and uninspiring, as truly gifted individuals rarely sought roles through such channels.


Yvonne meticulously combed through these options while also proactively contacting prominent agencies and actors she deemed suitable for the parts.


The responses were discouraging, with some even accusing her of being a con director using the Powell Group's reputation for fraudulent schemes.


Hours ticked by with minimal progress, and Yvonne sat anxiously at her desk, staring at her monitor,unaware of Trevor standing behind her.


"This approach won't attract the right talent.People won't believe the Powell Group needs to chase investors-they will assume you're a fraud," Trevor remarked.



Rubbing her forehead, Yvonne gave a faint, bitter smile.



The entertainment world was indeed cutthroat,prioritizing proven success and funding, leaving novices without mentors struggling to break through.


Compounding her challenges, Yvonne had already clashed with some industry figures.


Noticing her exhausted look, Trevor hesitated before offering a reassuring grin. "Don't worry. Every journey starts with hurdles. Someone will see your potential and take a chance, just like I did!" Moved,Yvonne murmured, "Thanks, Trevor..."


She now realized that her earlier optimism, which had believed a strong script would effortlessly draw a stellar team and yield a critically and commercially successful film, had been naive.


Reality revealed that each phase was riddled with practical conflicts of interest.


Yvonne understood Trevor's steadfast support likely stemmed from his loyalty as a friend.


The day's setbacks had dented her confidence,but Trevor, sensing her doubt, gave her shoulder an encouraging pat. "Keep your spirits up! We've got this! I'll tap my network too. Let's do this together!"


Greatly encouraged, Yvonne nodded with determination.



They split their efforts. Yvonne continued reaching out to agencies and actors, while Trevor contacted actors he knew to gauge their interest.


Their persistence began to yield results. Amid the flurry of outreach, a spark of promise emerged.


Vince Greville, a celebrated actor renowned for his captivating performances and charismatic presence,had headlined countless hits and amassed a devoted following.


Yet, he had stepped away from acting years ago,reportedly uninspired by the scripts he encountered.


Vince had once declared he would return for a project that truly excited him, even waiving his fee,regardless of the genre.


To facilitate this, his agent created an account for fans to submit scripts, which Vince supposedly reviewed diligently, replying to those that intrigued him and offering remuneration otherwise.


In three years, however, he had never replied to anyone.


With little to lose, Yvonne sent her carefully revised and annotated script, more as a desperate gesture than with real hope, and promptly forgot about it. It wasn't until late that evening, as she prepared to leave the office, that she spotted a new email in her inbox.



Meanwhile, in a Warren Pictures office, a distinguished and handsome man sat, absorbed in a script on his screen, his face etched with focus and intrigue.
###Chapter 93 No Appointments





Just before shutting down her computer and heading out, Yvonne noticed an email lying quietly in her inbox.



At first, she didn't think it couId be from Vince. She opened it with a casuaI click, but when she saw the sender's name, her eyes widened in shock.


Moments later, brimming with excitement, she dashed to the studio to find Trevor. In her excitement, she grabbed his hand, unaware of the gesture's boldness, and bounced with childlike glee.


"Trevor! Vince Greville, the acclaimed award-winner,responded to me! He said he's very interested in the script and wants to meet to discuss it!" she exclaimed joyfully.


Trevor, caught off guard by her grip, stood rooted,barely processing her words, his eyes locked on their clasped hands. Nearby, the photography crew exchanged amused,knowing looks.


Snapping out of it, Trevor cleared his throat to hide his fluster and flashed a wide grin. "That is incredible! With Vince on board, casting will be a breeze. Actors will flock to work with him, even for less pay!"


A script compelling enough to draw Vince was bound to be extraordinary, and Trevor could already imagine the buzz it would spark online.



"But..." Trevor's face clouded as he recalled some rumors, his tone growing cautious.


"What's wrong?" Yvonne asked, confused.


Seeing her radiant enthusiasm, Trevor shook his head, brushing off his concerns. Those were just unverified gossip, and he didn't want to dim her excitement.



"Nothing, just... I've heard people at Warren Pictures can be pretty arrogant, so stay sharp," he said lightly. Yvonne nodded with a bright smile, unfazed. She was there to collaborate, not pick a fight, so their attitude didn't concern her.


She had braced for a long struggle, and this sudden opportunity was one she wouldn't let slip.


Warren Pictures was a titan in the industry, famed not only for Vince but also for launching numerous iconic stars. Many beloved films, endlessly discussed online, bore their name, making them a gold standard in filmmaking.



Vince had set a 10 a.m. meeting, and Yvonne arrived precisely on time.


Stepping into the Warren Pictures building,she was struck by its splendor.


The decor radiated classic sophistication, with walls lined with posters and signed displays from global celebrities, and even some passersby were recognizable faces.


Before she could fully absorb the scene, a friendly receptionist with a warm smile approached. "Hello,may I help you? Do you have an appointment?"


"Yes, I'm here to meet Mr. Vince Greville. He scheduled a 10 a.m. meeting with me," Yvonne answered.


"One moment, please, while I confirm," the receptionist replied with a nod. Her smile remained courteous as she made a quiet phone call.


After a brief pause, she looked up at Yvonne. "I'm sorry, miss, but Mr. Greville's agent says he has no appointments today."


"That's impossible!" Yvonne said, stunned, fumbling in her bag for her laptop. "I can show you the email he sent..."



"Miss, we only recognize confirmed appointments,so please don't complicate things," the receptionist said firmly.


Yvonne froze, her face etched with disbelief. Vince had clearly arranged the meeting, so how could this Noticing the receptionist's unyielding expression, an idea struck her. She pulled out a film proposal embossed with the Powell Group logo. "I'm here representing the Powell Group to discuss a project with Mr. Greville and invite him to star in my film."


The receptionist's smile wavered, her demeanor turning wary. "Miss, this isn't a place for scams or tricks. Please leave, or I'lI call security."


Yvonne protested, "I'm genuinely here for a collaboration. The CEO of Powell Group is my..."


Before she could finish, the receptionist picked up the phone. again. "Security, there's a stalking fan of Mr. Greville here causing trouble. Please remove her."
###Chapter 94 Not A Good Guy





A group of security guards closed in around Yvonne,beads of sweat forming on her brow as confusion overwhelmed her.



She hadn't foreseen this scenario and was unprepared for how to navigate it.


Suddenly, a relaxed voice called out from behind,"It's a misunderstanding. She's my friend, here to meet me."



The guards halted instantly, and Warren Pictures staff bowed respectfully toward the voice.


"Mr. Pearson," they chorused.


"All right, back to your posts. Everything's fine," the man directed.



"Yes, sir!" The guards surrounding Yvonne promptly dispersed. Turning, Yvonne saw a man sauntering toward her in a flashy floral shirt and sunglasses, his face radiating cocky confidence.


He flashed a smirk and reached to touch her cheek."Yvonne, what brings you here?"


Before his hand made contact, Yvonne swatted it away,eyeing him warily. "Andrew, what are you doing here?"



The man was Andrew, a friend of Julian, infamous in Kumvine as a shameless womanizer. Yvonne had always viewed him with disdain, convinced his bond with Julian stemmed solely from their shared privileged upbringing.



"This is my family's company, so naturally, I'm here,"Andrew replied with a grin.



Unfazed by her rejection, he knew better than to cross her, fearing Julian's wrath.


He had come to Warren Pictures for a shareholders'meeting, reluctantly dragged in by his family, and spotted Yvonne entangled with security.


"If you're not here for me, then what's the deal?"Andrew asked, his tone smug.


Despite his attitude, Yvonne saw an opportunity,knowing Warren Pictures was his family's business."I'm here to mneet Vince. Can you make an introduction?"



She wasn't sure why Vince had set up a meeting only for the receptionist to deny it, but she chalked it up to a possible oversight.


At the mention of Vince, Andrew's expression darkened. "Why are you looking for him? He's not a good guy!"


That Andrew, a notorious playboy, would call the respected actor Vince a bad guy struck Yvonne as petty jealousy. Still needing his help, she chose honesty. "I'm producing a film and want him for the starring role."


Andrew laughed, his tone mocking, "I thought you were sharp. Why this sudden lapse in judgment? Do you even know what Vince is like?"



Frowning, Yvonne bristled. "Of course I do. Vince is a celebrated actor, known for mentoring newcomers and his warm personality."


Done with the exchange, she turned to leave. "Since you won't help, I'll reach out to Vince myself later in another way."


Behind her, Andrew's eyes narrowed, a cunning smile forming as he called, "Hold on."


When she glanced back, he lowered his voice,speaking enticingly, "There is an interesting party tonight. Would you like to come and see for yourself?"


Yvonne spun on her heel and walked off.


Andrew, slightly embarrassed, cleared his throat and hurried after her, flashing a wide smile. "Don't run off! I wasn't done. Vince will be at that party."


Yvonne stopped, turning to eye him skeptically."I don't trust your intentions."


"How could you say that? You're Julian's wife-l would never do you wrong," Andrew said,putting on an innocent face. "Some things are better seen than heard,that's all." 
###Chapter 95 Grand Party





At the entrance to an exclusive Kumvine club,Andrew flashed his VIP card.


The sharply dressed waiter scrutinized it, then offered a courteous smile and a slight bow,ushering them inside. "This way,please."


Yvonne and Andrew entered, her brow furrowing as she took in the opulent surroundings.


The club's decor screamed wealth, and it was evident that only the elite gained entry.


"This is Kumvine's most indulgent spot, Club No. 9,"Andrew said, pausing to glance at Yvonne with a sly grin. "Money alone isn't enough to get you in here-you need influence or fame. Anything service you desire,you can have here."


Yvonne's expression hardened. "What's your game,Andrew?" He didn't respond, striding ahead, leaving her no choice but to trail him.


After navigating a maze of corridors, they reached a lavish private villa.


"Vince is hosting a big party here tonight," Andrew announced.



The party was in full swing-soft music floated through the air, a champagne fountain bubbled, and elegantly dressed guests mingled with polished smiles.



It seemed like a standard high-society affair, not particularly extravagant.



Yvonne grew more baffled by Andrew's intentions.Uninterested in the party's allure, Yvonne brushed off Andrew's presence and retreated to a quiet corner, nursing a drink while her eyes searched the crowd for Vince.



The room was filled with familiar faces-celebrities renowned for their charitable deeds and warmth, much like Vince, mingled with heirs of affluent families, some of whom Yvonne recognized from past events.


Yet, as she had never been introduced as Julian's wife in public, she remained a stranger to them.


As she observed, a vague unease gnawed at her.After a moment's reflection, she pinpointed its source.



The guests' smiles radiated a disturbing excitement,like addicts craving their next hit or predators eyeing vulnerable prey. Their fervor felt darkly unsettling.


Yvonne wondered if Andrew's vague insinuations were clouding her judgment. Then, she realized he had slipped away-he had been beside her moments ago, chatting with someone.



A quick glance around failed to locate him, so she shook it off, choosing not to fixate. Her sole aim tonight was to connect with Vince, and that was enough. Just then, a burst of fervent applause broke her thoughts. Turning toward the sound, she saw a man in a mink coat, cigar clenched in his mouth,being escorted to the villa's center by an adoring entourage.



He looked to be in his late thirties, his mature,striking features at odds with the ostentatious coat.Yet, his eager smile, matching the crowd's, twisted his demeanor from refined to menacingly eerie.



Yvonne stood frozen, stunned. This was nothing like the Vince she recalled from his on-screen persona.What had changed in his years away from the limelight?



Her stare must have been too intense, as Vince's gaze locked onto hers.



As the villa echoed with applause, every eye turned toward Yvonne.



She stepped back, a shiver running through her.


The scene felt ripped from a horror film. Then,Vince approached with a sly grin. "Are you the one Andrew brought along? His latest fling? Quite a catch."



His indifferent tone clashed sharply with the gracious actor Yvonne remembered, once lauded by the press as a paragon of respect toward women.


Swallowing her discomfort, Yvonne steadied herself and said, "Mr. Greville, I'm here to offer you the lead role in my film."
###Chapter 96 Imagination Collapsed





The villa hushed briefly before bursting into mocking laughter.


Vince, chuckling, clamped his cigar between his teeth, took a puff, and muttered through squinted eyes, "And you are? If Andrew had said this, I would have listened. But he just left."



Learning that Andrew had slipped away, Yvonne felt a mix of surprise and frustration, annoyed that Andrew would bring her to this strange place only to abandon her without a word.



But that was irrelevant now. Taking a steadying breath, she kept her cool. "This project is unrelated to Andrew. It is a Powell Group venture."


"Powell Group?" Vince's gaze sharpened briefly,but upon eyeing Yvonne, his expression shifted to scorn."You think I'm an idiot, young lady? The Powell Group sent a young girl like you to negotiate alone? I think you're just tossing their name around to scam your way in!"


"Mr. Greville, I'm telling the truth. You saw my script and said it intrigued you!" Yvonne pressed.


"Oh, that was your script.." Vince murmured, his tone soft.



A spark of hope flared in Yvonne's eyes, only to be snuffed out as he smirked. "I was just messing with you. I never even read your script."


Her optimism crumbled, leaving her stunned. How could this be?



Andrew's cryptic warnings echoed in her mind, and she realized seeing was indeed different from hearing.


The crowd watched her like she was a circus act.Vince exhaled a plume of cigar smoke, sneering,"Even if it's a Powell Group project, it's some tiny,irrelevant thing, right? I'm about to sign for their blockbuster. Why would I pick your little gig?" Yvonne clenched her jaw, her eyes blazing. "You haven't read my script, so you have no right to dismiss it! I believe my script is strong enough to win over anyone who cares about real cinema!"


"Oh, really? Now you've piqued my interest." Vince's eyes glinted with mockery, his lips curling in amusement.


Yvonne's heart lifted for a moment, but his next words cut through. "With such big talk, how much can you.offer me? And what's the budget for this little project of yours?"


The questions struck her where it hurt most, and Yvonne went quiet, words failing her.


The crowd's jeering laughter swelled, their skepticism about her ties to the Powell Group deepening. After all, the powerhouse Powell Group was known for its financial swagger, never hesitating to throw around its wealth.



The evening had been a relentless assault on Yvonne's assumptions, exposing her idealism as painfully naive. Still, she couldn't hold back. "You said you would work for free if the script was good enough...


"What, you think this is some fairy tale?" Vince cut her off, his tone dripping with scorn. "I'm not handing out freebies. You don't know how this business works,do you?"


The laughter around her grew louder, biting. Yvonne stood rooted, chewing her lip, feeling like the butt of a cruel joke.



Vince had closed the distance, now looming in front of her. He took a long pull from his cigar and exhaled a cloud of smoke directly into her face.


Then he said, "Tell you what, spend the night with me, and I'll do your film for nothing."


The foul stench of tobacco choked her, sparking a coughing fit. Rage surged, and she glared at him,her hand flying out to deliver a sharp slap across his face."In your dreams!" Julian always refrained from smoking around her, yet Vince had the audacity to puff smoke directly in her face, an insult she refused to endure.


Her fleeting triumph, however, ignited his fury.


"You've got some guts, hitting me on my own ground!" he snarled.


At his command, the crowd inched closer, their presence suffocating. Yvonne's fists tightened, and she spun toward the exit, adrenaline pumping.


This was an exclusive club, but as long as she left,she believed these high-profile figures wouldn't stoop to violence.


"Stop her!" Vince's voice was ice-cold.


A group of people rushed after her as she bolted for the door. Just as escape seemed within reach, a sickening thud echoed.


A bloodied figure plummeted from the second floor,crashing to the floor right in her path.
###Chapter 97 Lambs





The shocking scene froze Yvonne in place, her ears ringing as if the world had muffled into a distant hum,pierced by raucous cheers.


Slowly, she turned her rigid neck toward the spot where the figure had crashed.


On the villa's second floor, an impeccably dressed crowd gathered, their excitement palpable as someone uncorked a champagne bottle, fueling their wild applause.


Yvonne recoiled in horror, struck by their callousness.



(

How could they revel with such joy when a person seemed to have died before their eyes?


Abruptly, the supposedly lifeless figure sprawled on the ground convulsed in agony, jolting Yvonne with shock, though she quickly discerned the person was
still alive.


He labored to lift himself-it was a teenage boy, with slightly wavy, lengthy hair, potentially striking in appearance, though a gash on his forehead,oozing blood,masked his face.


The crimson stream trailed down his cheeks, staining his worn, threadbare garments, giving the deceptive impression of a ghastly, lethal wound that had tricked Yvonne.



"You..." Yvonne stammered, her throat tight with nerves, poised to ask about his state when raucous cheers exploded from the upper floor.


"Check that out! That bastard is tougher than he looks! He is still alive!"


"Mr. Greville, can the party begin now? Is this woman part of the wager?"


Yvonne's eyes narrowed as she stiffly turned to see Vince and his entourage emerging.


Vince's eyes glinted with a sly grin. "This is Andrew's woman. We owe him some courtesy."


The crowd groaned in disappointment.


"However..." Vince continued, sparking their curiosity with a wicked shrug. "This venue is vast, and I can't monitor every corner. With him absent, a little lapse is only natural, don't you think?"


The group roared in approval, their predatory gazes fixed on Yvonne, as if she were prey ripe for the taking.


A voice boomed from the balcony, "Ladies and gentlemen, let the games begin! The highest bidder can take the two lambs home tonight!"


Chaos erupted, leaving Yvonne disoriented. What bids? What did "take the two lambs home" mean?What sort of event was this?



Just then, she noticed the teenage boy beside her tense at the sight of Vince.


With a sudden burst, he lunged at Vince, growling like a vengeful wolf pup consumed by rage. "You monster! You will pay for my sister's death!"


The teenage boy barely got near before a wall of bodyguards halted him mid-stride.


Vince's mouth twisted into a mocking smile as he scoffed, "Kid, let's set the record straight. Your sister sold herself for money. She willingly became a prostitute. How can you pin that on me?"


The teenage boy's eyes blazed with fury, tears spilling uncontrollably as he wailed in anguish."Why?Why wasn't it enough to kill my sister? Why destroy me too? Don't the poor have a right to exist?"


"You're right, the poor have no place in this world!"The smug response came from the haughty guests surrounding them.


With a flick of Vince's hand, the bodyguards seized the teenage boy, dragging him towards the luxurious champagne waterfall.


In a flash, his head was plunged into the gushing liquid. His eyes bulged in panic as he thrashed violently to break free.


The elite guests watched with glee as his struggles weakened, as if death were imminent.


Yvonne's blood ran cold, memories of her own near-drowning in the swimming pool flooding back.


In that moment, a surge of bravery welled within her,and without a second thought, she charged forward,toppling the champagne structure.


Liquor flooded the ground, and the teenage boy gasped faintly, like a fish teetering on the edge of survival.
###Chapter 98 Threat





The heavy scent of spilled liquor dissipated, leaving a chilling tension in the air.


"Are you alright?" Yvonne inquired, seemingly unaware of the menacing stares fixed on her.Kneeling to assist the young man, her tone brimmed with worry.


The frail, disheveled teen shook his head, gazing up at her with eyes reflecting both bewilderment and dread-bewilderment that anyone would defend him in such a merciless place, and dread because the harsh truth loomed. They were like cornered prey amidst ravenous beasts, just him and her, who seemed ill-equipped for a fight.


To him, escape felt like a distant dream, and her presence only meant another soul doomed to his grim fate.


Barely stepping into adulthood, the teenage boy's courage wavered, tears streaming down his face.


Yvonne, at a loss for how to console him, paused in silence before facing Vince.


"What's the cost to free him?" she demanded.



By now, she knew reasoning with these callous elites was futile; they only valued gain.


At her words, Vince's eyes narrowed, and with a subtle gesture, a bodyguard beside him hesitantly extended a hand.


Vince pressed his lit cigar into the guard's palm,snuffing it out. The guard's face glistened with sweat from the agony, yet he stayed silent.


To these affluent elites, the poor were mere playthings.


Vince's voice was icy. "No amount will free him now.You might even lose yourself here."


With that, a wave of bodyguards advanced.


While Vince might hesitate to defy Andrew alone, this gathering was a sacred tradition among the elite.Since Yvonne, brought by Andrew, had broken their unspoken code, they deemed her accountable.


The trembling teen gripped Yvonne's hand,pleading,"Miss, abandon me and escape. These people are monsters!"



Yvonne gently tousled his hair, then faced the crowd,drawing her phone. Its screen showed a recording in progress.



With unwavering resolve, she declared, "I've captured everything that just happened. None of you wants this online, do you?"


Pandemonium erupted in the space. Most attendees were high-profile figures, celebrities like Vince.


Yvonne locked eyes with one and said, "Robin Hardy,you just signed with a luxury brand, didn't you? A scandal now-imagine the contract penalties ruining your career."


Upstairs, the named celebrity turned pale instantly. She then turned to another. "Adrian Morphew, a world-famous philanthropist, what a shock to find you here..."



A mustached older man looked panicked.



Yvonne steadily named others, each mention stoking their panic.



Smiling calmly, she added, "I assure you, every face in this video is unmistakable, leaving no room for denial."



The crowd's alarm morphed into rage, many directing their fury at Vince.



"Vince, fix this! You hosted this event-if that video leaks, you're finished too!"


Vince's expression darkened as he glared at Yvonne,then flashed his trademark charming grin. "Let's see if you can leave this place."


He raised a hand with a casual wave. "Seize that phone!" A horde of bodyguards surged toward Yvonne and the teen. Grabbing the boy, Yvonne spun to flee but tripped, her ankle twisting as she fell.


The guards surrounded them. Vince approached with a sinister smirk. "You bitch, I'll make you regret this!"His hand rose to strike.



At that instant, a commanding voice boomed. "I dare anyone to lay a finger on her!"


All eyes turned as the villa's main gate burst open,a man striding in, flanked by his own bodyguards.
###Chapter 99 Blacklisted





Julian entered with confidence, clad in a custom-fitted suit that highlighted his imposing, statuesque frame.His gleaming dress shoes clicked purposefully against the floor with each step.


The moment he entered, a hush fell over the sprawling mansion. Not a soul stirred or uttered a word.


All attention locked onto Julian as he moved toward Yvonne, bending slightly to pull her into a warm embrace.



His fingers gently combed through her tangled locks,untidy from her desperate attempt to flee, his face radiating affection.


Beneath his composed demeanor, however, Yvonne detected a chilling fury. This anger wasn't aimed at her but at Andrew, who had just slunk back, his face bruised as though struck, his spirit utterly deflated. "Next time you want to go somewhere, just let me know, and I'll take you. Don't sneak off with someone else, alright?" Julian murmured to Yvonne.


Andrew, realizing his error, stammered an explanation, but Julian's sharp, unyielding stare left him trembling, forcing him to bow his head in defeat.


Throughout the exchange, Julian didn't so much as glance at Vince, who stood before him.


The room was filled with prominent, high-profile figures, yet Julian's presence reduced them to silence, their breaths shallow with fear.


Despite Vince's own prestige and accomplishments,Julian's aura made him feel like an insignificant speck, unnoticed and irrelevant.


Caught between dread and resentment, Vince mustered the courage to speak. "Mr. Powell, l..."


Before he could finish, Julian's cold, commanding gaze silenced him, leaving him frozen, as if the air had been sucked from his lungs. He stood paralyzed, cursing his luck internally.


His thoughts spiraled in disbelief-why was Julian here, at an event he would typically deem beneath him?



A realization hit Vince, and he shot a wary glance at Yvonne, suspecting she hadn't exaggerated her ties to the Powell Group, perhaps even sharing a unique bond with Julian.



As Julian stepped closer, Vince, despite their similar stature, felt diminished, shrinking under his presence.



"Did you plan to hurt my woman?" Julian's tone was glacial.


Vince collapsed to his knees with a heavy thud, tears streaming as he begged, "It was a misunderstanding,Mr. Powell! I had no idea she was yours! I wouId have shown her nothing but respect if I had known!"


Seeing Julian unmoved, Vince scrambled toward Yvonne, pleading desperately, "Please,tell Mr.Powell we're friends, that it was all in jest, alright? You wanted me for your movie, didn't you? I'll do it without a fee!"



Yvonne's view of Vince soured further; his sudden opportunism was repulsive. Recalling the ordeal, a wave of revulsion hit her, and she spat with contempt, "I would never cast someone like you in my film!" Had Julian not arrived when he did, her fate could have been dire.


With an icy glare and no trace of doubt, Yvonne turned to Julian. "I don't know him, and we're definitely not friends. Do what you need to."


Vince's panic surged, his frantic apologies accompanied by tears. "Mr. Powell, please, don't kill me! I know I messed up!"
(

Julian's eyes narrowed, taking in Yvonne's disarrayed hair and tear-streaked face, clear signs of her distress.



His gaze grew frostier as it landed on Vince, his voice cutting like ice. "No need for such drama. We live in a civilized world, so naturally, I won't kill you."


Just as Vince began to exhale, a group of impeccably dressed figures strode through the entrance, exuding wealth and authority.


The mansion fell silent again, the gathered celebrities shrinking back, some lowering their gazes, others trying to blend into the shadowS.



These new arrivals were titans of the entertainment world, second only to Julian. Crossing any of them meant career suicide.



Unfortunately for these celebrities, those new arrivals were Julian's business allies, all eager to curry favour with the Powell Group.


Approaching Julian, they asked with concern,"What's going on, Mr. Powell?"


Julian glanced at Vince, who quivered like a frightened animal, on the verge of collapse, and gave a faint, chilling laugh. "Nothing serious. I've just learned Vince has no interest in the opportunities provided to him. Let's ensure he won't be bothered with such things anymore."


The message was unmistakable-Vince's career was over; he was effectively blacklisted from the entertainment industry.
###Chapter 100 Tenderness





Julian's threat to blacklist Vince from the industry was no mere warning-it was a devastating blow.


Vince knew this meant not only the entertainment world but every other sector would turn its back on him. It was a calculated move to strip him of all prospects, leaving him no place to stay in Kumvine.


Overwhelmed with dread, Vince scrambled toward Julian, his mind racing until he seized on a faint hope."Mr. Powell, I'm tied to Warren Pictures. You and Mr.Pearson are close, aren't you? For his sake, please..."


However, invoking Andrew was a grave mistake.Julian's face darkened instantly, a cold, mocking chuckle escaping his lips.


Andrew, who had been treading carefully, lurched forward, tripping in his haste, and delivered a furious kick to Vince's chest, his voice thick with righteous anger. "Shut up with your lies! Warren Pictures has already terminated your contract!"



The swelling on Andrew's face slurred his words slightly, and Yvonne, who had been frustrated with him, couldn't suppress a flicker of amusement.


Julian was likely the one who had left that mark on Andrew, wasn't he? Only Julian would dare to do such a thing, after all. Yvonne was certain of it.


After berating Vince, Andrew turned to Yvonne with a fawning smile. "Yvonne, do you think this punishment is sufficient?"



Caught off guard, Yvonne nodded absently, at a loss for words. Julian let out a sharp, dismissive huff, took her hand, and led her toward the exit.


At the club's entrance, a sleek luxury car idled.Julian's grip on Yvonne's wrist was firm as they approached, but she wriggled free, murmuring,"You're hurting me."



His jaw tightened, pent-up emotions boiling over as he faced her with a stern look. "Do you have any idea what kind of place this is? How could you come here?"



Yvonne's mind flashed to the chaotic scenes inside the villa-the raucous cheers, the bloodied teenage boy crumpled on the floor. Her face paled, fear creeping in, but she refused to back down in front of Julian,jutting out her chin. "Well, you're here too."


Her defiance caught him off guard, leaving him momentarily speechless. He reached into his pocket,pulling out a pack of cigarettes to steady his nerves.


Before he could light one, Yvonne's sharp voice cut through. "No smoking!"


The sight of cigarettes brought back the memory of Vince exhaling smoke in her face, filling her with revulsion.



Julian, who rarely smoked and never in Yvonne's presence, had only grabbed the pack in his agitation,craving the calm nicotine might offer.


At her command, he slipped it back into his pocket, exhaling heavily as he looked at her. "This club is notorious for its wild, shady dealings. It is backed by powerful people, operates on the edge of the law,and is full of dangerous chaos. You walked into this blind-it's not safe."



Julian couldn't help but feel a wave of relief that he had come here to discuss a project tonight and spotted Andrew at the entrance. That was how he learned Andrew had brought Yvonne here and then abandoned her.


Now, he regretted not landing another punch to even out Andrew's swollen face.



Hearing Julian's gentler tone, Yvonne felt a sudden rush of vulnerability. The fear she had suppressed surfaced, her voice quivering. "I get it now. Vince...he's nothing like his public persona..."



Her words faltered, choked by emotion. Julian drew her into his arms, his hand softly patting her shoulder. Unable to hold back, Yvonne's tears spilled over, her quiet sobs shaking her frame. She had been terrified, her hands trembling as she had brandished that video to fend off her attackers.Without Julian's arrival, she didn't know how she would have survived.


Clinging to him, Yvonne let her tears flow freely.


Beneath the soft night sky, Julian gently smoothed her hair, his gaze brimming with unspoken tenderness.
