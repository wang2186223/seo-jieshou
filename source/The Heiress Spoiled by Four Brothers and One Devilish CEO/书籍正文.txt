###Chapter 1 If There's a Next Life
In a damp, dim jail cell.

A frail woman with tangled hair curled up in a corner,sleeves hanging empty where her arms should be,head buried deep into her knees.

Footsteps approached-light, cheerful, even a little excited.

The cell door creaked open. A woman in a ivory lace dress strolled in, hanging on the arm of a sharp-dressed man holding a rectangular box.

"Sis, don't I look fabulous today?" she twirled in front of the woman on the floor,lifting her hem with pride.Her voice was sweet and light, like bells chiming. "It's your big day today, so I figured something bright and celebratory was in order. This ivory lace...it feels right,doesn't it? Perfect for a wedding! And guess what?Wyatt and I just got our marriage certificate too! Isn't it all just perfect timing?"

Slowly,the woman in the corner looked up. Her face was filthy, crisscrossed with nasty scars that looked like crawling parasites.

Suddenly,she lunged forward, throwing herself at the woman in ivory with every ounce of strength she had. But before she even got close, she was kicked hard.Her body flew like a ragged kite, slamming into the icy stone wall.


Curling up from the pain in her chest, she grimaced as fresh blood seeped from her stitched lips.

Her eyes, bloodshot and full of hate,locked onto the smug pair standing over her.

The man puffed out a breath, brushed off his pants like her presence had contaminated him, then drew the woman in ivory closer and kissed her.

He looked down at the woman on the floor like she was trash. His voice carried nothing but disdain."Megan,still playing tough when you're one step from death? Molly came herself to see you off, and you repay her like this?"

Molly clung to Wyatt's waist, blinking up with teary eyes. "She's always been this way to me, I'mn used to it."

Megan's heart ached. She gave a broken laugh that only tugged at the stitches on her lips, splitting them open again. The agony didn't even scratch the surface of the pain her sister's betrayal carved into her soul.

No-Molly didn't even count as family.

Breaking away, Molly squatted in front of her and whispered with a grin, "Thought you were some badass? So I took your arms. You thought you wvere a beauty? So I wrecked your face. Sharp tongue? I stitched your damn mouth shut. Honestly, it felt great."  She pulled out her phone, flicking through photos."Check out your lovely family's last moments. Now,everything from the Shaw family is mine."

Megan glared at her, eyes burning.

Molly didn't flinch. She leaned in and said just loud enough for Megan to hear, "Even Tristan Reid, the man you didn't even treasure-he'll be mine soon enough. Imagine his face when he finds out you were the one who destroyed him."

She let out a mocking giggle. "Who would've thought you were this genius hacker too? So jealous I could scream."

The moment Tristan Reid's name came up, deep remorse stirred in Megan's chest.

She'd believed every lie Molly spun-believed Tristan was some twisted monster who'd locked her up to torture her, never once stopping to hear him out.Molly had even framed Tristan, making Megan believing he was the one who killed their grandfather.That lie had completely blinded her with hatred.

So,she tore down his company, crushed the century -old legacy of the Reid family.

She dragged him from his pedestal straight to the abyss.

She destroyed him.

Her eyes, dull and lifeless, slowly lost their last trace of light. Suddenly, Molly stumbled to the ground,pretending to be terrified and shaken.

Wyatt Reid immediately knelt to pick her up, pulling her behind him protectively. Then, without warning,he stomped hard on the side of Megan's head, grinding his heel viciously.

He gave a cruel chuckle. "Guess what? All those Reid businesses you took in the end? Yeah,they ended up mine anyway. Tristan has nothing now, zip."

He flipped open a narrow rectangular box and pulled out a military dagger, casually tossing the box aside.

Under the pale moonlight,the blade gleamed coldly.

Then he raised his arm and drove the knife straight into her side.

The sharp chill cut through her like ice. The pain made it hard to breathe.

Megan knew both lungs had been punctured. She didn't have much time left.

Still, not a single tear fell.

She just didn't have functioning tear ducts.

Wyatt yanked the blade out and kept stabbing-again and again. Blood splattered across the drab prison wall like bursts of crimson plum blossoms blooming in winter.


Megan lay there, numb from all the pain.

Her mind started to fade. She vaguely caught the sound of a struggle, then-bang! bang!-two gunshots shattered the silence.

"Megan! Megan!" a voice called out.

Megan felt herself being gathered into a warm embrace.She struggled to lift her heavy eyelids, trying to see who was calling her name.

Just as her vision cleared for a moment, a single tear slid from the corner of her eye.

Tristan was holding her bloodied body close, tears streaming down his face. "Megan, wake up. Look at me.I've avenged you."

With what little strength she had, Megan glanced at the two who had tortured her seconds ago. Now both lay lifeless in pools of blood, bullets to their heads.

Tristan was pressing hard against her wounds, hands trembling as he tried to stop the bleeding-but there were too many.

"Megan. I'm sorry. I got here too late. I'll take you to the hospital right now," he choked out.

But Megan could feel her life slipping away. She shook her head slightly.

She parted her stitched-up, ruined lips, trying to say something.

Tristan instantly understood. He pulled out a knife and gently cut the stitches.

Her voice was raspy and barely audible. "So..rry.Tristan."  He cupped her bruised face like it was the most precious thing in the world, his hot tears falling onto her cheeks. "Don't say that. You don't need to say sorry."

She wished more than anything to wipe away his tears with her hands, touch his handsome face once more.But her arms were gone.

Her sight began to blur again. "I...can't... If there's... a next life, I'll... love you better..."

As the light faded from Megan's eyes, Tristan reached down, picked up the dagger, and without hesitation,thrust it into his own chest.

Megan's lips barely moved, whispering her finaL word,"Don't."

Tristan cradled her still, lifeless body, tears filling his eyes as he collapsed beside her.

With his last ounce of strength, he reached out and gently closed her eyes.

A quiet smile touched his lips. "We couldn't live together. but at least we'll die together.If there's a next life, I'll still love you."
###Chapter 2 Back to the Beginning

"No!"

The woman snapped her eyes open, breath coming in quick gasps as she stared at the pale pink ceiling above her.

Her brows pulled together, and her long curled lashes trembled slightly. She slowly raised her arms-hands cuffed with customized chains that quivered just like her confusion.

"My arms. Molly severed these. Didn't she?" Megan thought, fingers trembling as they brushed unblemished skin. "Smooth lips. intact. Is this.a dream?"

Footsteps approached. She instinctively pushed herself up, though her weak body made her dizzy the second she moved.


Bathed in the soft afternoon sunlight, a tall figure stepped into view, wrapped in a golden glow.

His face was sharp, almost ethereal-thick brows, deep -set eyes, a straight nose, and thin-pressed lips. He looked like he'd walked straight out of a myth-with a sickly pallor that gave him a haunted edge.

"You hate me that much,huh?"

The man stood beside the bed, eyes locked onto hers,  voice low and laced with exhaustion.

Megan's nose stung. She reached out and wrapped her arms around him, pressing her small face against his firm waist.


"Tristan. Tristan."

Tristan's body froze. She'd never said his name like that before, not with that kind of warmth.

She'd always been slick-skilled and full of tricks, trying every possible move to break free.

He even had those cuffs made-ones that only responded to his fingerprint-just to stop her escaping again.

She'd gone on hunger strike because of them.

So what now? Playing a new angle? Soft power?

The damp warmth soaked through his shirt,touching the muscles on his abdomen.

He quickly furrowed his brow, placing his hands on her shoulders to create distance.


"Are. are you crying?"

He'd really pushed this tearless woman to tears?

Anger surged in him. Did she hate him so much she'd rather fall apart?

He was about to tell her-tears or not, she wasn't leaving. He never let go of what was his.

But before he could speak, she hugged him again,tighter this time.  "Tristan, Tristan. is this really you? Am I dreaming?"

Wasn't this the same day from three months ago-when she had stopped eating?

Hadn't she.died?

Her last memory was of him.plunging a blade into her chest.

Could it be. she'd really come back?

Tristan lifted a hand, wanting to gently pat her back.
But at the last second, he pulled it back.

No-he wouldn't give in again.	A

His voice was deep, smooth like a cello, bout cold enough to sting. "Don't kid yourself. You're never getting away from me."

Megan jerked her head up, grabbed her own arm,and bit down hard.


The pain.

So real.

Way too real.

Tristan's face darkened, eyes narrowing. "Are you still trying to hurt yourself?"

She crawled up onto the bed, knelt, then threw her arms around his neck. Her voice softened to almost a whisper, "I'm not. I just had to know if this was real. lf you. are real. I'm done running. Tristan, I missed you-so much. I really did."

Missed him? Wasn't it hate?

Didn't she despise him for locking her up?

This-this was the Megan he'd been waiting for. A version of her he'd never thought he'd actually see.But the sudden happiness felt too unreal. He stood frozen, not knowing how to react.

Megan had cried for a while before loosening her grip around his neck and looking up at him.

Her eyes were puffy and rimmed with red, like two bruised cherries. Seeing that, Tristan felt a stabbing ache in his chest. His Adam's apple bobbed slightly as he raised a hand toward her lips. "If you want to check if this is a dream, don't bite yourself-it'll hurt.Bite me instead."


Megan stared at his clean, slender fingers, then wrapped her hands around his and brought them to her lips.

Just when Tristan thought she was about to chomp down on him, she gently kissed his hand instead.

"What are you doing?" His voice was low. "Trying to win me over with stuff you don't even mean? So I'll let you go?"

She shook her head and pressed his hand to her face,voice stuffy, "Tristan, can we just try to live a normal life together?"

Live a normal life.He'd waited way too long to hear those words. "Do you. mean it?" Tristan asked, still in disbelief.

"Absolutely. I'm done running. We're already engaged I'm your fiancée. I'll stay with you, no matter what."Megan nodded with conviction.

His dark eyes sparkled for a moment, only for doubt to flicker in soon after. "You said that last time too.Didn't stop you from bolting."

Megan knew she'd let him down-again and again.

In her past life, this very day had played out almost identically. She'd done everything she could to gain Tristan's trust.

And it had worked. He'd dropped alI restrictions and stopped trying to confine her.

But she broke her promise, vanished, and hid in a secret underground room Molly had prepared.

Not long after, she heard that Tristan had lost it and ended up killing her grandfather in his rage.

That's when she messaged him privately, declaring war and demanding revenge.

Tristan tried tracing her down, but she was like a ghost, completely off the grid.

She used her tech skills to hack into Reid Corp's internal systems, drain their funds, and leak fake financial reports.

Reid Corp's stock crashed overnight-billions in assets gone.

All strategic partnerships with global companies were pulled. The entire corporation was in chaos.

She seized the opportunity to take it over.

And throughout all this, as CEO, Tristan didn't even try to fight back.

It was like. he let her do it.

It took her just two months to knock Reid Corp off its pedestal.

The flashback zipped through Megan's mind in seconds.



A deep guilt washed over her. She cupped his chiseled face in her hands, looked him in the eye, and said gently, "I know, for you, all this joy feels way too fast -like a blow to your chest. But Tristan, just this once,can you trust me?"
###Chapter 3 His First Kiss
 Tristan's deep gaze locked onto her pale face, a sigh slipping out from his nose. "I'll trust you... just this once."


Megan blinked those innocent eyes at him, gently shaking the cuff still attached to the bedpost.

His sharp brows furrowed, clearly hesitating.

After a beat of silence, he finally made up his mind,pressing both thumbs onto the fingerprint locks of her handcuffs.


A soft "beep" sounded, and the cuffs released with a clack, dropping onto the bed.

Now free, Megan rubbed her reddened wrists and stretched them a bit.


She wondered, "Damn. Not even I could crack these-talk about next level. And last time. I'm the one who tricked him into opening them.....Guess I'll have to ask him again. Ugh.."

Megan suddenly smirked. "Where'd you get these cuffs? I swear, if I find out who made them, I'm gonna make sure they never design anything again."

Tristan cleared his throat lightly. "Some tech guy."

Yup,same answer, same tone. Lazy, as usual.  But whatever. Unlocked is good enough.

Megan leaned in and gave his cool lips a quick peck."Thanks for believing me again."

That kiss sent a shockwave straight through him,blood surging. His Adam's apple bobbed nervously.

His first real kiss.

Assuming that time with the CPR didn't count.

He suddenly looked awkward, ears turning a slight shade of red. "Um...Oh, I'll ask Mrs. Jones to whip you up something. She'll bring it by later. I've got a meeting at the office-I'll head out now."

He turned quickly and made for the door.

When he got to the door, his hand paused on the knob.

He glanced back at her face-the one he loved most-then rushed out as if making a getaway.

Megan's eyes misted up watching him go, his tall frame vanishing from view.

God really gave her a second shot at life.

A second chance to make things right with him.

Her gaze darkened, killing intent brewing.

The debts of her past life-she was going to settle every last one.




A sleek black Maybach sped down the road toward Reid Corp. In the driver's seat, Cameron Brooks adjusted his gold -rimmed glasses and happened to glance at the rearview mirror-only to get hit with a spook.

The usually stone-faced boss was...smiling?

That was rarer than hitting the lottery.

He'd been Tristan's assistant for five whole years and never once seen this man crack a grin.

Was the boss losing it, thanks to that drama queen back at the estate?


"Cameron, focus on driving," came the flat voice from the back. "You're not a reaction meme."

Cameron's lip twitched.Was he being that obvious?

Tristan's little grin stayed plastered on his face all the way to the company entrance.

Once parked, Cameron hopped out and opened the door for him.


The two stepped into the building and headed into the exclusive CEO elevator.


Just before the doors closed, a woman's designer clutch slipped in to block them.

A curvy, seductive beauty stepped forward,her voice like warm honey. "Mr. Reid, wait up."

The air dropped ten degrees instantly. Tristan's smile vanished like smoke, and his eyes shot daggers.

His voice was cold as ice, laced with anger. "Get out."

Clearly lacking the slightest self-preservation, the  woman slid one leg into the elevator.

"Toss her."

"Got it," Cameron responded without missing a beat,now full-on bodyguard mode.

He grabbed her without a hint of mercy and shoved her out the door.

Then he calmly hit the close button.

"Better disinfect the whole elevator."


"On it."

Honestly, this kind of thing happened so often, he'd lost track. Disinfecting the elevator had become part of the daily schedule.

What a mystery that Megan girl was. Wild as she was,she had the boss wrapped around her finger.

And this was the richest man in the empire we were talking about-he could have any woman he wanted.

But nope. He had to fall for someone who didn't even like him back.

While Cameron was still busy trying to figure out that riddle, a cold voice pulled him back.

"The 88th floor. Did you press it?"Cameron cleared his throat awkwardly, hand clenched into a fist. "Uh,sorry, sir. I'll handle it right now."

"If you show up at work with just your head next time,don't bother coming."

"Yes,sir!"  A chill ran down Cameron's spine the moment he heard that. Sweat instantly broke out on his back.

The elevator doors slid open. Tristan Reid, sharply dressed in a tailored suit, strode straight toward the conference room.

At the center of the spacious room sat an oval redwood table, and every seat around it was already filled.


As Tristan entered, everyone quickly stood and greeted,"Good morning,Mr.Reid."

He gave a slight nod as the meeting began.

But honestly, Tristan barely paid attention the whole time. His mind was somewhere else-circling back to Megan's strange behavior earlier.

Was she trying to get him to let his guard down?

Was she planning to run again?

She really would do just about anything to escape.

But no matter where she went, he'd find her.

Even if she ran to the ends of the earth, he'd drag her back himself.

That thought made his dark eyes frost over. His jawline tensed, and both fists clenched on the table.

The room went dead silent. No one dared utter a word,and the one speaking just now froze, lips trembling.

Then suddenly, Tristan stood up and, without a word,walked out of the meeting room with long, purposeful strides.

Cameron scrambled to catch up.




At Dreamscape Manor.

Megan stood in front of the spotless mirror, staring at her own face still dripping from the cold wash.

After days of not eating or drinking, her once-glowing complexion had faded into a sickly pallor. Hair messy,skin dull-she looked like a ghost straight out of a horror flick.


And she had kissed Tristan like this?

She actually chuckled. Would he have nightmares tonight because of it?

She stepped out of the bathroom and leaned against the wall,feeling drained.

Her gaze swept over the bedroom.

Soft pink hues everywhere-her favorite color.

Since Tristan had locked her up here, he had overhauled the entire room. It used to be all black and white, cold and modern-but now? Pink sheets, pink carpet, pink everything.

He'd even filled the place with stuffed toys-all pink too-like he was trying to fill the silence with affection.

Looking at all this, Megan couldn't deny it: Tristan really did spoil her in his own flawed way.

Problem was, the man didn't know how to love.Well then, she'd teach him.

"Knock, knock!"

There was a knock at the door.

"Come in," she said, barely audible.

Mrs. Jones walked in, carrying a tray with croissants and cookies. The moment she saw Megan, her eyes widened in alarm.


Setting the tray on the nightstand,she quickly turned back and helped Megan off the floor.

"Oh, Young Madam, please just make up with the young master. Look at you-you've wasted away these last few days." Mrs. Jones gently helped her to the bed and pulled a thin blanket over her.

Then she handed Megan a cookie. "You don't know this, but the young master stopped eating too. He's been working around the clock and hasn't taken a break. His stomach acted up again."

Megan's brows furrowed.

So that's why he looked so pale lately-he'd been punishing himself with her.

This idiot.

A strange ache settled in her chest, and even the butter cookie tasted a bit bitter.

She let out a breathy sigh. "Mrs. Jones, I'm done fighting with Tristan. I want to start over with him."

Even with Megan's words, Mrs. Jones still looked  uneasy.

After watching her finish the whole croissant, she folded her hands, looking at her with sincere eyes."Miss, please...have some mercy on the young master.He really loves you, though maybe his way of showing it's a bit much."


Megan reached out and held Mrs. Jones' wrinkled,calloused hands, offering a soft smile. "I mean it this time. I want to make things right with Tristan and take care of him too."

Mrs. Jones's eyes turned red, her nose stinging a bit."Good... good. I've watched him grow up. When he was little,he lived with his mom out in the coutryside.Didn't come back to the Reid family until he was eight.Poor child."

Megan had only seen the polished, public side of Tristan. She had no clue about the truth behind his background.

She looked at Mrs. Jones with a hint of confusion in her eyes. "Wait, I'm not following-Mrs. Jones,isn't his mom Mrs. Reid?"


Mrs. Jones shook her head, just about to explain when they both heard a sharp knock at the door.
###Chapter 4 Sister,Stay Jealous
Suddenly,Megan asked, "What time is it now?"

Mrs. Jones checked her watch. "It's 2:20 in the afternoon."

Megan recalled that, in her past life, she had escaped from Dreamscape Manor around 2 o'clock. Right after that, she'd gotten in touch with Molly-who must be the one knocking now.

She turned to Mrs. Jones. "Go answer it. No matter who it is, just say I'm asleep and not taking visitors."

Mrs. Jones looked at the woman who used to want to run away at all costs, now calmly staying put, and felt a deep sense of gratitude.

She nodded and picked up the food tray as she went to the door, blocking the figure who tried to barge in.

"Move. I need to see my sister."

"Sorry,Miss Shaw.Young Madam is resting."

"Young Madam ? Seriously? My sister doesn't care about such titles. What, is she hurt or something and you're all hiding it?"

Young Madam is really just napping, please don't make this difficult for us."

"I don't care! If I don't see her today, I'm not leaving!""Apologies, but you can't come in-"

Smash! A loud crash echoed through the hall as the plate hit the floor and shattered into pieces

The door flung open, and Mrs. Jones was shoved aside,crashing against the wall.

Megan lay in bed, eyes void of warmth, coldly watching the woman walk in with that familiar sultry strut.


Her face betrayed no emotion, but inside, a storm raged.	/

This woman in red-she was the one who'd severed her arms, sewn her lips shut, and wiped out her entire family in her previous life.

There was no way she'd let her go this time.

"Sis," Molly called out, rushing in with an anxious look,pretending to be worried.

She sat on the bed beside her, took her hand with false concern. "You've gotten so thin, what happened to you?"

As if she didn't knowv. It was Molly who'd told her to stop eating the last time she visited, and now she had the audacity to act clueless.

Just how blind had she been in her past life to not see that this snake had no heart?

Megan pulled her hand back and adjusted her covers."Didn't you say I should starve myself?"

Molly's eyes darted toward the door, nervous that someone might've heard.

This wretched woman-how dare she say that out loud?

She lowered her voice. "Sis, I was only trying to help you get away from Tristan faster. I was just doing what you wanted, that's all."

"Sure."

Megan's calm agreement, coupled with her now free hands, made Molly's lips curl up slightly, a gleam of excitement in her eyes.

"Sis,did Tristan finally agree to let you go?"

Megan nearly laughed. "Nope. He's dead set on locking me up here for good."

Molly's face instantly tightened, her brows creasing so hard they looked like they could trap a fly.

She leaned in and muttered, "If he's not backing down,then you've gotta take the dramatic route-slice your wrist."

Megan slowly pushed herself up, leaning back against the headboard.She lowered her gaze, idly fiddling with her nails. "I've kinda changed my mind about leaving...Turns out, Tristan's actually been really sweet to me lately."

Molly shot a glance at the maid standing by the door."Sis, there's no need to pretend now. It's just us. If you're hurting, you can just tell me. No need to say stuff you don't mean."

Megan chuckled, covering her mouth with her hand. "Yeah, I guess it's kinda not true. He did something that I couldn't stand."

"Couldn't stand?"

"I mean, look at me-already this weak, and he still didn't give me a break in bed."

That line hit Molly like a bolt from the blue. Her lashes trembled as she stammered, "You. you two actually did it?"

Megan gave a small nod, voice gentle. "Didn't matter I hadn't eaten for days-he was at me every night. Like he couldn't get enough."

As those words left her lips, Megan tilted an eyebrow,watching Molly's face go through a whole theatrical cycle-from shock to envy, and then seething rage.It was like watching a comedy unfold live.

But then Megan's smirk froze stiff.

Because right then, Tristan stood in the doorway.

Yep.He definitely heard all of that.

"Tristan, what are you doing back so quick? Missed me already?"

Megan tossed the blanket aside and hopped off the bed, running straight for him. Thanks to the croissants and cookies earlier, she had some strength back-especially after seeing him, it was like energy flooded through her veins.

Tristan's face was darker than a thundercloud, clearly not in the best mood. Before she could throw herself at him, he stepped up fast and scooped her into his arms. His tone had a hint of disapproval, "You shouldn't be walking around barefoot like that."

Megan instinctively wrapped her arms around his neck,resting her head on his shoulder as she pouted, "Hey,at least I'm not running out here nude, right?"

That shut Tristan up real quick-his cheeks flushed red in an instant.

Molly stood up now, hands politely clasped in front of her, her voice sickly sweet. "Hi, Tristan."

Tristan straight-up ignored her, not even sparing her a glance.

He gently set Megan back on the bed and said coldly,"From now on, unless I say otherwise, no outsiders are allowed in the Dreamscape Manor."

Megan shot a casual glance at Molly, who was still standing there pretending she didn't get the memo.

She tightened her arms around Tristan's neck. "Baby,I'm so sleepy and drained. Can you stay and nap with me for a bit?"

Tristan kicked off his slippers, lay down beside her,and pulled the blanket over both of them.

Megan snuggled up close, and her hand sneakily popped open two buttons of his dress shirt, slipping inside.

He was that classic case-slim in clothes, built like a  statue underneath.

She didn't even have to look. Just by touching,she could feel the solid definition of his chest and abs.The dude clearly lived a disciplined life.

"Let me count how many abs you've got. Last few times, I passed out before I got the chance to take a good look."

Tristan gritted his teeth, fists clenched tight under the covers.


Did this woman even realize how much she was teasing him?

His eyes darkened as he glared at Molly still lingering at the bedside. His voice was ice-cold. "Get out."

Molly's lips twitched, herhands subtly trembling.

The blood-red nails she took so long perfecting dug deep into her palms, but she didn't seem to feel a thing.

"One. two. three... four..." Megan murmured in a sultry tone,peeking up cheekily as she counted.

That was the final straw.

Molly, her pride shredded and heart fuming, stormed out like a defeated dog.

At the door, Mrs. Jones just smiled knowingly before quietly closing it behind her.
###Chapter 5 Just Stay Tonight
 
Megan took a deep breath-the fresh scent clinging to the man was oddly intoxicating.

She tried to slide her hand out from his shirt, but he held her still.

Tristan turned his head and looked at her. "Didn't finish counting,did you? Keep going."

Megan blinked, her clear eyes flickering."L..1."

Under the blanket, his warm hand gripped her slender wrist and gently guided her downward. His voice was low, deep,magnetic. "Five...six...seven...eight."

"Nine." Megan followed his movement, murmuring softly.

Her eyes flew open in shock. "I'm sorry! I didn't mean to-l swear!"

Even Tristan looked a little stunned for a moment,his Adam's apple sliding up and down. "You didn't mean to?huh?"


Megan jerked her hand back, her face instantly flushing pink.

With one quick move, he pinned her beneath him,eyes flashing with a dangerous glint. "So, you're admitting it now?" She stared straight at his impossibly handsome face,especially those deep, predatory eyes that seemed to suck her right in.

She swallowed nervously. "I-I didn't."

Trying to redirect the conversation, she cleared her throat and muttered, "Didn't you head to the office?Why are you back?"

"Just wanted to check if you'd eaten something.Don't try changing the subject-earlier who was it that said I'm too demanding,huh?"

That teasing lilt at the end of his sentence made her shudder all over.

She coughed lightly. "Well, I knew she had her eyes on you, so... I might've said something to rattle her a bit."


"Hmm? Weren't you the one who trusted her the most?"

Megan looked sly. "After starving for a few days, I think my brain finally rebooted. I can finally tell who's good and who's bad."

Tristan gave her a lazy smile. "So, where do I fall?Good or bad?"

Her dark eyes reflected his sharp features. "You're good. Really good. Especially to me."

"Seriously, who's the genius telling everyone I'm some possessive freak 24/7?"

Megan quickly shook her head. "Shh! No more of that  -you're the best, Tristan."

A faint smirk tugged at his lips. "Words are nice, but actions talk louder."


Then, without warning, he buried his face into her neck,taking in her scent. The unique fragrance of her made his breath quicken despite himself.

All the control he prided himself on? Completely dismantled the moment she came into his life.

And now, holding her in his armns felt surreal.

"You're something else, Megan," he murmured against her skin.

Her small hands pressed against his chest, eyelashes fluttering. "I'mn here."

Tristan slowly lifted his head. "I... want to."

That ragged edge of pleading in his voice hit Megan like a physical blow, a sharp twist beneath her ribs.Her breath hitched. Without thinking, she rose on trembling toes, her palms cradling his jaw. The rough scrape of his stubble against her skin sent sparks up her wrists as she pressed her lips to his-a tentative brush,feather-light.

He went utterly still for a heartbeat. Then, with a low groan that vibrated against her mouth, he took control. No fumbling, no hesitation-just pure,instinctive mastery. His hand slid into her hair, fingers tangling at her nape to angle her head exactly where he wanted it. The kiss deepened slowly, deliberately; his mouth moving over hers with devastating expertise -a languid exploration that tasted of desperation and dark honey.

She melted into him, her fingers slipping into his hair as he refused to relent. His other arm locked around her waist, crushing her against the hard lines of his body. Time blurred. There was only the slick heat of his tongue tracing her lower lip, the possessive pressure of his palm splayed across the small of her back, the dizzying rhythm of give-and-take that left her gasping into his mouth. Every retreat she attempted was met with a firmer pull, a deeper claim -an unspoken demand for surrender written in the scrape of teeth and the addicting pressure of his breath mingling with hers.

When he finally broke for air, his forehead pressed hard against hers, both of them panting. His thumb swept her swollen bottom lip, eyes black with something far beyond satisfaction.

"See?" The word rasped out, raw with triumph. "No escape."

Heat tore through Tristan's veins like liquid wildfire,every nerve ending scorched raw. Where their bodies pressed-hip to thigh, chest to collarbone-a treacherous friction sparked, threatening to ignite the control he clung to. God, she felt too good. Every shift of her hips struck flint against steel inside him.

Yet he forced stillness into his limbs, breath sawing ragged between clenched teeth. To rush this-to let the inferno consume them now-felt like stealing something sacred. Megan deserved reverence, not ravishment. So he gentled his grip, though every instinct screamed to claim, to brand her mouth with his need. Patience, he commanded the beast within.Or you'll lose her forever.

Tristan stopped and touched her forehead and gently tousled her hair. "Be good. Go to sleep. I'll head back to my room."

Megan grinned softly, turned over, and grasped his hand. "Don't go. Just stay with me, okay?"

"Okay."

That "okay" came so fast it was like he was afraid she'd take it back.

Without a second thought, he crawled under the covers and settled in.

Megan peeked up at him, then burrowed into his chest,rubbing against him like a cat.

She hadn't eaten or rested properly these days, so her energy was super low. In no time, she was out cold.

Tristan looked down at the little bundle in his arms, a faint smile playing on his lips.

All his earlier stress from meetings vanished the second he saw her.


Hard to believe that this same girl had been yelling at him in her dreams just last night, and now she was snuggling quietly in his arms He held her tighter, like he was scared she'd disappear if he let go.

Resting his chin gently against her soft hair, his eyes slowly shut.

If this was a dream, he didn't want to wake up.




A red Ferrari sped through the middle of the road.

Behind the wheel, Molly had a pair of oversized sunglasses hiding half her face. Her teeth clenched on her lower lip, clearly fuming.

She slammed the horn a few times, sharp beeps yelling out her frustration.

"Why her? Seriously, why does she get to be engaged to Tristan ? And now she even slept with him?!"

"I've tried every trick in the book to mess them up,how are they still together?! Ughhhh!"

Her voice rose into an angry scream.

Suddenly, she flicked on her right blinker, changed lanes, and pulled up by the curb.

Grabbing her phone, she scrolled to a contact labeled "Wyatt" and hit call.

She glanced at herself in the mirror, flicking her long black hair and raising an eyebrow.

The call connected.

Her voice was sweet as honey, full of flirt."Wyatt,where are you?" "At Enigma Club, babe. Wanna swing by?"

She rolled her eyes and mock-whined, "Tch! Who's the girl this time, huh?"A low chuckle came from the man on the other end. "Tsk tsk, babe, it's always been just you. You're clinging onto me 24/7-how would l even have time to mess around with anyone else?"

Molly scoffed coldly. "You'd better remember that.Which room?"


"Room 888."

She hung up and pulled out a compact mirror and loose powder from her purse, freshening up her makeup. Then she re-applied her lipstick with practiced ease.

"Megan, you bitch! Tristan is mine sooner or later. Just wait and see."

Snapping her purse shut, she started her car and sped off without a second glance.





Dreamscape Manor.

The echoes of two gunshots rang through Megan's dream, followed by the flash of a man plunging a military sword straight into her chest.

"No!"


She snapped awake, gasping, her heart racing like crazy.



Tristan's brows furrowed tightly. So deep down, she was still afraid of him,wasn't she? All those soft looks and gentle words before...were they all an act?

Was she just trying to ease him into letting her go?

That had to be it.

His face darkened just a bit, and he moved to get up.

But before he could, the girl reached out, clutching him tightly. "Don't go. Tristan... please stay. I was so scared."

He raised his hand and gently traced slow, calming circles on her back. "I thought you were afraid of me."

Megan shook her head, eyes earnest. "I'd rather never be apart from you-not even for a second.Why would I be afraid of you?"

That hit him right in the heart. Still, her sudden warmth compared to how she was yesterday-it was too different. It made him uneasy.

He couldn't help thinking all of this was just a sweet trap waiting to snap shut.

Patting her back softly, he stood. "You're drenched in sweat. I'll go run you a bath."

"Mm."


Megan let go of him, her eyes following his steps as he turned away. The corners of her lips curled up slightly.

He hadn't left. That was all she needed right now.

A few minutes later, Tristan returned from the  bathroomn. He came over, leaned down by her side,slid one arm beneath her back and another under her knees, and scooped her up effortlessly.

"I can do it myself," she murmured,startled.

He set her down gently in the bathroom and stepped out,softly shutting the door behind him.

"If you start feeling off at all, just call me,okay?"

"Okay."

Megan slipped out of he nightgown,stepping into the warm bathwater.

Leaning back against the tub, she let her mind wander,piecing together her next move.

In her last life, after escaping Dreamscape Manor today, she'd been caught by Molly and locked away in some hidden basement.

And then next Saturday night-just a week from now-her grandfather had been "murdered by Tristan."

Obviously, the real puppeteers were Wyatt and Molly.

But if she set it up right this time, laid out the trap early, she might stop that murder before it happened -and actually expose the real culprits.

But first, she needed to get out of this place. She couldn't afford to keep living like some pet in a cage.

Rubbing her temple, she sighed lightly. Priority number one: persuade Tristan to let her go.

The warmth of the water surrounded her, relaxing her  tense muscles.She leaned against the back of the tub,eyes narrowing slightly as she mapped out what to say to Tristan.

At some point, without realizing it, her body had started sinking lower along the curved edge of the bathtub.
###Chapter 6 Bathtub,Bubbles,and Us
At the same time, Tristan glanced at his phone-it had been over half an hour since Megan went into the bathroom, and there hadn't been a single sound.

He started pacing, clearly uneasy, then walked to the door to listen closely.

"Megan?"

"Megan?"

Hearing his voice, Megan suddenly snapped her eyes open-only to realize her whole body had already slipped underwater.

She once nearly drowned at a swimming pool when she was eight, saved by someone she's never been able to find since. All she remembers is a hazy image of a teenage boy's face. She's always wanted to find him-not just to say thanks, but to meet the guy who unintentionally stole her firstkiss during CPR.

But too bad all the cameras at the pool were down that day, including the street cams. There was no way to check.

The moment she went under, fear kicked in from deep inside.


She slapped the surface of the water, making splashes loud enough to attract attention.

Tristan rushed in the instant he heard noise. In three quick strides, he reached the round tub-about three meters wide-and pulled her out of the water.

*Cough cough*...

Megan gasped and coughed violently, then drew in huge gulps of air.

"Seriously? Bathtub drowning? Am I gonna have to supervise every single bath from now on?"

His tone was both helpless and exasperated.

"I was just... thinking too hard, okay?" She looked up at him, only to suddenly remember-she was totally naked.

Her cheeks flushed instantly. "Y-you...please get out.I'm not done yet."

Tristan didn't seem in a hurry to let go of her soft,slippery skin, but he finally turned around. "I'll wash your hair."

Cuddled at one end of the tub,Megan quickly replied,"No need, I got it."

"I swear, I won't peek."

And with that, he reached for the flower basket filled with rose petals from the sink and scattered them all into the tub.

Then he poured in a bit of bubble bath liquid, and soon, the tub was filled with thick foamy bubbles.  He sat down on the step. "Just turn around and tilt your head back."

Seeing her body mostly hidden under the foam and petals,Megan obediently followed his instructions.

Tristan squeezed some white truffle shampoo into his palm, worked it into a lather, and gently massaged it into her dark wavy hair.

Then he rinsed her hair thoroughly and wrapped it in a dry towel.

Megan turned, resting her arms on the edge of thetub and letting her small chin lie on them. With those wet,glistening eyes, she gazed up at him.

"Tristan,you're so sweet."

"Wait-are you... up to something?"

Ugh. Was she that obvious?

He was always overthinking and ridiculously sharp.

If she brought up wanting more space now, he'd definitely think she was planning another escape.

She cleared her throat, a little guilty."Of course not.I'm just really touched that you skipped meals with me."

"So? Wanna pay me back?" His face leaned in dangerously close.

They were practically nose to nose, warm breath mingling.

Megan blinked nervously, heart racing like crazy. "I... I figured | could cook something for you."  Tristan straightened up, his lips curling with that mischievous smile. "I thought you were gonna offer something spicier."

She coughed lightly, "Well... let's save that for a better time. I'm not exactly in top form right now."

"Yeah, better time," he repeated, drawing out that last word with a special emphasis.

Her face turned beet red in an instant. "Jeez! You're impossible!"

Tristan laughed out loud, then walked to the towel rack, grabbed a robe, and placed it on the sink. "Hurry up. I'm gettingimpatient."

Watching him walk out, Megan finally snapped back to her senses.

Wait a second... why did that sound so wrong?

When he helped her out of the bathroom, Tristan was already by the vanity, testing the heat from the hair dryer.Seeing who it was, he stepped forward and gently took her hand, leading her to sit down at the vanity.

He tested the temperature of the hairdryer and started to blow-dry her hair.

His long fingers worked through her dark waves,moving like rippling waves on the sea.

In no time, her hair was dry and fluffy.

Tristan pulled her into his arms from the chair."Come on,feed me."  Megan lowered her eyes, lashes slightly trembling. "I feel like I'm not ready yet. though I do want to." But in this life, I want it to happen at just the right moment.

Tristan pinched her chin playfully. "What's on your mind? Weren't you about to cook for me?"

"Ah,haha, yeah," Megan smiled awkwardly, biting her lip.

God,why is my brain full of R-rated content right now?

Pleased with her response, Tristan held her hand and led her out of the room.A

They walked down the zigzag staircase and entered the kitchen.

Mrs. Jones saw them hand in hand and couldn't help but smile."Young master,young madam,you're here.Just say the word and I'll whip something up right away."

Megan smiled warmly. "No need, Mrs. Jones. I'll do the cooking."

Mrs. Jones replied, "Then I'll help you out."

"I want to make lemon herb roasted chicken. Tristan hasn't really had much to eat these past few days,roasted chicken should be perfect."

Mrs. Jones quickly fetched a whole chicken from the fridge, with fresh lemons, rosemary, and thyme already laid out on the counter.

Megan expertly seasoned the bird, rubbing it with herbs and garlic before nestling lemon wedges inside its cavity. She placed it in the preheated oven, where golden skin soon began to crisp.

Standing by the oven, she peered through the glass door, adjusting the temperature to keep it from drying.

Tristan, who had been sitting silently, stood up and wandered over.


Mrs. Jones quietly slipped out of the kitchen, closing the door behind her.

The herb-infused aroma made Megan smile contentedly-then suddenly, two strong hands wrapped around her waist.

Tristan hugged her from behind, resting his chin gently in the crook of her neck.

His warm breath brushed against her skin, turning the swan-like curve of her neck a soft pink.

"Smells amazing."

Megan grinned proudly. "Of course. This is my signature dish."

"I meant you."

His words made her lip curl up unconsciously.

She never expected this man to be so smooth with his sweet talk.


Tristan straightened up and placed his hand over hers,guiding the spoon together.

"My heart, don't ever leave me, okay?"

She tilted her head up to look at the tall man-at 6'3", he made her 5'7" frame look extra petite.

"Tristan, I won't leave you. Not unless you stop wanting me."

He lifted his other hand to gently touch her fair,delicate face and kissed her lightly.

Ding!

"Oven's beeping!"

Megan pulled open the oven door as herb-scented steam billowed out. "Perfect timing-the roasted chicken smells divine."	A

Tristan looked at her with fondness. "When did you learn to cook?"


Her knuckles whitened around the spatula. The question had dragged up memories of damp concrete and Molly's mocking voice echoing in that basement: "Even a stray dog would refuse this slop."Back then, her "meals" were scraps tossed on the floor.


Later, Molly had drugged her water with muscle relaxants and sleeping pills. When she woke up,she was already in the prison cell.

Her limbs were chained, completely immobilized.

She watched Molly chop off her arms with a machete and then strip the flesh with a boning knife.

Her face had been mutilated. Her lips sewn shut. She had endured hell.

Even now, the pain was vivid in her mind and wouldn't  go away.

Megan smiled brightly. "Back in our dorm days, my roommates and I would occasionally throw together meals."


Tristan noticed the look in her eyes earlier and guessed she had remembered something painful.

Gently, he asked, "Megan, do you want to go back to school for a bit?"
###Chapter 7 No Toothpaste,Just You


Hearing that, a flicker of light flashed through Megan's eyes, though in her heart, she figured Tristan was probably/just testing her.

She curved her lips into a smile and nuzzled into his firm,well-defined chest. "You decide, Tristan."

"Alright."

Megan looked up at him in surprise, not expecting him to agree so easily.

Tristan reached out and gently stroked her soft,fragrant hair. "Do you blame me for arranging your leave from school back then?"


In her past life, this man indulged her in everything,even willing to lay down his life for her.

How could she possibly blame him?

If only she hadn't listened to Molly's lies, thinking Tristan was twisted and dangerous, she wouldn't have run away from the wedding, wouldn't have ended up imprisoned.

It was her own fault for trusting the wrong people.

Reborn,she was going to make her enemies pay-but more importantly, she would love this man properly

She gently tapped his straight nose with her pale fingertip. "If I hadn't run away, you wouldn't have needed to do all that. I was too quick to believe lies.That won't happen again. From now on, I'm staying right by your side. I'm not leaving."

Tristan gripped her hand tightly, his voice deadly serious: "Don't ever leave, Megan, if you left me-l'd die without you."

Hearing how intense he sounded, Megan raised her other hand to cover his mouth. "Relax,I won't leave.But let's deal with something more important right now-the Roasted Chicken, or you really will drop dead from hunger."

She gave a sweet smile, then turned to test the chicken's crispness with golden tongs.

Tristan lifted the sizzling roasting pan-Megan steadying it with oven mitts-as they carried the feast to the table.


Megan followed with lemon-wedge garnishes in hand.

She sat down, tossed lemons onto the platter, then pulled his reddened fingertips toward her lips. Cool breath fluttered over his oven-kissed knuckles as she pressed his palmn to her cheek. "There, the heat's banished."


Tristan's chuckle vibrated against her ear. "That bird's teasing us. Time to devour it."

Their knees bumped beneath the table as they sank into plush velvet chairs.  He ripped off a glistening herb-crusted thigh,holding it near her mouth. Juice dripped onto his thumb."Open wide, darling."

She retaliated by plucking a crackling skin shard from the breast, brushing it against his lips. "Payback's delicious."

Fingers slick wvith rosemary oil, they fed each other-tender meat, crispy skin, laughter sticky as honey-until the platter held nothing but bones gleaming under candlelight.

Tristan grabbed a napkin and gently wiped her lips."This was hands-down the best meal I've ever had."

Megan tilted her head, a mischievous smile spreading on her face. "Then I want a reward."

"How about some shopping tomorrow,sound good?"

Even if they weren't completely free yet, it was still a nice start.


Megan gave a soft, cheerful"mm-hmm."

After their meal, Tristan held her hand as they strolled through the estate grounds.

"What's that over there?"

Following her pointing finger, a spark flashed in Tristan's eyes. "That's the surprise I mentioned for you."

"| want to see!"


She eagerly tugged at his hand, pulling him across the lawn toward a construction site in the distance. "Make sure the steps are smooth, and the railing needs to be sanded down properly."

An older man in his sixties was giving orders to the workers.


Hearing footsteps, he turned around-and froze like he'd just been struck by lightning.

Unbelievable. That little troublemaker had actually made up with the young master.

He'd heard about it from Mrs. Jones earlier but hadn't quite bought it until now.So, it was real.

But she couldn't help suspecting-was this just another one of that drama queen's tricks?

Mr.Ford gave a respectful bow. "Young Master, Young Madam."

They weren't even officially married yet,but Tristan had already made it a rule-everyone in the house had to call Megan "Young Madam."

"You may rise,Mr.Ford."

Mr. Ford's mouth twitched. Was this girl even speaking human language?

Megan peeked downward and saw a sunken space carved neatly beneath the lawn.

She held Tristan's hand tightly as they walked down the steps. The construction workers quietly moved aside to make room, lining both sides like an impromptu guard of honor.

The space was empty for now-no clue what it was  supposed to be.

"Seriously? What kind of 'surprise' needs this much work?" she asked.


Tristan looked around with a small smile tugging at his lips. "You'll see soon enough."

He suddenly scooped her into his arms, adjusted her position a bit, and said, "First things first-we've got something more urgent to handle."

Megan flushed instantly, cuddling up against his chest.Was he about to do something... *not safe for work*?Her cheeks lit up with color.

Tristan carried her up the stairs toward the villa,his long legs steady and unhurried.

Watching them disappear,Mr.Ford muttered under his breath, "A leopard can't change its spots-watch, he'll pull some crazy stunt again.."

Warm,dim lighting filled the bedroom.

Tristan walked Megan into the bathroom and carefully set her down.


He picked up her toothbrush, squeezed out some toothpaste, and said with a grin, "Let me see those pearly whites."

Her heart melted a little. Was he really about to brush her teeth?

She bared her teeth and watched as he gently brushed them for her. Her whole soul was screaming *bliss overload*. "Open up. Ahh!"

"Ahh-"


His clean, slender fingers worked the toothbrush with skill, reaching every corner. Then he handed her some rinse water and wiped the foam from her lips.

When she tried to squeeze some toothpaste for him,he stopped her.

"No need for you to lift a finger. I got this," he said.

She snatched the brush right back and squeezed the paste with a dramatic flair. "C'mon, open up. Fair's fair,right?"

Tristan just chuckled and let her do her thing.

Then he heard her say, in a soft mutter, "It's not like you've got horse teeth or something. I'll survive."

Tristan straightened up from his crouch, gargled quickly, then wiped the corners of his mouth with a towel.


"Megan," he said, eyes locked on her lips, "maybe you should stop talking altogether."

Noticing a shift in his tone, Megan gave a nervous little cough. "About all those things | said to you before... I take them all back, okay?"

Tristan narrowed his eyes with a sly glint andstepped in close. She instinctively backed away until her heels hit the wall.

He braced his arms on either side of her head,effectively caging her in. "Not just what you said  before. That horse-mouth comment too."

Her eyes darted. Ah... so he did mind that little metaphor.

She chuckled awkwardly and gave in without a fight "Alright, alright. I was wrong. I'll never joke about your mouth again."

"Too late," he murmured, eyes slipping to her lips again. "That mouth's better used for something else."

"Like what?" she blinked.


"Kissing."	A

Before she could react, his lips were already on hers.

In that moment, Tristan had never felt more content.With her in his arms, he walked them both out of the bathroom toward the bed.

They landed on it together, sinking into its softness like falling into a dream.
###Chapter 8 Full-Service Boyfriend
Megan was kissed dizzy, her head spinning, and before she knew it, her arms were wrapped around his neck like it was the most natural thing in the world.

Suddenly,their lips parted.

Tristan jerked back,taking a deep breath. "You should get some sleep. I'm gonna crash in the room next door."


And just like that, he bolted out like someone lit a fire under him.


Megan sat up, staring at his slightly panicked retreating figure, the corner of her mouth twitching in disbelief.

Seriously? She had finally made up her mind to move things forward, and he ran away?

She rubbed her chin with suspicion. Was something wrong with her charm level?

Glancing down at her figure under the thin nightgown -curves in all the right places, nothing lacking there.

So what gives?

Unless. he's the one with issues?


Meanwhile, the man she suspected of being"not okay"had made it back to his room and headed straight to the shower for some cold water therapy. Tristan tried to cool down the fire churning in his chest. He was seriously scared he might freak her out.

Megan had just agreed to be with him. She was still new to this. He didn't want to mess it up.

Wearing only a bathrobe, he strolled out of the bathroom and sat on the edge of the bed, legs apart and arms restng on his knees, his thoughts full of that sweet little woman.

He chuckled to himself like an idiot.

After a while, he turned his head toward the wall,gently pressing his palm against it.

What was she doing now in the next room?

The urge to sneak a peek tugged at him, but he knew if he went over... there'd be no turning back.

Once he managed to calm himself, he finally lay back in bed.

For the first time ever, the night felt endlessly long.He tossed and turned like a pancake on a griddle.

Then an idea struck him. He got up,walked over to the desk, and pulled out a black phone from the drawer.


He ran his fingers over the screen again and again,then left the room and headed toward the easternmost corner of the floor.


This room looked like all the others, same decor and setup.

He walked to the nightstand and pressed a hidden button behind it. The floor shifted, and a hidden staircase was revealed leading to a secret underground passage.

He descended, the motion sensor lights snapping on one by one. The entry closed behind him.

Not until dawn broke did he finally return to bed.

Even in his dream, he was desperately searching for Megan,but no matter how far he looked, he couldn't find her.

His eyes snapped open. He jumped out of bed barefoot and dashed straight to her room next door.

Taking a deep breath, he turned the handle and stepped inside.

The bed was empty.

His heart clenched in that instant-she really left.

So all that sweetness yesterday had just been an act?

His fists clenched so tight his knuckles turned white,jaw set hard.

He swore, wherever she went, he'd bring her back-and never let her go again.

"Tristan! Tristan!"

Wait...was he hearing things now?

He looked up at the large window. The voice sounded like it was coming from outside.

He rushed over and saw her through the glass, in a sporty outfit, waving up at him while calling out.

Spotting him there, Megan beamed and shouted,"I'm out for a run! Come join me!" The second Tristan saw her, all the anger and tension he'd been holding onto just.vanished.

So, she didn't run away after all.

He slowly raised a hand, the corners of his lips lifting into a subtle smile as he shot her a little "OK" gesture.

Wasting no time, he hustled back to his bedroom,threw on a workout outfit, and darted downstairs to find Megan.
M
Morning sunlight cut through the leftover mist,casting a warm golden glow on everything.

It hit Megan's porcelain skin just right-she looked almost surreal.


When she spotted him striding out of the villa,her face instantly lit up. She bounced over and threw herself into his arms. "Morning!"

Her sudden move made him chuckle. He reached up and gently ruffled her hair. "Morning. Sleep well last night?"

She lifted her eyes, noticing the slight dark circles under his. "Not really. You weren't there with me.How am I supposed to sleep without you? Looks like you didn't sleep great either, huh?"

Tristan cleared his throat and said, "Oh, I stayed up working on the South Eden Resort project in the study Construction's about to start."  Her lips twitched-it was a weak excuse, and she wasn't buying it. Teasingly, she tugged on his arm."Then how about sleeping with me from now on?Sound good? Come on, say yes!"

That soft, whiny tone of hers? Yeah, it totally/melted him.

He laughed lightly and said, "Deal. I'll eat with you,drink with you, and sleep with you."

Megan burst out laughing. "Wow, sounds like the 'full -service' pack<age!"
A
Tristan's grin froze for a second. "Megan, that little mouth of yours is too dangerous sometimes."

He cupped her face, brushing a kiss across her slightly flushed lips.

Her eyes shimmered like water, leaving him wishing he could freeze time right at that moment.

They took off jogging around the man-made lake inside the estate. Two white swans were swimming close, their necks twining playfully.

A light breeze drifted by, sending ripples across the surface of the water.


After their run, they went back to their rooms to shower.


Knock,knock,knock.

When Megan opened the door, Tristan stood there in a sleek slate-grey suit.

He took one look at her in that white lace doll dress-  LX's latest bag swinging from her hand-and was completely floored.

No makeup, but her features were stunning. Long lashes framed her clever fox-like eyes, lips red and teeth white. that smile could ruin a guy.

Honestly, he kinda wanted to lock her up so no one else could so much as glance at her.

"Your phone."

He handed over a black cellphone, and her eyes lit up instantly.	A

It had been taken away ever since he'd locked her up -she hadn't expected to see it again so soon.

Watching the surprise and excitement on her face,guilt pricked him a little.

Still, the next second, he said, "I wiped all the other guys' numbers. Only mine's left."

Megan flung herself into his arms. "That's fine.Whether it's my contacts or my whole life. you're the only one I really need."Tristan felt like his heart had been dipped in honey hearing that. He gave her back a gentle pat. "Come on, let's grab some breakfast."

At the stairs, two rows of maids-all dressed neatly and clearly over fifty-were already lined up.

Mr. Ford bowed slightly. "Good morning, young master. Good morning,young madam."

The rest of the staff immediately followed in chorus,"Good morning,young master. Good morning,young madam."


Standing a step above the others, Tristan turned his head toward Megan's delicate side profile,voice soft and teasing, "Your turn to talk, madam boss."

Megan chuckled, shot him a glance, then turned to face the crowd. "Alright everyone, at ease. Here at Dreamscape Manor, there are thirty million rules you need to follow."

The corners of the maids' mouths twitched wildly.Yep,this drama queen was definitely up to no good. This was pure payback for snubbing her earlier.

Mr. Ford also took a deep breath. Her behavior now confirmed his suspicions from last night. She's changed tactics-not only trying to charm the young master but also aiming to put the staff in their place.

Thirty million rules? That would take a lifetime just to list! And even if she managed it, who on earth could remember them all?

Looking down at the wide-eyed staff, Megan lifted her proud,swan-like neck. "Well? Any objections?"

Mr. Ford gave a slight nod. "Please, Young Madam.We're listening." He'd already pulled out a pen and paper from his trouser pocket, ready to jot down whatever he could.

Standing tall and graceful, Megan surveyed them all like a queen. Her voice was cool and crisp,ringing with authority. "Remember this: Three rules only. Never gossip. Never play dirty tricks. And always obey your  masters. Understood?"

The staff stared in momentary confusion, then chorused in unison: "Understood!"

Tristan casually slung an arm around Megan's waist and led her into the dining room.

With steady fingers, he picked up two slices of bread,layered on the grilled beef,lettuce,tomato slices,and salad dressing, stacking it into a sandwich before handing it over to Megan.

At the same time, Megan passed him a chicken sandwich she'd made for him.

Off to the side, Mrs. Jones, pouring warm milk for them, couldn't help smiling like a proud aunt. Her grin was practically jetting into orbit. Watching the two of them, it was like they were an old married couple.

She had a strong feeling she'd be juggling baby bottles and diapers soon enough.

Afterthey each finished their sandwiches and downed their milk, Tristan noticed a little smudge of milk on the corner of Megan's lips.

With a soft laugh, he leaned in and kissed her, his tongue lightly sweeping across the spot. "Tastes sweet."


Megan covered her mouth, giggling, "You too."

The two of them strolled outside, stopping in front of the garage-a four-story building with fifty luxury cars parked on every level."What kind of ride do you like best? Sedan, sports car,or SUV?"


Megan rubbed her chin, poretending to think hard."Sports car. They run fast."

Tristan's eyes darkened ever so slightly. He pinched her chin gently, dipped low and gave her lower lip a playful bite. "Still thinking about running?"
###Chapter 9 The Fiancée Strikes Back
 Megan blinked her bright, watery eyes. "No way,there's no escaping Tristan."

"Exactly," he replied with a satisfied grin, "Mine-and only mine,got it?"

She never expected Tristan to be so smooth with words. In her past life, he always came off as distant and cold. This time around, though, she just wanted to spend a lifetime hearing these sweet nothings from him.


Tristan pressed the button for the third floor, guiding her out of the elevator.

"Time to pick," he said simply.

Her gaze scanned the floor until it landed on a sleek black Lykan Hypersport worth over three million.

Tristan strolled over to a wall stacked with keys,grabbed the one he needed, and led her to the car.The scissors doors lifted with a slick motion.


The engine purred to life. Tristan kept one hand on the wheel, the other laced tightly with hers, as they cruised out of the garage and away from the estate.

Watching the city lights blurring past, Megan suddenly realized-it had been half a year since she'd stepped  outside Dreamscape Manor.

"Sorry... I've kept you locked in for six months,"his voice was low and remorseful.

She shook her head slightly. "If I hadn't believed all those lies and refused to hear you out, things wouldn't have turned out like this. But hey, at least I've still got a chance to make it right."

Her honesty hit him hard. He didn't know how or why she'd changed so much overnight-but he liked it.Liked that she was opening up to him,letting him love her,spoil her, and finally understand her.

Half an hour later, they pulled up to Cloud Vogue, the biggest luxury mall in Capitol City.

The glossy, jaw-dropping car instantly caught everyone's eye. People on the street paused to try and get a glimpse of who was inside.

Tristan's eyes turned sharp with discomfort.

Megan noticed and quickly leaned over to kiss his chiseled cheek. "ChilL. They're not checking me out-Well,they are dying to know who this rich and..showy person is."

He raised a brow, ignoring the first part. "Did you just call me...showy?"

Tristan chuckled, loosening his tie, clearly in a great mood now.


Seeing that smug look on his face reminded Megan of how flustered he'd been the night before. She decided to tease him a bit.

She casually slid her soft hand onto his thigh and slowly moved it upward. "Then why not turn up the heat? Let's give them another showstopper like last night's make-out session?"

His body tensed in an instant, breath hitching.His voice turned low and rough. "Knock it off."

Grabbing her mischievous hand, he growled,"Play with fire again and you're not getting out of this car."Megan blinked her clear eyes, playing innocent."Really? Who was the one who ran off halfway last night?"

"I was scared. scared I'd hurt you."

At that, Megan froze. So that's what he was worried about?

"Tristan, I'm okay. I'm not a kid anymore. I'm almost twenty, and I'm your fiancée. What are you still worried about?"


Tristan pulled her against his chest, breath catching."I want you mine. Forever, with papers and rings to prove it."

Megan's eyes lit up, thumb brushing his jaw. "So... a quick stop at City Hall and I get to call you husband?"

He looked down at her delicate face, a smile tugging at his lips. "Then let's go tomorrow."

Megan gave a little nod and buried her face in his chest.  Though... something felt off.

Why did it feel like she'd just walked into a trap?

Ten minutes later, the scissor doors of the car lifted.

Tristan got out first, walked around to the passenger side, and opened the door like a gentleman.

He held out his hand in invitation.

When her soft hand landed in his palm,he gently helped her out of the car.

His fingertips brushed against her slightly swollen lips.He hadn't meant for that to happen-but he'd clearly overdone it.

Ignoring the stares thrown their way, Tristan wrapped an arm around Megan's slim waist and led her into the mall.

Inside a luxury boutique, they'd barely entered before Tristan emerged again with two shopping bags.

Then it was six.

"LX's clothes and bags suit you. Let's check them out."

As they stepped into LX's women's section,four sales associates came over.


All four pairs of eyes instantly locked onto Tristan,practically glued there.

This man-who didn't know him? He was the dream guy for teenage girls and bored housewives alike.

But the moment they saw that impossibly good-looking man holding a Barbie-doll-beautiful girl,their  smiles froze.


They exchanged glances

Wait, could this be the infamous fiancée of Mr. Reid?

Wasn't it rumored they weren't on good terms?

Didn't she ditch the engagement party?

So what did she do-seduce him back into bed?


Megan lifted her brow slightly and looked them over."Like what you see?"

Caught red-handed, the salesgirls quickly averted their eyes, faces flushing with embarrassment.

Megan slid her arms around Tristan's neck,rose onto tiptoe, and gave his lips a quick peck. "Eyes off. He's mine."


Tristan's lips curled into a small smile. Well, look at that-his girl had a possessive streak. He liked it.

He turned to the sales staff, expression cooling,tone low."Show me your latest collections-limited editions,runway pieces.Size 100-60-90."

As soon as he finished speaking, the four salesgirls nodded and hurried off to get the clothes.

Hearing him rattle off her exact measurements,Megan's face flushed a deeper red.How could this guy know her so well?


Her gaze slipped to the side, and suddenly she spotted a little girl, around five or six, walking past the store with an ice cream in her hand. She subconsciously bit her lip.

If you don't count her past life,it had still been half a year since she last had any.

Tristan caught the look in her eyes."Want one? I'll get it for you."

Megan nodded like a pecking chicken. "Yeah,chocolate flavor."


"Got it."


Tristan set the shopping bags down on the sofa and stepped out.

As his tall figure disappeared from view, Megan turned back and started flipping through the dresses one by one.

She puffed out her cheeks. The past six months, LX's designs had been kind of off.

She lifted up a sleeveless deep V evening gown in champagne with tiny crystals-a rare one that actually looked decent.

Suddenly, a pale slender hand reached out,yanking the hanger toward itself.

Megan glanced sideways at the girl trying to snatch it and didn't let go.

"I saw it fist," she said coolly.

"Well, well!" The girl with shoulder-length purple hair gave a mocking chuckle. "Look who it is. Isn't that Megan, the one Tristan dumped?"  "Hah," Megan let out a low laugh."You brain-dead or something? When did he ever dump me?"

The girl yanked the hanger harder. "So what,are you saying you dumped him? Please. Your reputation's already trash at our university. You've been on a break from school for half a year. What, got yourself a benefactor or something? Hahaha."

"Sure, I've got one," Megan casually flipped her dark curls, lips curving in a sarcastic smile. "But he's the kind of man you'll never get close to in your lifetime."

"Hey! Amelia, you gotta see this!" the purple-haired girl turned her head and shouted toward a sweet-faced girl nearby.

Amelia walked over and stood behind them. "Natalie,Megan saw that dress first. Don't snatch it."

Megan gave Amelia a quick glance-she was the heiress of the Lewis family in Lindon City.

Natalie Banks scoffed at her. "Well, I'm taking it today.It's a limited edition. I've been waiting forever for this to come in."


Amelia called over the sales assistant. "Excuse me, is there another one of this dress?"


The assistant apologized, "I'm sorry, there's only one in the whole country and it's here in Capitol City."

Natalie sneered. "That gown costs fifty thousand dollars, Megan. Planning to beg your benefactor for another handout?" Megan's laugh tinkled like champagne flutes. "Darling,when my silver fox arrives..." She leaned in, voice dropping to a velvet whisper. "...you won't even qualify to call him sir."

"You-!"

Natalie suddenly raised her hand and aimed a slap at Megan's pale face.
###Chapter 10 Mrs.Reid, Not Miss Shaw

Just as things were about to spiral out of control,Amelia covered her mouth in shock.


"Crack!"


The sharp snap of a dislocated joint sliced through the store's silence.A
Natalie's wrist hung at a weird angle midair. Her other hand let go of the hanger and clutched her injured wrist, tears streamng down her face. "You vicious b*tch! First you snatched my dress, and now you went and hurt me! If you don't get on your knees, take me to the hospital, and pay for everything-including my 'emotional trauma'-this isn't over!"

Megan gave that evening gown a quick glance, then grabbed the deep-V neckline and tore it apart with a loud rip.

"Rippp!"

Everyone in the boutique was stunned.

Megan tossed the shredded dress right onto Natalie's face. "If you like it so much, just take it."

Then she pulled a wet wipe from her purse, calmly cleaning her hands. Afterward, she neatly stuffed the used wipe into the front of Natalie's shirt.Natalie's face turned bright red from rage and humiliation. She threw both the dress and wipe to the floor and shouted at the shop assistant,"You all saw that, right? She ripped it! Cal the cops on her! She obviously can't afford it!"

The sales assistant looked at Natalie like she'd lost her mind. I mean, come on-her man is Mr. Reid, the richest man in the country and probably soon to top the world list.


Without a word, Megan fished out a 3VIP card from her LX purse and handed it over. "Charge it to this3V card."


The sales assistant's eyes sparkled-it was the only 3V card in the world. Owning it meant everything was free-new releases, limited editions, exclusive collections-all with priority/access.

Receiving it with both hands, she said politely, "Miss Shaw,please give us a moment while we confirm with the manager."

Even with her face streaked in tears, Natalie couldn't stop mocking. "Oh please, quit pretending. Let's see how awkward you look when they find out it's fake!"

Less than a minute later, a woman with a heavy coat of makeup and killer curves marched over with the assistant trailing behind. She stopped in front of Megan,bowed respectfully, and held out the card."Miss Shaw, welcome. I'm the manager of LX's Capitol City branch. Here is your card. You may select and take any item you like from the store, no charge,plus you get early access to future collections."

Megan nodded slightly and placed the card back in her purse.

Natalie froze, mid-sniffle, completely forgetting to cry. She blinked at the manager. "Wait. Are you sure that card's not fake?"

The manager smiled politely. "Sorry,miss. Miss Shaw is indeed the rightful owner of our 3V card. We kindly ask that you wait outside so Miss Shaw can enjoy our exclusive store-clearing service without disturbances."

Natalie, still holding her dislocated wrist, scoffed coldly, "Oh please, just some slut who slept her way up-"

"Who the hell are you talking about?"

A sharp male voice cut through the noise like ice.

Everyone turned toward the entrance.

Tristan walked in holding a chocolate ice cream cone.

Natalie instantly switched to her pitiful mnode,her tone syrupy sweet, "Tristan, look! That's the same Megan who bailed on your engagement!"

Tristan barely glanced her way, his brows furrowing like he'd just seen something repulsive. He stepped aside without hesitation and walked straight to Megan.

He offered the ice cream to her lips, softening his expression, "See if you like it. Got it from Godiva."

Megan took a small bite, her smile warm and sweet. Mm, delicious. Thanks, hubby."

The "hubby" nearly made his heart skip a beat.

Everyone else was just as shocked.

Tristan then turned to glare at Natalie, cold as frost."Apologize."

Natalie's eyes teared up again as she tried her best to look pitiful. "Tristan, l-it wasn't me! She took my dress and then attacked me!"Tristan narrowed his sharp eyes slightly, scanning the scene. Yeah, his girl hadn't lost out at all.
A
Then suddenly, he felt a tug on his arm. Turning his head, he found her clinging to him, holding an ice cream in one hand, moping adorably.

"Honey, I'm scared," Megan pouted. "I saw that dress first, but that green-haired one insisted she spotted it before me, even tried to hit me. I just raised my hand,and whoosh-her wrist's like that now. And she even called you my benefactor."

Scared? And green hair?

What,was she colorblind?

Natalie: "......"


Amelia:"......"


Everyone else: "......"

Tristan's gaze grew darker. "Green hair? Seriously?Your wrist popped just from that? How much force did you use trying to hit my girl?"  His voice turned icy, "Say sorry, or your entire Banks family can pack up and leave Capitol City."

He'd seen Natalie before-second daughter of the Banks family, pampered and bratty all her life.

Natalie bit down on her lip, holding back tears, putting on the biggest victim act she could manage. "I'm sorry,Miss Shaw."

Tristan corrected her coolly, "Say Mrs. Reid."

Swallowing her pride, Natalie forced it out, "I'm sorry,Mrs. Reid."


"Happy now?" he asked gently.

Megan licked her ice cream contentedly and smiled,"Yep. Who knew some trash bins could smell so...fragrant."

She turned to the store manager, "Pack up everything I picked, thanks."

Just then, Tristan pulled out his wallet, ready to flash his black card.

Megan stopped him with a laugh, "Babe, I'm an LX 3V premium member. Everything's on the house."

Tristan blinked. Then, with a thoughtful look, slid the card back. His smile was faint, but his eyes lingered on her.


He picked up the ten shopping bags and added the ones from the couch, then slung an arm around her waist as they walked out together.

Natalie stomped her foot in frustration. "Amelia! Look  at my wrist, I swear it's broken! That Megan witch totally humiliated me!"

She huffed, "I've always thought you and Tristan would be perfect together. Why did the Shaw family beat us to it? I mean, your Lewis family is way more powerful than theirs!"

Amelia looked at the couple's retreating backs, then turned to Natalie, "You should take this as a lesson.Loose lips sink ships. Let's go, I'll take you to a doctor."

Once the store cleared out, four salesgirls huddled around the manager.

"Manager,who is that girl from the Shaw family?"

"How does she have the only 3V card in the world?"

"And she even called Mr. Reid her husband! Didn't she bail on her engagement party before?"

"Seriously, the girl shops here for free.How's that fair?"

The manager threw them a cold glance, lip curling with a touch of sarcasm, "Even if the Shaw family isn't quite at the Reid family's level, they're still a big deal in Capitol City. That card? It's said to be personally made by Lila Moore herself, the designer and founder of LX. Gifted only because she's close friends with Mrs.Reid. You attract what you are. So instead of being jealous, maybe work on yourselves. There's a reason Mrs. Reid can keep someone like Mr. Reid loyal."

With that,she left.

In the car.  Tristan glanced at the girl still nibbling on chocolate ice cream. "Say 'honey' again. I wanna hear it."

Megan pouted slightly, "Nope. I'll say it tomorrow after we get our certificate."

"I really wanna hear it. Sayit, and I'll literally give you my life."

His eyes were full of longing, and Megan melted.

"Honey," she whispered.

His eyes lit up like stars. With a chuckle, he asked,"Babe,is the ice cream good?" A

"Sweet," she giggled, handing it to him.

"I don't buy it." Tristan's lips curved into a smirk.

Next second, he gently cradled the back of her head.

Then,his lips found hers.
###Chapter 11 The Snake in Red
The sweet scent of chocolate filled the car.

Megan opened her eyes with a smile tugging at her lips. "Now do you finally believe it's sweet?"

Tristan licked his lips, eyes full of contentment. "Not as sweet as you. You're easily the sweetest thing in this world."

Megan raised a brow slightly, amused. "Wow, I didn't know you were such a smooth talker. Have you used that line on someone else before?"

"Only on you," Tristan said seriously. "This life, next life,every life-only you."

Her heart gave a little ache at those words.

This life, she swore she'd treasure it.

And this man-she'd love him with all she had.

Seeing her eyes turning misty, Tristan shifted a little,unsure. "What's wrong, babe? Did I overdo it?"

Megan shook her head quickly and took a small spoonful of her ice cream to hide her emotions.

But the chill hit her throat instantly, making her cough a couple of times. "No, I'm fine. It's just... talking about this life made me think of my grandpa. Molly came by a week ago and said he's in the hospital. I'm  not even sure how he's doing now.

He already had Alzheimer's, and now he's got a brain tumor.It really doesn't sound good."

Tristan reached over to gently ruffle her hair. "Then let's go see him now. After we get our marriage certificate tomorrow, we'll swing by your old place too.""Okay."

The car pulled out and headed toward the Capital Hospital.

On the way, Megan glanced over and asked carefully,"Aren't you curious about that 3V VIP card ?"

Tristan spared her a quick glance. "You studied design.You even spent half a semester in France, right?Knowing some top designers isn't exactly out of left field.

Lila Moore might keep a low profile, but that doesn't mean she doesn't have friends. Honestly, the real surprise is that she has taste good enough to make friends with you."

Megan looked out the window, murmuring,"Yeah. Lila really does have good taste."

They arrived at the hospital just before noon.

Before heading up, the two picked up a couple of magazines and a comfort care set from a nearby shop.

They made their way to Room 1123 in neurosurgery.

Pushing open the door, they saw an elderly man with white hair and reading glasses, reclining in bed with a  book. A male nurse was peeling an apple beside him.

Hearing footsteps, the old man looked up and peered at the door. "Who are you here for?"

Megan quickly/stepped closer and gently held his arm."Grandpa, it's me, Megan. I came to see you."

"Megan. Megan." Bernard Shaw looked blank. "I don't remember you."

Megan had expected this. His condition had clearly gotten worse.

The caregiver stood up and gave her a polite nod."Hello, Miss. I'm Mr. Shawv's nurse. And you are?"

"I'm his granddaughter, Megan," she replied.

Bernard stared at her for a beat, then muttered to himself,"Megan? Megan."

Suddenly,he clutched his head with both hands."My head.it hurts. it hurts so bad."

His eyes rolled back, foam gathered at his mouth-he was having a seizure.

The nurse rushed to press the emergency call button while explaining, "Lately, this happens a lot. When he sees a face that sparks a memory, he tries to remember, and it triggers these headaches."

Just then, a doctor and two nurses came rushing in

Tristan set down the bouquet and fruit basket on the nearby table, then gently pulled Megan aside.

Following the doctor's orders, one nurse gave Bernard a sedative, another a painkiller injection.

Soon,he quieted down and drifted off to sleep.

They all stepped outside the ward.Tristan looked straight at the doctor and asked, "Hi, Doctor. Can you tell me how likely Mr. Shaw's surgery is to succeed?"

The doctor's eyes lit up the moment he recognized him, his tone turning extra polite. "Oh, so it's Mr. Reid -what a pleasure! Mr. Shaw's brain tumor is malignant.Honestly, the odds of a successful surgery are only around twenty percent. Afterward, he'll still need chemotherapy,radiation, and targeted treatments to tackle the remaining cancer cells. Given his current health, things don't look very optimistic."

Megan frowned. "Isn't there a better option?"

The doctor shook his head. "Post-surgery treatment is one thing, but the key is the operation itself. If you can get Professor Brandon Lewis-he's an international neurosurgery expert-the chances could jump to at least sixty percent."

Tristan and Megan spoke at the same time, "The Lewis family?"

The doctor nodded. "Word is, Professor Lewis should be back from the States by mid-September. If you can get him to take the case, your odds are a lot better."


Once the doctor left, Megan looked at Tristan. "I heard Brandon Lewis is kind of cold. He doesn't accept just any case." Tristan reached out, lightly ruffling her hair."Don't worry, I've got this. I know him personally."

Megan's eyes lit up. "That's a relief. Thank you, Tristan.""Uh-uh. Say 'honey.'"

She smiled,eyes full of gratitude. "Thanks, honey."

After spending some more time in the hospital with Bernard, the two finally headed out.

Not long after they drove off, a flashy red Ferrari pulled up at the hospital entrance.

Molly stepped out,swinging her branded LX handbag,and walked in.

Once inside the room, she pulled off her sunglasses and glanced at the man in the hospital bed. Her tone was dripping with arrogance. "Anyone been here today?"

The caretaker nodded. "Yes, the richest man of the ountry, Mr. Reid, came by. And a pretty young lady named Megan."

Molly's fingers clenched around her sunglasses until-crack-the frame snapped.

"Damn it," she muttered.

Chin tilted high, she snapped, "Go bring me some hot water."

The caretaker scratched his head. "Actually, the thermos already has freshly boiled water."

Molly inhaled deeply, smiled sarcastically, and said,"I  told you to go. Problem?"

With no choice, the flustered caretaker lifted the full thermos and stepped out.

Molly waited until the coast was clear before stepping to the bedside, smnacking Bernard's face and giving his arm a vicious twist.


Her eyes turned cruel like a snake's, voice low and venomous. "You old bastard. You've always favored that little b*tch. Now look at you-totally useless. Just wait. I won't let any of you live in peace. Not a single one of you."

She let out a cold snort and walked out.

When the caretaker returned,he noticed Bernard's red cheek. Scratching his head, he murmured,"Weird.Did he scratch himself?"

Out in the car, Molly was fuming as she slammed the door behind her.


Her phone buzzed.


"Dad?"


She picked up with a sweet voice. "Hey, Dad."

"Where are you?"

"I came to the hospital to see Grandpa."

"Good kid. Always so thoughtful."

"Molly, we're all going to Mr. Reid's birthday banquet this Saturday. Pickout a good gift. It's a big deal.You'll get to meet some important people."  "Got it,Dad."

Once the call ended, a strange little smile curled at Molly's lips as her eyes narrowed.
###Chapter 12 Spy Codes & Sweet Bots
Back at the Dreamscape Manor, Cameron was already waiting at the villa entrance.

When he saw Tristan and Megan walking hand in hand,he gave a respectful bow and handed over a sleek black laptop bag.
A
Tristan took it and led Megan into the house.

Inside the room, Tristan placed the laptop bag on the desk, gently held Megan's shoulders and guided her into the leather chair.


He unzipped the bag and pulled out a brand-new Luvaglio laptop.

This one was a real luxury-at least a million-dollar price tag, and the lid had a sparkly pink heart design made out of tiny diamonds.

"Like it?"


Megan softly ran her fingers over the heart, then opened the laptop. Programs like CorelDraw were already installed-perfect for her fashion design work.

"Thank you,honey."

Tristan leaned down and kissed her smooth forehead."Your smile's my receipt, sweetie. I'm heading out for a bit; eat something if dinner's ready. I'll have  someone stay with you, okay?"

With that, he turned and headed toward the door.

"I'lI wait for you," Megan called out, eyes glued to his tall figure.

He smiled faintly,his deep voice low and warm, "Okay."

Megan stood by the tall, clean window, watching the black Maybach disappear down the driveway.She sighed,feeling a little hollow.

Turning back, she nearly jumped out of her skin.

A white robot about 1.8 meters tall was suddenly standing right in front of her.

It let out a creepy "Ke-ke-ke" laugh. "Dearest,most admirable, stunning lady boss, I'm Zeta Prime. So thrilled to be at your service."

Megan twitched her lips. "So, you're the 'person'Tristan said would keep me company?"

Zeta's optical sensor bloomed a holographic heart."Call me the galaxy's favorite bot! No blood? My hydraulic fluid pumps hotter. No muscles? Titanium limbs snap asteroids. No brain? This quantum core outthinks supernovas. Zeta Prime: unbeatable.Undefeated.Un-skip-able!"

Megan walked a couple of circles around it.Something like this-with genuine self-awareness-wasn't even on the market yet.

She tilted her head, thoughtfully rubbing her chin."So,which genius cooked you up?" Again came that "ke-ke-ke" laugh. "Made by Professor XAL, dear and dazzling lady boss."

Professor XAL?

Even though no one had ever seen the man, his name was a legend in the scientific community-basically a myth.

"Is XAL a he? A she? Cute or creepy? How come I've never heard of someone inventing you?"

Zeta shook its head dramatically. "I've been alive for one hundred days now, living in the room on the far east side of the first floor. Mymaster said, whatever the beloved Megan wants-just tell me."

Megan had a strong suspicion the robot had a serious chatterbox circuit. She cleared her throat. "From now on,just call me Goddess."

"As you wish,Goddess."

Megan sat back in the leather chair and opened her laptop.Her fingers hovered above the keyboard-then she suddenly paused.

Zeta was still standing behind her.

She glanced back. "Zeta, go to the kitchen and help Mrs. Jones with dinner."


Zeta's eyes spun. "On it!"

It zoomed off with a click of its wheeled feet and gently closed the door behind it.Megan turned her head and her fingers started flying across the keyboard. White lines of code scrolled down the black screen. She had hacked into the national communication satellite system, trying to intercept Molly 's phone calls.

She flipped open her phone and checked the internal chip,scanning through the data.

Nothing unusual popped up.

Megan locked the screen, stood up, and headed to the kitchen.

Inside the kitchen, Zeta was hovering by Mrs. Jones,blurting out nonsense like, "You got this, Mrs. Jones!You rock! You're unbeatable! Muah muah~"


Megan rubbed her forehead. She knew this droid wasn't just here to "keep her company." Tristan had clearly stationed it here to keep tabs on her.

Honestly though, couldn't he have picked a quieter model? This one never shut up.

As soon as Zeta detected footsteps, its body stayed still but its head spun around like an owl, eyes lighting up with red hearts. "Here comes our goddess! So fierce,so fabulous!"

Megan lightly patted its metal arm. "You see that bowl of potatoes? Take it over to the trash can and start peeling."

"Got it!"


Zeta obediently carried the bowl over, squatted beside the trash can, and started peeling while babbling nonsense, "Zeta is smart, Zeta is cool, Zeta is goddess's fave lil bot..."

Megan couldn't help but laugh in frustration. What kind of weirdo robot did this XAL professor create?

She sighed deeply. "Starting right now, zip it. Selective hearing mode,okay?"

"You got it, Goddess!"

Megan turned to Mrs. Jones. "Mrs. Jones, remember you once mentioned Tristan's past? Can you tell me the full story?"

Setting down the knife, Mrs. Jones's expression turned wistful as old memories crept back.

Turns out, Tristan's mother wasn't Mrs. Reid-but Nathan Reid's first love, Henrietta.

Back then, Nathan and Henrietta had secretly registered their marriage. But because Henrietta came from a poor background, the Reid family refused to accept her. They arranged for Nathan to marry Sophia instead, the current Mrs. Reid.

To break them apart, the Reid matriarch threatened her own life. In the end, Nathan divorced Henrietta,and the family offered Henrietta two million as hush money.

Heartbroken, Henrietta didn't take a single cent. She left the Capitol City and moved to a remote rural area to teach.


Soon she discovered she was pregnant and raised the child alone. When Tristan was eight, Henrietta was diagnosed with lung cancer. Knowing her time was limited, she sent the boy back to the Reid family.

Three months later, that poor woman passed away.

Mrs. Jones' sigh trembled like old parchment. "If only you'd seen it, Madam. Since Master Tristan was reclaimed by the Reids, he'd turn to ice in that gilded cage. Mrs. Reid's barbs and young Master's little cruelties-he bore them all without a murmur."

She paused, her tone softening with pride. "But he's smart, you know? In those seven years, he finished elementary, middle, and high school. Got into Harvard's finance program and wrapped up his bachelor's, master's and PhD all in six years. Came back and took over the whole Reid Group. None of them could say a single word against him."

Megan listened in pained silence, her rib cage aching with each word.

Suddenly Zeta whirred, optic sensors flashing pink: "Adoring the boss = optimal life choice!Sweetness factor: 98%! Next phase: procreation protocol activated-prepare heir production!"
###Chapter 13 No More Mistakes
Megan crossed her arms and stared at Zeta. "Are you trying to read my mind?"

Zeta retracted its shiny metal rear and let out a creepy chuckle. "I simply picked up on your emotional indicators, Goddess. Judging by the current situation,I was just showing you the smart route. Oh, and Mrs.Jones agrees too."

Mrs. Jones: [Did it have to say it out loud?]

Her cheeks suddenly flushed. She cleared her throat and mumbled, "Uh... let's just start cooking,okay?"

At the principal's office of Meridian University.

The man sat back in a leather chair,legs crossed with effortless grace.

With a lazy smile, he said, "I heard you're planning to renovate the library?"

Principal Scott nodded, smiling. "Yes, that's the plan."

Tristan tapped his fingers on the chair's armrest."Renovating seems unnecessary. Why don't we just build a new one-300,000 square meters-on the open land to the south? Oh, and by the way, the equipment in your science center looks pretty outdated. Better import some cutting-edge tech from abroad." Principal Scott eyed the man like he was a gold mine wrapped in a well-cut suit-but knew there was no such thing as a free lunch.

He chuckled, "Mr. Reid, you're truly a patriot for the nation's education. Students across the country will remember your generosity. If Meridian University can be of any help to you in the future,you have my word -I'll do my best."

Tristan, mid-tap, suddenly stopped. His eyes lifted slightly, lips curving. "No need to wait for the future.I've got something in mind right now."




Tristan returned to Dreamscape Manor.

The moment he stepped through the door, Zeta came zooming in. "Master's home! Master, shoes! Master,Zeta missed you so much..."

Tristan shot it a cold glance and swiftly bypassed it,heading straight toward the small woman whose soft smile greeted him like sunshine. He scooped her into his arms without a word.

That eerie chuckle came again from Zeta. "Master's heart rate is hitting 100 bpm. Hormones spiking.Impulses suggest a strong desire to engage in...advanced human bonding. Let's celebrate human reproduction! Zeta's gonna meet the little master soon!"

Tristan's forehead twitched. What the actual hell is this thing?  His narrowed eyes glinted with a warning as he said in a frosty tone, "Say one more word and you're scrap."

Zeta vanished so fast it left an afterimage.

Megan burst into laughter. "Alright, everybody's hungry, right? Mrs. Jones made a feast. Let's eat."

Tristan leaned close to her ear, gently biting her ear lobe. "I'm starving. Seriously."

A blush crept down her neck, and she gave his chest a playful tap. "Stop it."

He finally let go, laced his fingers with hers, and led her to wash up before heading to the dining room.

Mrs. Jones served their food, then quietly excused herself.


Tristan piled glazed carrots atop her bone china plate until they threatened to avalanche. "Indulge, my little sparrow. Those wings need more than air to soar."

Megan tapped her fork against the gilded rim."Planning to roast me like your Christmas goose?What if I swell till my diamond rings cut off circulation?"

He caught her wrist, thumb brushing the pulse point."I'd commission new jewels for every soft curve. But vanish again..." A dangerous glint lit his eyes."

She set down her fork and cupped his handsome face."Tristan, I'm not going anywhere. Ever again."

"I believe you," he said quietly, gripping her hands."Which is why on Monday, you're going back to Meridian University for your classes. Second year.  Fashion and jewelry design."

"Really?"

Watching how her eyes lit up, Tristan nodded and gave an almost apologetic smile. "I mean it. I'm sorry I made you take half a year off."

Megan shook her head. "Don't say that. If I hadn't been tricked into judging you, I would've seen how good you've been to me... all your care and love."

"But you went out just now-was it for this?"

"Yeah. Don't worry, I already sorted things out with the school. Just focus on your studies."

"Thanks, Tristan." She leaned in and gave him a quick kiss at the corner of his lps.

"Call me honey."

Megan clicked her tongue playfully. "You are kinda old,you know? You're six years older than me."

Tristan pulled her into his arms, leaned close to her ear. His breath brushed across her pale neck, warm and ticklish. "As long as I'm still in shape, age doesn't mean a thing."

Watching her chew on her lip till it turned rosy-white,he couldn't help the grin tugging at his mouth.

That afternoon, Tristan headed back to the office for a last-minute meeting.

Megan stood by the window, watching the Maybach roll out of sight before turning back into the room.  She sat at her desk, plugged in her headphones, and played the intercepted call.

Wyatt: "What's up, babe?"

Molly: "Wyatt, your grandpa's birthday is next Saturday.

That b*tch will be there too."

Wyatt: "What do you wanna do?"

Molly: "Obviously get rid of the old man first, start some drama! I heard she knows the legendary hacker -if that's true, don't you think she could take down Reid Corp? Then we'd swoop in and win without doing anything."

Wyatt: "Sounds good. Tell me the plan."

Molly: "Okay, the plan is."

Megan ripped off her headphones, her eyes cold as ice.

In her past life, Molly had leaked a video showing 'Tristan' injecting air into Bernard's IV at the hospital.The guy in the video looked just like Tristan-same height,same build.

That had completely broken Megan. And with MMolly fanning the flames.

She'd lost herself in anger and made a fatal mistake-dragging Reid Corp down with her.

She wasn't going to let history repeat itself.

A sly smirk curled on her lips.
###Chapter 14 She's Back-and Married
That night, Tristan didn't get back to Dreamscape Manor until late.

Megan was already fast asleep.

He changed into pajamas, gently lifted the blanket and slid into bed, carefully pulling her into his arms.

But even that small movement woke her up.

She rubbed her eyes, her voice soft and sleepy."You're back? Did you eat?"

"Yeah, grabbed something. I also got in touch with Brandon Lewis.He'll be back mid-September to check on Grandpa."

Her eyes flew open,joy lighting up her face."Really?That's amazing! Grandpa might get better."

She wrapped her arms around his waist and snuggled closer. "You're the best, babe."

Tristan tilted her chin up, eyes glinting. "Darling,Capitol City requires a 3-day cooling-off period after license application." His thumb brushed her lower lip."By the time the bureaucrats stamp approval..."

She huffed. "So we wait?"


"Justice doesn't wait." His phone lit up with a federal judge's contact. "Judge Callahan owes me for saving his election. One emergency motion later..." He swiped open a court order PDF stamped EX PARTE WAIVER. "...Capitol Family Code §420 waived. Our license gets printed tomorrow morning."

Megan squinted at the judicial seal. "You had a federal judge kill a state waiting period?"

"Darling," he captured her hand, pressing it over his heart, "I'd have him overturn gravity if you asked. Now -Say 'l do', Babe."

"| do,I do..."
A
Tristan rolled over and pinned her beneath him,staring into her eyes. "I am the happiest man in the world. Let me give my wife a proper kiss."

Moments later, he dragged himself away from Megan's bedroom with leaden limbs, teeth gnashing against the ache in his gut. After locking the door behind him with a rattling hand, he turned the shower knob to its coldest setting-the icy cascade a necessary antidote to the fever that had left him trembling between duty and desire.

The next mnorning greeted them with warm sunshine.

The sleek black Maybach glided to a stop before the Capitol's Civil Affairs Bureau. As the door clicked open,a polished leather shoe touched the pavement with absolute poise. Megan emerged, radiant in ivory lace that gleamed like morning sun on fresh snow. Tristan followed, his charcoal suit impeccably tailored, and offered his arm. "Shall we, Mrs. Reid?" he murmured,

 his voice a velvet promise.

They ascended the marble steps together, the air humming with anticipation. Inside, a sharp-eyed clerk glanced up, recognition flashing across his face. "Mr.Reid! Your application is prioritized." He gestured towards a private ceremony room,its arched windows framing Capitol City's awakening skyline.

As the clerk began the vows, Megan's fingers tightened around Tristan's. "I plight my troth to you,"she declared, gaze fierce, "through boardrooms and battlegrounds." Beneath her hand, Tristan's low laugh resonated. "I vow to dismantle every obstacle," he countered, sliding the platinum band onto her finger,"to champion your ambition."

Outside,wedding bells mingled with the stirring city,heralding the first ###Chapter of a legacy forged in passion and power.





The Shaw family villa.

A sleek black Maybach pulled up out front.Elliot Shaw and Diane Hartwell hurried outside-after all, a car with the license plate ending in 888 could only belong to Tristan Reid.


As soon as Diane laid eyes on Megan, tears welled up and spilled over. Etiquette forgotten, she ran over and wrapped her daughter up in a long overdue embrace.

"Megan,sweetheart, I missed you so much! You little rascal, why didn't you come see your mom sooner?" Megan hugged her back tightly. "I missed you too,Mom.Really,really missed you."

Flashes from her past life stormed back-those gruesome photos Molly had shown her. Her parents,their throats slit, their blood soaking into the floor until it met the doorstep.

And little Chloe. first violated, then murdered, cut open in the most horrific way.

So when she said "missed you," it wasn't just about being locked up in Dreamscape Manor. It was the aching, raw relief of knowing her family was still alive.

By her side, Tristan cast his gaze down. That's on him.He had imprisoned her back then.

Elliot,smiling, nodded at Tristan. "Mr. Reid."

Then to Diane, he gently scolded, "She's finally back.Stop crying and get inside."

Inside the villa, Diane clung to Megan's arm while they sat down on the couch. Tristan and Elliot sat in armchairs nearby.

Diane squished Megan's cheeks, her smile sharp at the edges. "Look at you-filling out! Must be living large at that fancy manor, huh?" She pinched Megan's waist playfully. "So cozy you ghosted your own mom?"

Elliot snorted, tugging Diane back. "Pshh,lay off her!Since when you got a problem with our kid being happy?"

Megan tilted her head."Let me guess. Molly told you  that?"


Diane dabbed at her tears. "Yes, Molly said that when she came back."

Megan's smile chilled a degree. Typical Molly-always the master distractor, stirring the pot however she could.

"Oh wow, sis,you and Tristan are back."

Molly's sweet voice rang out as she stepped gracefully into the room, handbag dangling on her arm.

She kept her usual smile on and took a seat on the long couch across from Megan.

Megan looked at Molly, then at Tristan, and said to everyone: "I have good news to announce. Tristan and I are legally married."

"What?" Molly couldn't hide her shock. Her voice spiked a little too much for her liking, so she quickly chuckled,"Oh,I mean-congrats to you both!"

Megan's eyes drilled into Molly, cold as ice. "Hey Molly,"her voice was tight, "did you spin some story to Mom and Dad about me? That I was living it up at Dreamscape Manor for six whole months, couldn't be bothered to see them? Is that the crap youfed them?"
###Chapter 15 The Mask Comes Off
Molly's smile cracked a little as she tugged at the corner of her lips. "Well, weren't you just living it up there?"


She shot Tristan a quick look, like,what,was she supposed to say she'd been locked up?

Megan narrowed her eyes, cold as ice. "I had aphasia the past six months. I was afraid to make them worry,so I didn't come back. But you? You told them I was partying it up. Seriously, Molly, what's your deal?"

Molly clutched her handbag tighter, knuckles white.Her face flushed then paled, nerves all over the place.

Damn that Megan. Aphasia? Just perfect-explains the silence, the missing daughter act.

She wanted to say Megan had been locked away by Tristan, but she didn't dare. The man sat there like some untouchable king, his presence heavy and fierce.One glance at him and she caught the storm brewing in his eyes, like he could crush anything in his path.

Molly bit her lip hard and tried to salvage things. "I-I didn't want Mom and Dad to worry about you being sick."

Megan let out a cold snort."So now I know why no one ever visited me at Dreamscape Manor. You made me seem like some spoiled slacker who only cared about luxury."

Diane Hartwell shot up from the couch. She stormed past the coffee table and slapped Molly straight across the face.

The sharp crack echoed through the massive living room.

Molly's hand flew to her burning cheek, her eyes already brimming with tears. "Mom."

Diane gritted her teeth, her voice shaking with fury."Don't call me that. I didn't raise a daughter who stirs up drama and plays everyone. We took you in and this is the thanks we get?"

Then she turned to Elliot. "And you think we still owe some kind of favor? After all these years? This girl's been nothing but trouble since she entered this house at five! I've spent the last six months thinking my own daughter didn't want me anymore. Turns out Molly here's been stirring the pot the whole time."

Elliot frowned. "Alright, enough, let's not go on. Ifit was all a misunderstanding, now it's cleared up. Don't forget, if it weren't for Godfrey taking that bullet for me back then, I wouldn't even be alive."

Diane Hartwell wasn't having it. "Elliot, Godfrey was your bodyguard. He took a fat paycheck to protect you-risking his life was part of the deal. But answer me this: who's really your flesh and blood? Looks to me like Molly's got you wrapped around her finger."

"What nonsense are you talking?!" Elliot stood up abruptly. "Watch what you say in front of the kids."

Diane let out a cold snort. "Every day it's 'Molly this,Molly that' like she's your reaI daughter. Who knows what shady stuff's going on when nobody's watching."

"Enough!" Elliot's hands balled into fists, breath coming hard and fast.

"Well, well, who's yelling like that?" A clear voice rang out as a young girl with two ponytails walked into the villa.

She had fair,flawless skin and adorable dimples at the corners of her lips. The moment she saw Megan sitting on the sofa, her backpack slipped right from her hand.

Then a grin of disbelief bloomed on her face.

Chloe didn't so much run as launch herself at Megan.

"Sis! Oh my god, I've missed you so much.Your phone's been off, I couldn't reach you at all. Molly said you were living it up at the villa-were you just avoiding us?"


As she spoke, tears spilled down her cheeks.

Megan gently patted her back. "Get up first,we can talk."


"Oh, right."

Chloe stood, helping Megan to her feet.

Megan raised her hand to wipe away the tears from  Chloe's little face. "I lost my voice. Been getting treatment out at the manor these past six months.I told Molly to let everyone know... didn't think she'd twist the truth."

Chloe's cheeks flushed crimson, her eyes blazing as she whirled on Molly. "I thought you were my real sister! Mom and Dad treated you like their own daughter! And this is how you repay us? Trying to rip our family apart?" Her voice dropped to a venomous whisper."You know what? You've always been twisted.I remember when Megan was eight-down with that awful flu, on antibiotics. You gave her a Hot Toddy!Whiskey,honey,lemon,the whole thing! She ended up in the ER getting her stomach pumped!"

"Megan begged me not to tell," Chloe choked out,her hands trembling. "Said she didn't wvant you punished. Back then I thought she was just soft-hearted.Now? Now it makes my blood run cold."

Diane's face went ashen. Her hand shot out, finger trembling violently as she pointed at Molly. "She told us. she swore she'd just eaten too much candy. All these years. it was you."

Molly shook her head desperately, tears welling. "No!I swear | didn't k<now! She was so sick, shivering. I just wanted to help her feel warm, like my grandma used to do for me! I had no idea. no idea alcohol and antibiotics could do that."

As she spoke, she dropped to her knees with a thud and started crawling forward, sobbing. "Mom, please  forgive me! I swear it wasn't on purpose!"

Then she looked to Megan, tears streaming down."Megan, I really didn't mean it."

Megan gave a faint smile. "Mm, yeah. You didn't mean it."

Molly bobbed her head rapidly. "Right, right! You believe me, don't you,Megan?"

"Heh." Megan let out a cold little laugh. "Yeah, except.you totally did."

She rose slowly, circling Molly's crumpled form like a hawk. "You want to know why I fled my own engagement party?" Her razor-sharp whisper sliced through the silence. "Every broken string leading back to that disaster-you were the one holding the scissors."
###Chapter 16 You Don't Belong Here
The spacious living room echoed with that one sentence.

Molly instinctively glanced at the man casually leaning against the back of the sofa.

His jaw was tight, eyes cold like a storm brewing under the surface.


With a faint curl of his lips, Tristan spoke slowly, "I'm curious-how exactly did you plan out this little drama of yours?"

Tears welled up in Molly's eyes as she bit her lower lip till it turned pale, "I didn't. I really didn't say or do anything."

Megan took a step forward, lowered herself slightly,and hooked a finger under Molly's chin. "Memory that bad already? You're young, you know. Let me jog it for you."

She let go of Molly's chin and straightened up, arms behind her back. "You kept getting in my head,painting Tristan as this possessive, selfish control freak.You wanted me scared of him, didn't you? Then you fed me the idea to ditch the wedding."

Megan continued, "And just when I ran, conveniently,  a car was waiting. I was desperate, jumped in thinking I was safe, headed straight for the airport-but guess what? There was something in the scent inside the car.Knocked me out cold. Next thing I knew, I woke up to see Tristan. If he hadn't shown up when he did, I don't even want to think about what would've happened."

Molly remembered exactly what she said to her back at the Dreamscape Manor-that it was Tristan's men who took her and dragged her back. And Megan used to believe every bit of it. So how did everything flip all of a sudden?


She couldn't understand what changed. The driver wasn't supposed to spill-his whole family was under her thumb. But ever since Megan saw her the day before yesterday,she was totally different. She didn't trust her anymore. She believed Tristan now?

How could someone go from hating a guy to falling for him like flipping a switch?

Tears streamed down Molly's face as she sobbed like she'd just endured the worst injustice on Earth.

Tristan's eyes narrowed dangerously, his fingers tapping rhythmically on the sofa's armrest. "Tell me-what do you think I should do with you?"

Molly's eyes widened in panic. "I didn't do anything terrible! This is al a misunderstanding!"

She scrambled toward Elliot, grabbing onto his pant leg. "Dad, please, believe me! You and Mom treated me like l was your own. How could I ever betray that?" Elliot's brows furrowed deeply. "Molly, you're nineteen now. You're an adult. You need to learn to stand on your own."

Her crying stopped abruptly. "Dad. what are you saying?Are you kicking me out?"

Elliot let out a slow, tired sigh. "I'll buy you an apartment near the university. It's time you moved out."

Megan lifted a brow slightly. "Molly, your time as the second miss of the Shaw family is over. A crow won't become a swan."

Molly sank to her knees, utterly crushed, like the air had been sucked out of her world.

She couldn't figure out-where did everything go wrong?



How did the idiot who used to hang onto her every word suddenly slip away from her control?Megan walked right up to her, tilted her head with a faint smirk, and said, "See you Monday at school."

"School?" Molly mumbled, caught off guard.

Megan smiled sweetly. "I'm really looking forward to being classmates again." Oh, the show's just getting started.


She turned and strolled back to Tristan's side. "Babe,let's go. No need to let garbage ruin our mood.We just registered today-shouldn't we celebrate a little?"

Tristan stood up, straightened his coat sleeve, then took her hand gently. Facing Diane Hartwell and Elliot, he gave a respectful bow. "Megan and I got married today.From now on, we're family. If there's anything you need, just let me know-l'll do everything I can.We're planning to have the wedding on Megan's birthday. We've still got plans today, so we won't stay long. If you miss Megan, you're always welcome at Dreamscape Manor."

With that, he took Megan's hand and headed for the door.

Elliot, Diane, and Chloe followed to see them off.

Megan turned to glance back at them. Then, with a quick look to Tristan, she said, "Hang on."

She hurried back and wrapped both Diane and Chloe in a tight hug.

After a long moment, she looked at them with watery eyes and whispered, "I'm really happy to see you both again." This time, I'll protect you no matter what.

She gave Elliot a small smile before walking back toward the man waiting patiently for her.

Tristan slipped an arm around her waist and whispered,"You skipped hugging your dad."

Megan looked up with a teasing smile. "Thought you might get jealous."

He chuckled. "Jealous? Of your dad?"

"Really? Then why's his name mysteriously missing from my contacts?"

Tristan coughed lightly. "Maybe I. accidentally deleted it?"


Megan raised a brow. "Want me to go hug him now to make up for it?"

Before she could move, he quickly pulled her into the car,opened the passenger door, and settled her in.Then he walked around and got into the driver's seat.They drove off into the distance.

Back at the door,Molly leaned against the frame,nails digging into her palms so hard they almost pierced skin.


She hadn't expected Megan to flip the script on her like that.

That useless girl-how dare she act all high and mighty now!

She bit down so hard her veneer cracked, lashes trembling slightly.

She swore she'd make Megan pay-pay so bad she'd wish she were dead.

Seeing the three of them walk towards her,her eyes filled with tears within seconds.


"Dad.Mom.Chloe."

Elliot just let outa heavy sigh and walked right past.

Diane shot her a frosty glare. "Still here after everything you did? Got some nerve."

Chloe flicked a strand of Molly's hair and clicked her tongue. "Molly, next time you see us, maybe try a detour. And drop the 'Shaw family heiress' label,yeah?You don't deserve it."She took a few steps forward,turned her head, and said coldly, "Take everything that's yours and leave the rest alone. Don't go sticking your hands where they don't belong-like coveting someone else's man. That kind of dream? Not happening in this lifetime."

With that, she gave a scoff, her twin ponytails bouncing as she turned and climbed the stairs.

Molly's eyes narrowed like a venomous serpent's,their darkness laced with hatred. She absolutely loathed everyone in this family.

One by one, she wanted them to pay.

Especially that little one.

So pretty,huh? She was going to ruin that face.




A sleek black Maybach was parked on the coastal highway.

Tristan halted their beach stroll, waves kissing the shore as he turned Megan to face him. His hand dipped into his pocket, retrieving not a box, but a slender velvet pouch. Kneeling in the sand, the sunset gilding the sharp planes of his face, he poured its contents into his palm: a platinum necklace, its pendant a single diamond suspended like a captured star.


A wry smile touched his lips. "Cliché? Maybe. But nothing else felt worthy of this moment." His thumb brushed the cool stone. "I bought this the week after we met. Knew then-you were the one I'd spend lifetimes finding."

"When you ran from the engagement..." His voice roughened. "I thought I'd lost the right to ever put this around your neck."

He lifted the chain, the diamond catching fire in the dying light. "Thank you for letting me finally bringit home. Megan Reid... thank you for choosing me.l swear my life to loving you, protecting you,holding you closer than my own breath."

Tears glistened on Megan's lashes as she smiled.She swept her hair aside, exposing the vulnerable curve of her neck. "My honor," she whispered. "And my vow to guard your heart as fiercely." This time, I won't fail you

Tristan fastened the clasp, his fingers lingering against her skin. Then he drew a smaller pouch from his pocket. Inside lay two delicate braided bracelets, one slightly wider than the other.

"Tomorrow," he murmured, securing the slender bracelet around her wrist, "when you're on campus..this won't shout like the necklace might." He traced the intertwined 'T&M's woven into the design."Our mark.Always with you."

Megan took the wider bracelet. Her fingers brushed his pulse point as she clasped it around his wrist.

Tristan reached up,whisking away a strand of hair from her face, thumb brushing lightly over her cheek."Megan, I love you. From the moment I saw you,l knew it had to be you-forever."

She bit her lip, smiling, "And when exactly was that first time?"

He traced her bottom lip with his thumb, the memory clear in his mind-her, breathless in his arms.

He chuckled softly. "A long, long time ago... You already had a place in my heart back then."
###Chapter 17 Say It Again:I Love You
Sometimes fate really just sneaks up on you

Megan was still wondering when exactly she'd found her way into Tristan's heart, when his fiery kiss totally messed with her train of thought.

Then came the sudden buzz of a phone, shattering the sweet moment.

With a frown, Tristan pulled his phone out-Kevin Ward was calling.

Holding the phone at arm's length, he answered.

"Tristan! Drinks tonight at Prestige! Kai's back in town!"

Tristan didn't even hesitate. "Not going."

And with that, he hung up.

But Kevin clearly wasn't done. The screen kept lighting up like the guy didn't get the hint. Tristan was about to block him.

"Just go, your friend's back. It's fine," Megan said with a light chuckle.

Tristan held her hands between his. "Then come with me. I want you to meet them properly."

Megan nodded sweetly.

Just then, more buzzing. Tristan's brows furrowed  when he saw the caller ID-Old House.


He picked it up.

"Tristan, heard you got registered this morning. Come over for dinner tonight," said Nathan's voice.

Before Tristan could speak, the other side rushed to add, "Your grandpa's looking forward to meeting your wife."

Tristan's face darkened. Playing the grandpa card?

Geoffrey was the only one in that whole family who'd ever genuinely cared about him.

With clear annoyance,he replied,"Got it."

After hanging up, he looked at Megan. "So word spread fast. Looks like we're headed to the old house.We'll say hi to Grandpa, then bounce."

Megan narrowed her fox-like eyes. This had Molly and Wyatt written all over it. No way this news traveled that fast on its own.

She gave a little smirk. "It's alright. If your grandpa's good to you, we should go see him."

They left the beach and got on the road to the Reid family estate.

In the car, Tristan seemed to want to say something but hesitated. Finally,he spoke.

"Megan, I am not actually the legitimate heir of the Reid family."

He glanced her way, trying to feel out her reaction Her eyes were calm, no trace of judgment.

Encouraged, he went on, "My mom, Hannah,married my dad on paper, but because she came from nothing my grandma never accepted her. They ended up getting divorced. Mom left the Capitol City and went to a rural town to teach. That's when she found out she was pregnant."

Tristan choked up, his eyes seemed slightly moist, and he continued, "She had me anyway. We didn't have much, but we were happy. Then, when I was eight, she got lung cancer. She sent me back to the Reids and quietly passed away alone. She didn't take any help from my father. Three months later, she was gone.The funeral was just me and him."

Tristan's voice softened, tinged with anger. "I hated him for a long time. Felt like he never truly loved her.That he cared more about the family name than about her.After that,he married into the Carter family."

He clenched his hands tightly, then looked at Megan said slowly, "So... things between me and him were never great."

Megan reached over, squeezing his right hand.

"Everyone's got an inner scale. Balancing love,friendship, family-and gain. Not everyone gets it right.Some people lean more into feelings, sacrificing benefits, but gaining warmth. Others chase advantage,and end up emotionally empty. Life doesn't favor anyone. Who knows, maybe your dad hasn't had it  easy either."

Megan noticed a hint of contempt and anger in Tristan's eyes, so she gently stroked his hand and comforted him, "I'm not saying you're supposed to forgive him. Or feel better because he might be miserable. I just want you to let go of that bitterness,even just a little. So you can be happy, too."

She gently stroked Tristan's face, her heart full of love "You've got me. I'm not going anywhere."

"You're not gonna look down on me for where I come from, are you?"he asked.

This man, this business tycoon who dominated boardrooms, was suddenly so unsure-like a kid afraid of being left behind. He was that scared of losing her.Megan let out a soft sigh and leaned her cheek against Tristan's arm.

"From now on, no matter if you're rich or broke,healthy or not, I won't leave you. Silly, I love you,l Love for who you are-not for what you have."

The moment Tristan heard her say that last part, he froze for a second. She just said she loved him.


He quickly switched lanes and pulled over on the side of the road.

Grabbing her by the shoulders, he asked, "Megan,say that again."

She pinched his handsome cheek and smiled. "Tristan,I love you. Maybe it feels sudden to you, but for me.l  just don't want to miss out on you anymore. I'm in this with you,for life."

He pulled her into his arms, holding her like she was the only light breaking through the storm in his world.She was his saving grace. And he? He was hers too.





Reid family estate.

A sleek black Maybach rolled to a stop in front of a three-meter-high iron gate with intricate designs.After the license plate was scanned, the gate opened automatically.

They drove past a path flanked by manicured lawns and circled a fountain before stopping in front of a European-style mansion.

Tristan got out first and opened the car door for Megan,helping her out gently.Fingers interlocked,the two walked toward the main house.


Suddenly, Tristan's brows knitted together as he yanked her into his arms.

A fast-flying golf ball zipped past Megan's head,slamming into the gate behind them with a loud "bang."

If it had hit just a second later, it would've nailed the back of her head.


"You okay?" he asked.

"I'm fine," Megan said, shaking her head

The two followed the path of the golf ball and locked eyes with a tall, sharp-featured man walking toward them with a club in hand.

His eyes had a hint of cold cruelty, and his sharp nose gave him a calculating, almost sinister look.

"Well, big bro's back," he mocked. "And look who we have here-the runaway fiancée herself!"

Wyatt. Tristan's half-brother. The same bastard who,in a poast life, helped Molly take Megan's life.

Tristan's gaze turned icy cold. He let go of Megan and strode straight toward Wyatt.

"Why so mad, Tris-"	八、

Before he could finish, Tristan had him by the neck,lifting him off the ground.

Wyatt raised the club, trying to strike Tristan, but his arm was pinned midair the next second.

Tristan's grip tightened.

Wyatt's face turned crimson, eyes bulging, blood vessels popping.

Between gritted teeth, Tristan growled, "Try that again,and I swear I'll end you."

Then he flung Wyatt down onto the lawn and slammed the golf club across his body.

Once. Twice.

From where she stood, Megan watched coldly, like she'd been thrown back into her past life-Wyatt plunging that icy blade into her chest.

Her stare was blank, emotionless. When Wyatt finally coughed up blood, and the club was just an inch away from smashing his skull, Tristan stopped, hovering the club midair.

"Got it?" Tristan's voice was like frost.

Wyatt coughed hard,wiped the blood from his mouth,and stammered, "Y-yeah, I got it."

Megan walked over and stood beside Tristan,looking down on Wyatt like he was nothing more than filth.

With a smirk, she said, "Babe, the place is impressive,but the staff really need some training. You'd think someone would've taken out the trash by now. The stench here really calls for a little air freshener."

Tristan wrapped an arm around her waist and led her toward the mansion."Yeah, a full retraining is in order."

Behind them, Wyatt glared at their backs with fury,punching the ground as rage burned through him.

Tristan always had the upper hand-but one day,he'd make him pay. And since he cared so much about that woman,she'd be the first to fall.

###Chapter 18 The New Power Couple
Before they even reached the front door, it flung open.

A well-dressed woman with an elaborate updo stormed out. After shooting a nasty glare at Tristan and Megan, she darted toward Wyatt.

"Oh my poor baby! What happened? You're coughing up blood?!" she cried dramatically, her voice shrill and full of sorrow. "Just look at his neck! Those bruises-he's covered in fingerprints!What kind of karmais this?!"

Her wailing was so over-the-top, it could've been mistaken for a funeral. The noise pulled everyone inside the house out to see what was going on.

Leading the group was Geoffrey Reid-the family patriarch-his silver hair sleeked back, eyes still sharp with age. He rested his hand upon his silver-topped cane as he emerged onto the porch

"Tristan's back? And this must be Megan?" he asked.

Megan gave a soft nod. "Nice to meet you, Grandpa."

"Good, good." His gaze drifted toward the lawn, where mother and son played out their dramatic scene-one on the ground, the other wailing like it was the end of the world.  "And what happened here?" he asked with a frown.

Tristan's face didn't show the slightest ripple. "Wyatt tried to hit Megan in the back of the head with a golf club. I simply gave him some discipline."

Sophia, still putting on her teary show, shuffled over like she couldn't keep it together. "Dad, you've got to say something! Wyatt's spitting blood! Look at him-there are fingerprints all over his neck! Tristan didn't just hit him-he went all out!"

Nathan Reid furrowed his brows, looking unimpressed."Stop exaggerating. Wyatt's a strong kid. Let him get checked out at the hospital and quit making a scene."

Sophia glared at Nathan with resentment in her eyes-but kept her mouth shut.

From the sidelines, the family's women started whispering to each other.

"Clearly, they're not born of the same mother. No closeness at all."

"Exactly! He really went too far! Kids born outside the main line always lack manners."

Megan's eyes sharpened, coldly locking onto the woman who just spoke.

"Come on, everyone knows Tristan's parents were married-it was just family politics that split them apart,"she said, tone icy. "If you don't even know what 'illegitimate child' means, stop pretending you're cultured. You're embarrassing yourself."  She slowly turned the wedding ring on her finger, her voice calm but cutting. "You know what they say,never forget where your blessings come from. You sure you're not taking this easy life for granted?"

The one she called out was Evelyn-Tristan's third aunt -in-law. She snapped back, looking honestly a little wronged. "Kids these days have no respect. Talking back to elders like it's nothing!"

Her husband, Harrison Reid, stepped up, his pride clearly stung. "Tch, now even outsiders can act like they own the place?"

Megan clutched Tristan's arm, eyes slightly misty,like she might cry. "Babe. they're calling me an outsider.That really hurts. I thought being married meant I was part of the family."

That hit like a thunderbolt. Everyone stood there stunned-hadn't she just put them all in their place?And now... she looked like the one being wronged?

Tristan's gaze was icy cold, an almost dangerous sharpness in his aura.

His eyes swept across the crowd, lips curling into a faint smirk that sent shivers down spines.

"Maybe y'all are holdinga bit too much of the company's shares," he said lazily.

The moment his voice dropped, several people gasped.



Geoffrey's eyes flicked toward Harrison and Evelyn.  "You two have been dropping by the main house an awful lot lately."

Translation: Don't bother showing up anymore.

Julian chuckled, trying to diffuse the tension."Tristan's wife just got officially introduced to the family today-no need to crowd the doorway, let's all head inside."

He tugged gently at his wife Pearl Bennett's arm.The woman forced a smile and said, "Yeah, it's Megan's first time visiting the house. Let's go inside and catch up."

But Megan hadn't forgotten how the woman just moments ago said they weren't close since they weren't born of the same mother. Acting nice now wouldn't change anything.

Mr. Reid turned to Nathan and instructed, "Go check on Wyatt's injuries."

Nathan gave a small nod and led Sophia over to help Wyatt.

Mr.Reid then looked at Tristan and Megan. "Come on,Tristan, Megan. Let's go inside."

As much as Megan disliked being in places like this,she knew some things couldn't be avoided.

Right now, her job was to stand by her man.

Inside the grand living room, Mr. Reid settled down on an ornate golden nanmu armchair. He stroked his greying beard, eyes warm as he looked at Megan. "Megan, there might've been some rough patches before, but I'm glad things worked out between you two in the end. This marriage, planned long ago with youur grandfather, turns out wasn't in vain."

With that, he pulled a red silk box from his pocket and handed it to Mr. Stewart beside him.

Mr.Stewart stepped forward and presented the velvet box to Tristan.

Mr. Reid gave a low chuckle, his gaze steady. "This brooch belonged to Tristan's grandmother. An Edwardian piece, set with emeralds and diamonds. It's been in the family for generations." He paused,his eyes resting on Megan. "We felt it fitting that Megan should wear it now."

As his words settled, Pearl Bennett and Evelyn exchanged a fleeting glance, their expressions unreadable save for a tightening around the eyes.

Tristan opened the box, revealing the antique brooch nestled within. The intricate platinum setting held vibrant emeralds encircled by shimmering diamonds,a testament to timeless craftsmanship.

He met his grandfather's gaze, his voice filled with understanding."Thank you,Grandpa.It's magnificent."

Megan's breath caught slightly as she looked at the heirloom. "Thank you, Grandpa," she said softly,her fingers lightly tracing the edge of the box."s an honor.I promise to cherish it."

Mr. Reid let out a hearty laugh. "Good! Excellent! From  now on, Tristan will take over my position as head of the Reid family. Megan will be our matriarch."

The head of the family had complete control over all business affairs and could revoke any delegated rights,including shares. Before, Tristan could only suggest taking back shares, and the recipient still had the option to plead with the family head.

But now? One word from Tristan, and it was final.

Julian and Harrison were clearly displeased. In their eyes, the old man had lost it-passing the family to a so-called illegitimate kid instead of his own sons.

Harrison clenched his fists. "Dad, does Nathan even know about this?"


Mr. Reid snorted. "Do I need anyone's permission to make decisions? Between you three,who comes close to Tristan's competence? Our family should be handed to someone who can actually handle it. Any objections?"

Evelyn muttered under her breath, "Dad clearly plays favorites... we've got another grandson, haven't we?"

Mr. Reid tapped his cane hard and snapped, "You mean Wyatt? That kid lives for food and parties. If he took over, we'd be bankrupt in no time. Anyone else got something to say?"

Everyone fell silent after that.

Satisfied, Mr.Reid nodded. Then he turned to Megan.

"I heard your grandfather's not doing well these days?"  Megan nodded. "We went to see him yesterday.He already had Alzheimer's, and now he's also been diagnosed with a brain tumor. Things aren't looking good."

Tristan added, "I've reached out to Brandon Lewis.He'll be back in about two weeks to examine Megan's grandfather."

"That's good to hear," Mr. Reid said with relief,waving at Tristan. "Come with me to the study, Tristan."

Then he glanced at a young woman in the corner of the couch. "Lina, take Megan around the estate for a bit."
 ###Chapter 19 He Poured,She Glowed

The girl stood up politely and nodded. "Yes, Grandpa."

Megan looked at the shy girl walking toward her-Lina Reid,Julian's daughter.From a past life, she vaguely remembered her. Lina had been classmates and close friends with Megan's sister, Chloe.

"Megan,want me to show you around a bit?"

"Sure."

They left the mansion and headed toward the man-made lake behind it. The lake shimmered in a soft green hue, with the breeze stirring gentle ripples across the surface.


"Megan, my mom sometimes talks without thinking.Don't take her words too seriously,okay?"

Megan smiled. "I wasn't really bothered by your mom today-just that third aunt's words were kinda outta line."

Lina let out a sigh. "She's been married into the Reids for years but never had kids. Uncle's never exactly lived like a saint either... so she's got a lot of pent-up anger and tends to take it out on everyone."

"She's like that with everybody, really. Just tune her out."


"Okay,got it."  "Lina!"


A crisp voice called out.

They turned and saw a girl in a bright red dress walking over, long black hair down to her shoulders, and a sweet-looking face that instantly caught attention.

Lina waved at her and whispered, "That's Rachel, my aunt's adopted daughter. She's about your age.They've been living in France, didn't expect her to show up today."

The girl stepped up, gave Lina a big hug, then turned to Megan. "And who's this?"

Lina smiled brightly. "Sis, this is Tristan's wife, Megan."

Rachel immediately hugged Megan, eyes bright and clear. "Hi! I'm Rachel."

Megan had never met her before. All those novels and dramas had made her cautious around characters like "adopted daughters"-you never knew if they had that fake sweet thing going on like Molly.

So she kept things polite. "Nice to meet you."

Before she could finish, Rachel already had an arm around her shoulder.

Then came the nonstop chatter, sounding more like a nosy aunt than someone her age. "Girl, what were you thinking, trying to run away from a wedding?Tristan is tall, handsome, stylish-every rich girl in town drools over him, and you almost passed him up?"

"You two finally got together now, huh? I mean, if you  hadn't bailed on the engagement six months ago,you'd probably be married by now."

"Shoot, maybe even have a baby cooking by this point."



Megan hadn't expected someone who looked so calm and sweet to have this kind of... bold personality.

She covered her mouth and laughed. "Six months ago I was clearly not thinking straight. Good thing I came to my senses."

"Well, glad you snapped out of it! But you best hold onto my brother tight-there are plenty of ggirls just waiting for a chance."

Rachel glanced at Megan's ring, then teased, "Sis, that rock on your finger is massive! I'm so telling my boyfriend he needs to up his game."

Lina just shrugged helplessly and followed after them.

After chatting a while, it turned out that Penelope Reid -Tristan's only aunt-wasn't planning to return to France. She'd brought Rachel back with her to settle down permanently in the Capital City.

Later back at the mansion, Rachel found Penelope chatting with Pearl and Evelyn.

Grabbing Penelope's arm, Rachel swayed it like a spoiled kid. "Mom, Megan's studying design over at Meridian University-I wanna apply there too!"

Penelope turned around and spotted Megan walking toward them.  The woman looked about forty, with an elegant face that barely showed signs of age-she could easily pass for thirty. Her gentle expression gave off a warm,welcoming vibe.

She walked over with a smile and held Megan's hands."You must be Megan. What a beautiful face you have.No wonder Tristan is so taken with you."

Megan blushed lightly, cheeks turning pink. "Thank you,Auntie."

Penelope glanced at the lively Rachel and said with a smile, "Rachel, you could learn a thing or two from Megan's calm demeanor. If you're serious about getting into Meridian University, you might want to ask Tristan for help."

Rachel chuckled, eyes gleaming with mischief. "Asking Tristan won't get me anywhere-I'll just stick to his sweet wife instead!"


With that, she suddenly lunged forward,throwing her arms around Megan in an exaggerated hug, even leaning in like she was about to plant a kiss on her cheek.


Before she could get close, Megan was swiftly pulled into a familiar, protective embrace-firm, possessive,and warm.


Tristan's low voice cut through the moment,calm but edged with danger. "Touch her again, and and you'll be in trouble."

Rachel blinked, then pouted dramatically.,come  on, Tristan. I'm a girl too!"

Tristan arched a brow, his hold on Megan tightening just slightly. "Doesn't matter. She's mine."

Rachel rolled her eyes and muttered under her breath,"Jeez.Possessive,much?"

She clasped her hands together, eyes sparkling as she looked to Megan. "Please,Megan?"

Megan met her gaze with a soft smile. "If Rachel wants to get into Meridian University too,it'd be nice to have a buddy in class with me."

Tristan looked at her dotingly and gently tousled her silky hair. "Alright, whatever makes you happy."

Rachel tugged at Lina beside her. "See that? Tristan actually smiles-like, full on sunshine and flowers."

Lina cleared her throat. "Right? First time I've seen it too. It's kinda surreal."


Just then, Mrs. Ford came over and said, "Young Master, everything's ready. Lunch is served."

With an arm wrapped around Megan's waist, Tristan casually led her toward the dining room.

As they walked, he said in that lazy drawl, "The chef here's Michelin three-star. If you like his cooking,I'll just have him moved to our place."

Megan hesitated, "Isn't that a bit much?"

Tristan looked at Megan lovingly and replied, "As long as you like it, who cares?" Geoffrey had just stepped out of the study and caught that last line.

Geoffrey:[Guess I've been replaced by his wife now.]

Everyone else:[Yep, we're all officially sidelined.]

Tristan:[l only care about my wife. If she's happy,that's all that matters.]

The round dining table was packed with famnily.

Tristan reached for the wine bottle and poured Megan a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, his movements smooth and unhurried. He even topped it off with a gentle swirl, then handed it to her with a soft smile.

Rachel, sitting nearby, fluttered her lashes. "Tristan,don't I get a little love too? MMy glass is feeling awfully empty."

He gave her a cool glance, picked up a bottle of sparkling water, and poured it into her glass instead."There. Bubbly-just like you."

Rachel blinked.Her cousin-the famously aloof Tristan -had actually poured her a drink? Even if it wasn't wine, it was... something.

Lina nearly choked on her sip of wine, then burst out laughing.

"What now?" Rachel asked, narrowing her eyes.

Lina leaned in with a smirk. "Sparking water. Zero alcohol, zero depth-just fizz and noise. Translation?He's politely telling you to chill."

Rachel forced a smile and sipped the water like it was  Dom Pérignon, pretending not to care. But inside?

Yep. Tristan was savage as ever.

By the end of lunch, everyone was stuffed-not from the food, but from the nonstop sugar overload between Tristan and Megan.

Later, Tristan took Megan to his old room in the mansion.

He opened the door, revealing a sleek black-and-white design, all clean lines and minimalist vibes.

Holding her hand, he led her in and shut the door behind them.


"I lived here from eight to fifteen. Then I left for the U.S., but someone's always been keeping it clean.

Let's chill here for a bit. We'll head to the Prestige later tonight."

Staring at his ridiculously handsome face,Megan couldn't help blushing at the thought of all the "newlywed" things they could finally do now that they were officially married.

Tristan traced her jawline lightly and whispered,"You know, your name's right next to mine now-on paper and in life."

Megan's eyes sparkled. "And I signed it with my whole heart."

She tiptoed and kissed his lips.

Tristan, never one to resist her, pulled her tightly into his arms.  They tumbled onto the fresh-scented bed, wrapped in each other's warmth.
###Chapter 20 The Matriarch's Mark
He looked down at the sweet little woman clinging to his neck,obedient and soft.


That coy expression of hers was seriously messing with his head.


He leaned in, gently kissing her flushed lips, lingering a bit longer than necessary.

"Knock knock knock!"

The untimely knock on the door immediately killed the mood.


Tristan let out a low sigh and buried his face into the crook of her neck, breathing in the light floral scent clinging to her skin.

Desire still lingered in his eyes as he walked to open the door with a darkened expression.

The cold air from the opened door made Lina and Rachel,who stood outside,shiver a bit.

"You need something?"

Rachel raised the deck of cards in her hand."Hehe,we wanna play cards."

Tristan shot them a rather annoyed glare before striding out of the room.  The two sisters grinned and closed the door behind them, happily rushing in.

Megan was standing by the tall window, gazing out at the view.

They instinctively glanced at the bed-neatly made,not a wrinkle in sight.

Lina breathed a quiet sigh of relief and raised her brows at Rachel, as if saying: nice,we didn't ruin their alone time.

Megan walked up and grabbed their hands. "Come sit."

Rachel's eyes casually roamed over Megan-until they landed on her neck. The smile on her face froze mid -curve.

"Hold up. is that a hickey?" she gasped, practically choking on her own words. "Right there on your neck -girl,my brain just short-circuited!"

Lina followed her gaze and let out a soft groan. "Oh no. Rae,your Meridian University is in danger."

Megan instantly realized what they were staring at.

That devil Tristan had definitely done it on purpose-like leaving a signature.

She suppressed the urge to groan, quickly reaching up to brush her hair over the mark, fingers grazing the sore spot.

Yep. That was gonna bruise.

Trying to play it off, she gave an awkward laugh. "Oh -uh,I burned myself with the curling iron this morning.  Total fail."

Rachel raised an eyebrow. "On your neck?"

Megan doubled down. "I was in a hurry. Wrong angle.It happens."

Lina and Rachel both gave her looks like yeah-right Who would buy that excuse?

"Didn't you wanna play cards?" Megan asked, breaking the awkward silence.


Rachel patted her chest proudly. "I'm actually really good at cards! Lina taught me Uno once, and boom-l became a legend. Come on, Megan, let's go."

And she wasn't bluffing-Rachel was ruthless.

She slammed down a Draw Four, followed by a Skip,then flashed her last card with a smug grin.

"Uno,baby."

Megan blinked. "Did she just reverse, skip, and nuke me in one turn?"


Lina shrugged, trying not to laugh. "We usually bet cocktails. Rae's luck is ridiculous."

Translation? If Lina didn't cheat once in a while,Rachel would have a personal bartender by now.

Megan gave Lina an amused side-eye. "Didn't peg you for the sneaky type."

She smiled. "Rae, promise me you won't play like this at school."


"Why not?"  Megan leaned in, all sincere and big-sisterly. "Think about it. You're lucky and good at the game-if you win too much, no one's gonna want to play with you anymore." Basically, keep it up and people will think you're clueless.

Rachel flashed a sweet grin. "Got it, Megan.""Just thinking about going to school with you tomorrow has me all excited," Rachel said with a grin. "Hey,how about me and Mom just move into Dreamscape?Makes things easier."

Lina cleared her throat. "Rachel, come on-they just got married. Don't go playing the third wheel."

Rachel's gaze shifted awkwardly to the faint mark on Megan's neck, then she chuckled. "Fair point."

Megan smiled softly. "It's really fine, if you two want to-"


Before she could finish, the door swung open.

Tristan stood there, expression unreadable. His voice was calm but firm. "'I've got a villa in Emerald Cove near the university. You and Auntie can stay there.I'll have someone prepare it now."

All three of themn turned to stare at him.

Had he been eavesdropping outside? That timing was just way too on-point.

Tristan glanced at his diamond-studded Rolex. "It's almost six. Let's head out. Kevin and Kai should be there already." Hearing Kai's name, Rachel shot up. "I'm coming too!"

Without waiting for permission, she bolted out the door and practically flew downstairs.

Lina, looking mildly stressed, murmured, "L...uh, still got homework. You two have fun." Then she quickly made her exit.

At the doorway, she turned back with a grin. "Best wishes on your marriage!"

Tristan pulled Megan close by the waist, fingers gently brushing the faint hickey on her neck. "Huh. I thought I only kissed it once. Why's it darker now?"

Megan gave his chest a light punch. "Ugh, you troublemaker! Now they're gonna get the wrong idea."

Tristan's laugh rumbled low and smooth."Oh come on -trouble looks good on you. Can't get enough of it."

She shot him a mock glare, cheeks burning. "How are you still laughing? I'm dying of secondhand embarrassment! You totally did that on purpose."

"Well,now they'll think twice before barging in.Maybe next time they'll remember what we might be 'busy'doing."

Megan felt her face practically boiling. "Let's just go.Rachel's already downstairs waiting."

Tristan chuckled lowly. "Someone's about to get a big headache."

Megan blinked up at him."Who?"

He leaned in and landed a quick, firm kiss on her lips. "Kai."

After saying a quick goodbye to Mr. Reid, the two headed out.


Just then, Nathan and Sophia were getting out of their car nearby.

Nathan approached. "Heading out now, Tristan?Megan?"



Tristan nodded coolly. "Yeah, got something to take care of."


Nathan smiled kindly at Megan. "Megan, make sure you two visit more often."

Megan returned the smile softly. "Of couse."

Tristan kept her hand firmly in his as they walked toward the car.

Rachel waved from the sidewalk. "Hi, Uncle! Auntie !"

As soon as the car unlocked, she darted into the backseat like she was afraid they'd ditch her.

Tristan walked around and opened the passenger side door, being the gentleman as usual for Megan.

But from the backseat came Rachel's voice in a whiny tone. "Megan, sit in the back with me!"

Tristan let out a quiet scoff. "Nope. She's with me."Tristan gently eased the little woman into the passenger seat and buckled her in like it was second nature.


Then he casually strolled around to the driver's side  and hopped in.

With a smooth turn of the wheel, the car sped off,vanishing around the corner, leaving behind nothing but a faint whiff of exhaust and frustration.

Sophia stomped her foot angrily. "Honey, did you see that? They don't even look at us like we exist!"

Nathan threw her a sideways glance, voice cold."Pretty sure you meant they don't respect you. Don't drag me into it."

Saying that, he turned and walked off toward the house.

Watching his back without a hint of warmth, Sophia's teeth clenched so tightly they almost cracked.

If it hadn't been for the drug she slipped him after they got married, he wouldn't have even touched her.

But that one night messed everything up-Wyatt happened.

She thought giving Nathan a son would at least make him change a bit, soften him up.

But no, he was like a damned freezer. Cold as ever.

Same went for Wyatt-never got a second of warmth.

She felt like a widow who never even got a wedding night out of her deal.

She couldn't help but wonder: what was the point of all that scheming, threatening her life just to land this lousy marriage?  She hated how he acted like she was invisible-and hated that woman, Hanjie, even more.

Thinking about how fast that woman died made her bitter-if she could do it over, she would've dragged it out longer.

Sophia caught up to Nathan and grabbed his arm. "Did you not see the brooch on her dress?”

Nathan's expression darkened. He yanked his arm back."So what?"


Sophia frowned. "That's the matriarch's brooch! lt means your father passed the position of head to Tristan! It should've gone to you-or at least to Wyatt!"

Nathan let out a short laugh. "Since Tristan took over,the company's profits have tripled here and overseas.

Reid Corp is now the biggest powerhouse in the country. All of that-his doing. He earned the title.You need to stop your delusional daydreaming. You're just a parasite-stick to that and quit stirring up trouble."

As his silhouette faded into the house, her fists clenched so hard her nails dug into her palms without her even noticing.

Moments later, Evelyn hurried over, brows furrowed with concern. "Sophia, how's Wyatt doing?"

Sophia let out a heavy sigh. "Soft tissue damage,ruptured spleen, fractured shoulder blade.

Tristan really wasn't pulling punches."

Evelyn's nostrils flared as she exhaled hard. "You've no idea, they actually gave the family heir title to that illegitimate son."

Hearing it out loud again made Sophia grit her teeth like she was going to bite something in half. "That brooch's already on that little tramp's dress. Like hell I didn't see it coming."

Evelyn looked like she'd just seen a bird crash into a window. "I tried speaking up for Wyatt to the old man,but he just snapped at me in front of everyone."

Sophia sneered, voice laced with venom. "I sent that bitch to her grave once-l can do it again!"

Evelyn glanced around quickly, clearly spooked."For the love of God, keep your voice down. That woman died of cancer, remember? We had nothing to do with it."


Sophia stared blankly into the distance, her gaze hollow but burning.

In her heart, she swore-whoever dared stand in her way,or her son's path, would not make it out unscathed.
 ###Chapter 21 Megan Strikes First


The Prestige Nightclub.

A sleek black Maybach rolled up to theentrance.

Tristan stepped out and opened the door for Megan, taking her delicate white hand and helping her out.

With one arm around her waist, he was ready to head in.

"Wait, Rachel hasn't gotten out yet."

Tristan glanced at the backseat. "She's got hands; and she can open the door herself."

Sure enough, watching the couple walk away without so much as a look back, Rachel huffed and pulled the door open on her own, hopping out to catch up.

Seriously, she'd just witnessed the definition of double standards in action.

She followed behind them, sulking.

The staff at the nightclub all greeted Tristan with deep bows, calling him "Mr. Reid."

He pushed open the door to private room 2121.

Smoke filled the room, swirling like a dream-or a bad hangover.

A red-haired Kevin bounced over, going in for a big hug.

But before he could make contact, a long slender finger pressed against his chest.

"Hands off, please. No touchy from strangers."

Brushing away some smoke, Kevin squinted and let out a gasp, eyes nearly popping. "Holy crap! Drama Queen incoming!" Instantly, the temperature in the room seemed to drop ten degrees.

Tristan's brows drew together. His voice turned ice cold. "Apologize."

Kevin scratched his head and grinned sheepishly. "MMy bad, My Queen. Come on in, make yourselves at home!"

Watching them head inside, he finally let out a breath.

Suddenly,pain shot up from his foot.

He looked down-someone else in a red dress had stepped right on him.

"Hey!Who-?"

Rachel looked over her shoulder with a dazzling smile. "Hi, it's me!"

Kevin instinctively glanced toward the guy sitting in the corner, giving him a sympathetic glance.

Bro...good luck,man.

He casually hit the smoke exhaust button, then slumped into a single lounge chair.

Soon, the misty vibe cleared, and the room breathed normal air again.

Tristan started with intros. "That guy in the corner with the not-so-memorable face? That's Kai Lee. His family runs the whole frozen food game in the country."

Kai raised his wine glass and nodded toward Megan. "Nice to meet you, Megan."

"And that lone soul over there? That's Kevin Ward. His family's in telecom hardware. Not that it matters for him,"

Kevin's mouth twitched. Saying Kai has a not-so-memorable face? Fine, maybe a bit harsh.

He looked back at the couch. The girl in red had already melted into Kai's arms like jelly.

Just then, Tristan finished him off with, "Honestly, he's just some random dude." Kevin pulled a face, rolled his eyes so hard they did a loop.

Then he switched tactics, pasted on a warm smile, and raised his glass toward Megan.

"This one's for you,Megan."

She nodded. "Good manners. Tristan and I are officially married."

"Pfft-!" Kevin choked, red wine spraying everywhere.

"No way! Congrats,though!"

Damn, weren't you fasting just two days ago?

Was this drama queen cooking up another twisted plan to mess with his buddy?

Not that he'd dare say that out loud.

Kai gently moved Rachel's head off his chest. "Congrats, you two."

Megan pressed her lips together, trying not to laugh. She'd been wary of Rachel before-young, pretty,adopted daughters don't exactly scream innocent.

But now?

It was obvious. Rachel had her eyes on Kai, no doubt.

Tristan leaned in, speaking low. "Rachel met Kai in France. She's been into him for two years. Came back to Verduria with her aunt this time... all for him."Megan didn't expect Rachel to be so hung up on Kai. Curious,she turned slightly to glance at Tristan and asked, "Wait, is he...you know, into guys?"

Tristan chuckled. "Nah, the Lee family's got an engagement lined up with the Banks family. You remember the girl with the green hair you saw last time?"

"You mean Natalie Banks?"

Tristan nodded. "Yep. The Lees would never let an adopted daughter officially marry in." Megan frowned slightly."Then what's Kai's deal? Doesn't like her but won't reject her either?"

Shaking his head, Tristan replied, "He does like her. He's just scared she'd get hurt. The Lee family's ruthless, and the Banks aren't pushovers either. It's easier to shield someone from open attacks-those sneaky ones are the real threat. And let's face it, Kai doesn't have the clout to protect her from both families right now."

Megan drew in a breath. "So what now?"

Tristan's gaze darkened. He picked up the lemon water from the table and took a sip. "Technically, that should be her man's job. But I'm not about to let anything happen to Rachel."

Of course, Megan thought. The "ice king" Tristan was a softie underneath.

Just then, Kevin strutted onto the dance floor like it was his personal stage and started showing off moves like he was auditioning for a backup dancer gig.

Kai rolled his eyes and walked out. Rachel instinctively followed after him.

As Kevin launched into a series of over-the-top dance moves-complete with finger guns and body rolls-Megan leaned over to whisper to Tristan, "I'm gonna slip away to the bathroom."

Tristan started to get up with her, but she quickly added under her breath, "Better if one of us stays. If we both leave, it's just Kevin dancing alone in the spotlight. that's secondhand embarrassment waiting to happen."

She made her way down the hallway, heading toward the restroom. Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed two people making out in a shadowy corner near the emergency exit.

She smirked. "Honestly, they kinda look good together."

After using the bathroom, Megan turned to head back.

That's when she noticed a bald guy dragging a familiar figure into a nearby private room. Her eyes narrowed.

Pigtails, small frame, school backpack-that was Chloe. In her past life, Chloe had been murdered. The mastermind? Molly. No doubt about it.

Originally, Chloe had gotten caught up in the whole mess after Bernard's murder.

But now? Things were unraveling sooner than expected. Molly wasn't even trying to hide her plans anymore.

And Megan couldn't help but blame herself-she hadn't kept a close enough eye on Molly.

If she wanted real-time updates on her moves, she needed to plant bugs and trackers ASAP.

Without hesitating, she bolted toward the room. Just as the door was about to close, she slammed her foot into it and kicked it wide open.

Inside, four sleazy-looking men were already lounging around. The bald guy turned, flashing yellow teeth and a sleazy grin. "Well, well, what do we have here? Another one walks right in."

Megan's eyes went ice-cold. So cold, it felt like even the air around her froze.

Her fists clenched so tight her knuckles cracked audibly. "Let the girl go."

The bald guy sneered, chucking the unconscious Chloe onto the couch toward the other men. Then he turned to Megan, cracking his neck. "Damn, look at that face, that body... You're a whole damn snack.C'mere, baby, let me show you a good time."

Megan smiled sweetly, lifting a hand with a "hold up" gesture. "Wait."

The guy paused, his eyes gleaming with greed.

Megan reached down and ripped her long dress with a quick"rrrip," turning it into a mini dress with one swift move.

The bald guy burst out laughing."Well damn, this chick's got some flair!"

The guys on the couch snickered too.

Wrapping the torn fabric tightly around her fists, Megan tilted her head and gave a mock-sweet smile."Flair? You mean stupid."
 ###Chapter 22 Babe,I was scared


Megan ducked under the bald man's swinging arm and with lightning speed, slipped behind him. Grabbing his shoulders, she kicked his lower back right at the spine.

In her past life, she ditched yoga for full-on Taekwondo and street fighting. Now a black belt, she knew exactly where to strike. The guy stumbled, smashed into the wall, and fell to his knees with blood spilling from his nose. "Damn it, I think my back's broken!" he howled.

Megan didn't pause. She darted forward and landed a solid left hook to his jaw. His body folded, head tilted,coughing out blood mixed with a couple of teeth.

Still defiant, the bald man slurred, "Get her! Finish her!"

Her stiletto heel pinned down on his neck. Face cold as ice, Megan stared down at him like a demon from hell. "Let the girl go, or l'll snap his neck right now."

The four other creeps shot up from the couch, charging straight at her.

Without blinking, Megan slammed her heel into the bald man's mouth-heel deep.

Someone threw a straight punch her way; she tilted her head slightly and yanked the guy's arm, flipping him over her back in a perfect shoulder throw. When another tried to grab her, she didn't hesitate-kicked him straight between the legs.

He dropped to the floor with a twisted, pained exporession that practically screamed regret.

Megan flashed a grin, "I call that move 'Instant Egg Explosion'"

The last two tried a pincer move. She snatched one by the hair, ran up the wall, and chopped his neck with pinpointprecision. Bam-down he went, limp.

Facing the final guy, she smirked, an eerie twinkle in her eye.

"C'mon, you scared or just lazy?" she taunted.He growled and lunged with a fist, only to freeze with it halted an inch from her porcelain face.

Just like that, knees buckled inward, and he collapsed weirdly.

Megan scoffed,"That one's called 'Sad Songs for the Eggs'."

Peeling off the wraps from her hands, she strolled toward the couch, where Chloe lay unconscious.

Right then, the door burst open.

Megan turned to see Tristan storm in with Kevin and Kai close behind.

Tristan's sharp eyes scanned her torn dress, exposing those insanely long, perfect legs. Then he glanced at the guys groaning or knocked out cold across the room. His gaze darkened-calm surface, but fullof bloodlust.

Kevin's mouth twitched. "Uh... who did all this?"

Kai and Rachel were too stunned to even speak.

There was only one untouched soul in the room-who else could it be?

The very next second, Megan ran into Tristan's arms with watery eyes and a trembling voice.

"Babe, I was scared." she whispered against his chest.

The conscious men on the floor: [You beat the crap out of us and you're the one scared?]

Tristan gently patted her back, his voice soft like coaxing a kid. "It's okay. Tell me what happened."

Megan blinked innocently. "I saw that bald guy dragging Chloe in here-she looked totally out of it.I panicked and followed. Then they all tried to... you know.I was scared."

Without a word, Tristan slipped off his blazer and wrapped it around her to cover her exposed legs.

"Don't worry. I've got this," he said gently, eyes still glinting with menace.

Then he turned to Kevin, voice low and commanding. "Take them to the basement." The Prestige Club had been Tristan, Kevin, and Kai's joint project five years ago.

And the place? Absolutely zero tolerance for gambling, prostitution, or drugs.

Break the rules, and you paid the price-painfully.Tonight, these five really hit a wall.

Barely thirty seconds after Kevin made a call, ten security guards in black suits stormed in.

With a turn of a hidden knob behind the couch, Kevin opened a concealed floor hatch-automatic sliding panels revealed a staircase leading underground.

The guards dragged the five men down without a word.

Tristan reached over and gently ruffled Megan's hair. "Kai will take you all to the guest suite on the seventh floor. I'll join you soon."

He glanced at Kai. "Take them to the private room. Ask Max Adams to come check Chloe's condition."

Kai gave a small nod. "Got it. Don't worry."

With that, Tristan turned and descended into the underground passage, Kevin following right behind.

The hidden floor panels slid shut again.

Kai strode over to the couch and carefully lifted the petite Chloe into his arms.

Megan and Rachel followed Kai out,heading to the seventh-floor suite.

Kai laid Chloe gently on the bed, then turned to Megan. "Her breathing's steady. Looks like she was just drugged. I'll get Max to double-check."

He then stepped out.

Rachel plopped down on the edge of the bed. "Megan, who's this girl you risked everything for?"

"She's my little sister, Chloe."

While replying, Megan opened a nearby backpack and pulled out a phone. Over a dozen missed calls-all from Diane Hartwell. Megan figured her mom must be panicking. She quickly tapped call back.

"Chloe! Where have you been? I've called like a million times and no answer!"

"Mom, it's Megan. Chloe's with me. We were dancing just now, didn't hear the phone. She will come back to Dreamscape with me tonight, so don't worry."

Diane let out a breath. "Next time, let Mom know first. You scared me half to death."

Megan gave a small chuckle. "My bad, Mom. I'Il make sure it doesn't happen again."

"Well, I know you just got your marriage registered today, but don't stay out too late, okay? It's your wedding night,after all."

Megan coughed lightly. "Uh-Mom, gotta go, talk later!"

She hung up in a flash, terrified her mom would say something even crazier.

"Megan, are you blushing?" Rachel stared at her with sparkling eyes. "Butto be fair, what Auntie said checks out. Even without a ceremony, technically... tonight's your wedding night."

She leaned in, oozing curiosity. "Come on, be honest-is it already happening between you and Tristan?"

Megan raised her brows and gave Rachel a gentle flick on the forehead. "Rachel, what sort of nonsense is filling that head of yours?"

Ignoring her, Megan started checking Chloe's recent contacts.

One unfamiliar number caught her eye.

She called it, only to hear: disconnected number.

Well, looks like the real answer would have to wait until Chloe regained consciousness-or maybe that bald guy in the basement would cough up something useful.

Meanwhile,in the basement.

Five men dropped to their knees in a row-two of them slouching strangely.
They were clearly in pain, but none dared make a sound.

They kept sneaking glances toward the leather sofa, where two men sat.

One of them? The legendary Tristan, known widely across the country. Ruthless in the boardroom-deadier outside of it.

The other? Kevin, Capitol's infamous wild card. Looks goofy but is anything but soft.

Tristan sat silently, his long, clean fingers tapping rhythmically on the armrest.

The soft "tap-tap-tap" sliced through the heavy air like a blade, each note a hammer to the kneeling men's nerves.

Then,the finger stopped. He slowly lifted his eyes.

A cold voice cut through the silence.

"So, how do you want to die?"
 ###Chapter 23 No One Touches His Wife


The basement was massive, enclosed on three sides by concrete walls. A harsh overhead light beamed straight down on the five men crouched below.

The second Tristan's icy voice cut through the silence, the five guys visibly cracked.

The bald guy stammered, lips trembling, "P-please, Mr. Reid... I just got a call, said there was a girl, totally free. Told me to wait outside Prestige. Then a van with fake plates pulled up and just tossed the girl-uh, the little girl-right in front of me."

Kevin arched his brow, chin lifted slightly."Check his phone. Find the number."

A bodyguard quickly frisked him, pulled out the phone, and started scrolling. He stopped at a contact and held it up for confirmation. The bald guy nodded furiously. "Y-yeah, that's it."

Kevin dialed back.

A robotic voice came through, "Sorry, the numnber you dialed is no longer in service..."

He turned slightly to glance at Tristan. "Disconnected."

The bald guy crumpled, his whole body folding down like jelly. "It was a setup... we're screwed!"

Kevin lit a cigarette, took one calm drag. "You recognize the driver?"

Tears instantly gushed down the guy's face. "N-no... I was too busy staring at the chick... I mean, the little girl!"

Kevin's face darkened. He remembered that tiny girl sitting on the sofa earlier. What kind of sicko could do that to someone so small?

He sneered coldly. "You knew she was just a little girl, and you still did it? On our turf, too. You're really tired of living,huh?"He stood up abruptly and walked straight over.

"Hand me something,"he said.

A bodyguard placed tweezers in his open palm. Two others yanked the guy's arm out, gagged him tight with a cloth strip, and exposed his right hand.

Kevin'slips curled into a cruel smile, and he brought the tweezers towards the guy's fingernail.

"Mmmphmmph!" the man screamed in muffled agony.

One by one, the nails came off, no hesitation.

The others watched in horror, shaking in their boots, but there was nowhere to run.

The cries echoed through the entire basement as bright red blood soaked into the stone floor beneath five mangled hands.

Tristan stood up, posture casual, and strolled over with his hands in his pockets. "Which one of you tore my wife's dress?"

The bald guy violently shook his head.

The other four immediately turned and pointed at him.

Baldy wanted to scream. He was innocent! That woman tore it herself so she could beat them senseless!How was that his fault?!

Eyes wide with panic, he whimpered.

Tristan stared at him like he was lower than dirt. "Let him talk."

The gag came off. "She tore it herself!" the bald guy sobbed. "Wrapped the fabric around her hands and used it to beat us!"

Kevin blinked, suddenly getting it. So the skirtwas in the way-Megan ripped it for convenience. Damn,she really was something. Took down five full-grown men like it was nothing. Tristan only snorted. "My wife's shy and soft-hearted. How could she possibly lay a finger on you? You terrified her."

Kevin:[These guys self-destructed,huh?]

All five:[That lady was a demon in heels. Are you blind??]

Tristan's jaw flexed tight; rage flickered in his eyes. He stretched out a hand. A white glove was placed in his palm.

Tristan slowly pulled it on, every move calm yet deadly, gaze fixed on the now-silent bald guy. His gummy grin returned, the kind that made your skin crawl. "Starting with you. NNo one walks away."

The bald guy's eyes blew wide as Tristan raised a bronze mallet-then slammed it down.

CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!

Each crushing blow landed on kneecaps until right legs all looked mangled beyond repair.

Tristan tossed the bloody hammer aside like trash.His voice was icy. "They saw what they shouldn't have.Don't deserve to keep their eyes."

He peeled off a pristine white glove and smacked it onto Kevin's chest. "Next time, don't forget your gloves."

With that, he turned and strode off.

Kevin threw the glove to the floor, visibly disgusted. He stared at the blood on his hands, his lips pursing slightly. Tristan's words echoed in his mind.

What exactly did they see?

Then it hit him-Megan's bright, bare legs.

A cold sweat broke out on his back. If he weren't Tristan's friend, would he have gotten his eyeballs dug out too?

Shaking off the shivers, he started to leave-only to circle back. He was seriously curious how that woman, Megan, took down all five guys.

Looking to one of the bodyguards, he said, "Take the cloth out of those two guys' mouths."

The bodyguard did as told.

Kevin narrowed his eyes at the two. "What move took you out?"

Tears streamed down their faces.

"Instant Egg Explosion."

"Sad Songs for the Eggs."

Kevin froze, his face a perfect mix of speechless and mildly horrifed.

Damn. She didn't hold back at all.



On the seventh floor, in the private guest suite.

Max had just finished checking over Chloe. He looked calmly at Megan. "She was drugged, but the dose was minor. She'll be fine after a good rest."

Max picked up his medical kit to leave, just as Tristan came in.

"How is she?"

Max pushed up the black-rimmed glasses on his nose and replied, "Just a sedative. Nothing serious. And hey,heard from Kai-you two have registered your marriage.? Congrats, man."

He gave Tristan a knowing smile, patted his shoulder, then walked off.

Tristan knew why he was smiling like that. To his buddies, Megan was queen of drama. A drama queen suddenly settling down and happily tying the knot? Gotta be some kind of new scheme.

But Tristan didn't care. Megan could throw fits, act up-he'd let her. Because honestly, isn't real love about her being a handful, and him just smiling through it?

When Megan saw Tristan coming, she flew into his arms, wrapping her arms tight around his waist.

"Honey, where did you go? | was so scared," she whispered.

Rachel: [Girl, were you not kicking ass five minutes ago?]

Kai:[Someone turned on their nonsense mode.]

Kevin:[Is this the same chick who just wrecked five full-sized dudes?]

Megan looked up at Tristan. "Tonight, I'll stay-"

She didn't even finish. Tristan's brows pulled tight, and he leaned in to whisper,"Tonight,you will only stay with me."

Rachel popped up like clockwork, "I'll stay and watch Chloe. You two just head back to Dreamscape Manor."

Tristan's dark eyes softened, a smile flickering at his lips.

His voice was velvet-deep. "The villa in Emerald Cove is all prepped. Tomorrow, you and Chloe can move in.Classes startin the morning-we'll pick you up."

End of discussion.He wrapped his arm around Megan and walked out.

Kai went back to his stoic, cold-guy aura. "I'm right next door. Shout if you need anything."

Then Tristan glanced at Kevin-and frowned.

Kevin was crouched beside the bed, staring at Chloe like a hungry dog eyeing a juicy steak.

"Kevin!" Kai snapped.

Kevin turned, clearly annoyed."What?"

Kai smirked. "Dude. You're drooling."

Kevin wiped his mouth quickly."NO,I'm not-hell no! You're messing with me!" He lunged at Kai, ready to fight back. But with a loud "thud," the drooling culprit face-planted on the floor.Total wipeout.

Rachel casually retracted her foot and shot him a look. "Dare to mess with my man."
###Chapter 24 I'm Ready


The window rolled down a crack, and a breeze tousled the man's dark, short hair-messy, yet crazy attractive.

One hand on the wheel, the other tightly laced with hers.

He was beating himself up for not going with her to the restroom.

When he realized she'd been gone for over ten minutes, panic hit him hard.

His first thought? She ran off again.

He pulled out his phone in a hurry to check Megan's location, only to remember she'd left without her phone.

He shot out of the room to find her, Kevin hot on his heels.

He stopped a couple of employees-Kai and Rachel-asking if they'd seen her, but nope, nothing.

Then a server rushed over, saying he saw a girl in a white dress head into a certain private room-and sounds of a scuffle came from inside.

He lost it and stormed into the room.

Seeing her safe and sound, his heart finally settled.

Every sharp word he'd planned to throw at her dissolved on his tongue. Right then, a crazy thought crossed his mind-

As long as she was okay, what if she did run?

He silently swore he'd never let her leave his sight again.

Dreamscape Manor. Standing at the entrance, Zeta Prime was waving its mechanical arms.

"Welcome back, Master and Goddess ! Zeta missed you two sooo much!"

Neither of them paid any attention to the dramatic bot and walked into the house.

"Environmental scan complete.

Emotional and physiological indicators: stable and elevated.

Atmospheric conditions: dark sky, optimal breeze-ideal parameters for human mating protocols.

Master is exhibiting high dominance.

Thermal signature:hot.

Energy levels: exceptional.

Conclusion:Master is...statistically irresistible."

Megan's mouth twitched hard. What the hell even was that?!

What kind of twisted nuts-and-bolts nonsense was that robot spouting?

Tristan paused mid-step, turned around with a slow, dark smile and said,

"Zeta Prime... you're done."

Zeta Prime instantly stopped cackling and-despite not having one-clenched its imaginary butt as it bolted.

Tristan scooped Megan up bridal-style and started up the stairs.

Her soft little hands clutched his shirt tight, nervous tension written all over her.

He pushed open the bedroom door, carried her in, nudged it shut with his foot.

The bed sunk in deep as they landed on the plush mattress.

Looking down at the flushed woman beneath himn, Tristan's Adam's apple bobbed. "You ripped your own dress, huh? That what happened?"

That teasing tone made her spine shiver.

She blinked her wide, innocent eyes and gave a tiny nod.

Flipping her over, Tristan ended up underneath her as she lay flat against his chest.

She gazed into his deep eyes, heat and want swirling inside. His breath skimmed her skin, warm and tempting.

She bit her lip,shy.

Then came a loud slap.

"Ahh!" she yelped in surprise. Her peachy behind just got smacked-real good.

"Ow." Looking at the pouty little woman sulking at him, Tristan's tone chilled.

"Still planning to wear skirts that short around other men?"

Megan puffed her colored cheeks in protest-it's not like she didn't have a reason! She turned her delicate face away with a faint "hmph."

Another slap. Megan's brows scrunched as she tried to wriggle away.

Slap-again.Then a few more.

Outside the door, Mrs. Jones had just raised her hand to knock and ask about breakfast when she stopped,lips curving in disbelief.

So many gasps, so many slaps, so many"Ow"s.

No need to guess-something wild was clearly going down in there.

Mrs. Jones sighed to herself: "Lord almighty, things escalated quick!"

Looks like it won't be too long till there's a new little Master or Miss around here.She stifled a laugh,tiptoeing out of the room.Meanwhile,inside was a totally different scene.

Megan sat up in bed abruptly, hands on her waist, frowning. "That seriously hurt, I'm mad now."

Tristan's lips curled into a smile as his warm palm wrapped around her slim waist.

"What are you giggling about?"

Megan looked down and instantly froze. Her fair, slender legs were spread, and she was straddling him.

That position...way too suggestive.

Face flushed, she bit her lip and muttered, "I'm never wearing short skirts again. Let me go."

Tristan flipped her onto her back, his slightly rough fingers trailing along her smooth thighs. "You can wear them-but only for me."

He dipped his head, sealing her lips in a kiss that was both punishment and desire.

But soon, it softened into something tender.

When he finally let her go, he glanced at her kiss-swollen lips and leaned in for another quick peck.

His voice was low and husky. "Babe, if things ever get dangerous, don't charge in by yourself. You've got me, I'm not just for display,got it?"

Megan's eyes shimmered from his kiss. She knew he wasn't just upset about her tearing her dress,but more because she hadn't asked him for help and put herself at risk.

She stared up at him, softly replying, "Got it."

He planted a kiss on her forehead and whispered, "Good girl. I'm gonna shower in the next room. You should wash up too."

"Okay," she said with a small nod.

Watching him leave, she suddenly jumped out of bed, pacing restlesslyon the carpet.

Just the thought of what was about to happen got her all giddy inside. She covered her mouth to kill the giggles.

But then she snapped back- wait, wasn't she supposed to check out that suspicious van?

Sure,Tristan had told Cameron to handle it on the way back.

But honestly, she didn't trust that goofball completely. Better to see for herself.

After glancing toward the door, she quickly sat at the desk and opened her laptop.

She jumped into the city's road surveillance system, pulled up all of that day's footage from the Capital,and saved everything to a folder.

But when the download finished, she noticed something weird- someone had hacked into the traffic bureau's network. All footage from that day had been wiped clean.

Her eyes narrowed.Someone was clearly trying to cover their tracks about the van.

Luckily, her reaction speed had been fast enough.

But tonight wasn't the time to dig further. Right now, she really needed a shower.

She dashed into the bathroom. The steady stream of warm water washed away all the chaos from earlier.

Soon after, she stepped out wearing a robe.

After a quick blow-dry of her dark curls, she walked into the closet.

She wanted something sexy for bed, but all the options were either too modest or had cheesy cartoon prints. Not the vibe.

She made a face, eventually settling on a sleeveless nightgown that at least showed off her smooth, pale arms.

She hopped back onto the bed, lying on her side with one hand supporting her head and the other fiddling with the hem of the gown.

Just then, the bedroom door clicked open and Tristan walked in wearing sleek black silkpajamas. His messy black hair and the fringe covering those deep, narrow eyes gave off serious heartthrob energy.

Seeing her lying there, effortlessly seductive without even trying, he couldn't help but smile.

He kicked off his slippers, crawled onto the bed beside her, and pulled her into his arms.

"You ready?"

Megan bit her lip shyly and nodded, "Yeah, I'm ready."

Ever since her rebirth, she never minded getting close to Tristan. She was willing to give herself to him-completely and wholeheartedly.
 ###Chapter 25 Impressive Size


A pink-hued room was basically made for romantic, flirty moments.

Megan shut her pretty eyes slowly, lips pursed into a soft pout.

Tristan, watching her look that cute, felt like his blood was about to boil over.

His Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed hard, heart pounding like crazy.

He tucked his face into the curve of her neck, breathing in her sweet, addictive scent.

Then he reached over to the nightstand, grabbed the remote, and clicked off all the lights.

The room went pitch black. Megan's eyes flew open in surprise.

A low, calm voice whispered near her ear, "Sleep. Just sleep."

Wait,what?

She literally threw herself at him and he wants to...sleep?

Megan stiffened. Was it her? Did she not have enough charm? Or. maybe he had a problem?

Tristan chuckled lowly, hugging her rigid body close. "Relax. You're still young. Let's wait until your twentieth birthday."

Megan rolled her eyes. "Seriously? What's even the difference between tonight and two months from now?"she thought.

Maybe he really did have issues...

"Stop overthinking. It's not about your charm. Trust me, I want to. But that day means something special."

His explanation made her take a deep breath. Of course, she'd been doubting his... ability. She huffed, muttering, "1 know I'm plenty attractive. Just look at these curves. Most guys would get a nosebleed."

Tristan tapped her lightly on the backside in mock warning, "If anyone else dares look, I'll gouge their eyes out."

Megan grinned mischievously. Her fingers poked at his firm chest. "Hubby."

That one soft word melted him from the inside out. The corner of his mouth curled as he gave an approving hum.

But the next line froze him on the spot.

"You sure you're not. you know.incapable?"

Of all the things to say to a man, that was probably top one most dangerous.

Without a word, Tristan pressed her down and bit her lower lip-not gently.

"Say that again.I dare you."

Moonlight slipped in through the crack in the curtains. Under the silver glow, Megan spotted desire burning in those deep, narrow eyes of his.

She gulped. "Alright, I get it. You're not just good-you're incredible. The best of the best."

Tristan's smile turned sly. He guided her hand along his toned body.

"Incapable or not... just feel for yourself."

Megan's breath hitched. Wait. was she holding that? Oh god-was that what she thought it was?

And it was already that hard? Holy hell. The size alone was... impressive.

Now she understood that ridiculous line from Zeta Prime way too well.

She inhaled sharply. If things really went down. her body would probably fall apart.

"Hey now, there's premium. and then there's you-top shelf,no contest."Her fingers twitched as she tried to pull away.

But Tristan leaned in, lips brushing her ear, his voice a low, dangerous murmur.

"You start the fire and now you want to play innocent?"

"l-I wasn't- I mean-"

He chuckled, slow and dark, the sound sliding down her spine.

"No backing out now, sweetheart. Changed the rules the moment you touched me."

Two hours later, the bathroom lights cast soft shadows over the pair standing at the sink.

Tristan held Megan's delicate hands under the running water, helping her clean them.

Her face was flushed pink, lips stubbornly pouted.

She mumbled under her breath, still sulky, "My hands are sore.So annoying."

Tristan kissed her steaming cheek, all playful. If your hand's sore already, how are you gonna survive later?"

Megan gave the man in the mirror a playful glare, then flicked the water on her hands right at his face.
Sticking out her tongue, she made a goofy face and darted out of the bathroom.

Tristan took a quick shower, changed into fresh pajamas, and headed back to bed.

Seeing the petite girl already asleep with her back to him, he reached out and pulled her into his arms."Good night,baby."



The next morning.

First day of school season.

After getting ready, Tristan kissed the sleepy girl in his arms.

"Don't mess around, still sleepy," Megan murmured, flopping over. "It's your first day back. We also have to pick up Rachel and Chloe."

At the mention of those names, Megan's eyes popped open instantly. She turned her head, eyes curved in a smile. "Morning,hubby."

Then she jumped out of bed and raced to the bathroom.

Once washed up, she rushed into the walk-in closet and picked out a white shirt, light denim jeans,and silver-gray flats.

Looking at the mirror, she felt fresh and neat. No doubt, her man would like this look.

From the shelf full of bags, she grabbed an LX limited-edition backpack.

She walked over to her desk and slipped her laptop into the bag.

By now, Tristan was already at the door in a crisp suit.

Seeing his modestly dressed girl walking over, he clicked his tongue and joked, "Even if you're bundled up in a down jacket, you'd still outshine everyone. What do I do? Kinda wanna hide you away."

Megan wrapped her arms around his neck and stood on tiptoe to give him a peck on those thin lips."Lemme check if you've been sneaking honey again."

Tristan chuckled. "Can you taste it?"

She shook her head. "Not sure. Better double-check."

He leaned down and kissed her again, sealing her mouth with his.

After a moment, he asked, "How about now?"

Gazing at his annoyingly handsome face, Megan grinned, "Sweet. Really sweet. Let's go, my little cupcake,time for breakfast."

Arm in arm, they headed downstairs to the dining room. Mrs. Jones greeted them with a warm smile.

She placed two bowls of Greek yogurt with berries and honey on the table, then quietly stepped away. No way she was gonna third-wheel.

Tristan watched Megan devour her breakfast like she hadn't eaten in days.

With a smirk, he teased, "Someone's got an appetite today. Wore you out last night, huh?"

Megan choked mid-bite and nearly sprayed yogurt across the table.

"Tristan!" she squeaked, cheeks turning crimson.

He burst out laughing and leaned over to wipe the corner of her mouth with a napkín.

She snatched it from his hand, glaring. "You are so inappropriate."

Tristan raised an eyebrow, amused. "You didn't seem to mind when I was being inappropriate last night."

Megan stood up with a huff. "You're impossible!"

He grabbed her by the waist, pulling her in close with a grin. "And yet, you still married me."

She swatted his chest, laughing despite herself. "You're the worst."

“Hahaha."

September 1st. First day of college.

Tristan drove Megan to school himself. They opted for a low-key Bentley and headed out.

They arrived at the Prestige Club.

Soon enough, Rachel and Chloe hopped into the car.

The moment she saw Megan, Chloe's eyes welled up, tears spilling down her cheeks.

That morning, Rachel had told her everything that happened the night before.

Besides feeling lucky to be alive, she was overwhelmed with gratitude toward Megan.

If Megan hadn't stepped in just in time, who knows what might've happened to her.
 ###Chapter 26 Older Guys and Cute Girls


Here's what went down.

Chloe was a senior at Honorbridge High, buried in the chaos of prep year. Last night, she had evening self-study at school, so the family's driver gave her a lft. She showed up ten minutes late, and by that time, the front gate was pretty much deserted.

Right after the car drove off and she started heading toward the gate, her phone rang. It was tucked in her backpack, so she stopped to fish it out. But when she answered, the caller didn't say a word and just hung up.

Before she could make sense of it, a van screeched to a stop beside her. The door flew open and someone grabbed her without warning. Within seconds, she was smothered with a cloth over her mouth and nose-after that, everything went black.

Tristan broke it down: "So the kidnapper clearly knew your routine. They knew you usually keep your phone in your backpack. Calling you served two purposes-stalling you and confirming your identity."

Chloe wiped her tears, fuming. "It wvas Molly for sure! That psycho wouldn't blink at doing something like this."

Megan handed her a pack of tissues. "Yeah, she's suspicious. But we've got to dig up some proof first."

Just then, Tristan's phone buzzed. He answered, and Cameron's voice came through.

"Tristan, I tried reaching you last night, but your phone was off."

Tristan's tone went ice cold."Talk."

"Someone wiped all traffic cam footage from the past three months. They're unrecoverable."

Tristan laughed-cold and sharp. "What are the engineers in tech even doing? If they can't fix this,maybe they all need to be replaced." He hung up abruptly.

Megan had caught the key points of the call. She wanted to tell him she already had the videos saved, but it wasn't time yet. She couldn't risk him knowing her real identity-especially since she'd once hacked international corporations... including his. That time, she swiped two hundred million from him.

She patted Tristan's arm lightly. "You alright?"

Tristan gave a soft chuckle. "I'm fine. It's just a small bump. I'Il handle it."

Rachel propped herchin in her hand. "Isn't Kevin's family in the comms tech business? You'd think he'd be good at hacking stuff too. Maybe he can lend a hand?"

Chloe looked interested. "Wait, Kevin? The infamous spoiled rich kid from Capitol City?"

Megan raised an eyebrow, curious too-this guy was the CEO of the leading communications tech firm in the country, backing national satellite programs. What was he really capable of?

Tristan gave a short laugh. "He's only good at one thing."

The three women said in unison, "What?"

"Being a goofball."

Chloe cracked up. "Oh my god, he's seriously the human form of a meme.What a character!"

Rachel smirked. "Come to think of it, lasț night I spotted that goofball sitting on the edge of the bed staring at you."

Chloe's laugh cut off instantly. "No way! That explains the nightmares-I dreamt some wide-eyed husky was staring at me all night!"

Megan glanced over at Tristan. "Honey, you think that husky's crushing on my sister?"

Tristan gave a dry cough. "Listen, Kevin's a bit of a loose cannon, but emotionally? He's a blank slate."

As best friend, he figured it was his duty to help his buddy out a little.But Chloe wasn't having it. She flipped her twin ponytails with a dramatic sigh."Ugh, no thanks. You don't have to cover for him, Tristan. He's already stamped as 'goofball' and 'spoiled rich kid' in my book. No way I'd ever date someone that goofy."

Tristan:[Sorry,man.Itried.]

Kevin:[ You're the one who labeled me a 'goofball' first!]

At that moment, our dear Mr. Goofball was lounging in the front passenger seat, rushing Kai, who was behind the wheel. "Come on, step on it! I need to see my girl off at school!"

Kai glanced at him sideways, unimpressed. "Did she even agree to be your girlfriend? Pretty sure that's just you living in your own fantasy."

Kevin flipped his fringe with flair. "C'mon, when I show up, girls practically faint at my feet."

Kai's lips twitched. "Kev, can you just... have some self-respect? You're twenty-six. That girl's eighteen.You're literally creeping into 'older guy' territory."

Kevin shrugged. "So what? You and Tristan got six years on your girls too. I'm just two years ahead of the curve. Haven't you heard the saying? 'Older guys and cute girls? Classic combo. Totally legit!'"

Kai:[Shameless much?]

Honorbridge High and Meridian University were separated by just one street.

A black Bentley rolled to a stop on the side of the road.

Rachel and Chloe hopped out of the carfirst.

Tristan gently kissed Megan's hand. "I'll come pick you up for lunch."

Knowing how packed Tristan's schedule was, Megan said, "It's fine, I'll eat with Rachel and Chloe. Just come grab me after class around 4:30."

Tristan gave a small nod. "If anything happens,call me."

"Got it." She gave him a quick peck on the cheek and stepped out.

The Bentley didn't drive off right away.

Megan knew Tristan wouldn't leave until he saw her walk into school safely.

She turned to Chloe. "Go on, have a good class. I'll wait for you at lunch."

Chloe nodded. "Okay, I'm heading in. See you later, Meg, Rachel."

Just as she swung her bag onto her shoulder and started to cross the road, a flamboyant figure popped up out of nowhere.

"Yo!Chloe-baby!"

Chloe was not having it. Her face changed as she bolted back toward Megan, yelling,"Sis! Creep alert!"

Kevin froze mid-step. "Wait, how did I end up being the creep?!"

Kai gave her a thumbs-up. "Good instincts!"

Walking up to Megan and Rachel, Kevin glanced at the girl hiding behind her sister. "Hey uh, I'm Kevin Ward.Totally harmless. Definitely not a stalker."

Chloe peeked out, eyeing him. "You're... that goofball guy?"

"Hluh?" Kevin looked completely confused.

Megan and Rachel burst out laughing.

Kevin glanced at the Bentley and frowned. Yeah, Tristan probably didn't paint himm in the best light.

Megan motioned Chloe closer. "It's fine, just call him Goofball Bro."

Chloe gave a tiny nod. "Hi, Goofball Bro."

Kevin twitched at the nickname, but hey-at least she called him Bro.

He brushed his fringe with exaggerated elegance. "Come on, your Goofball Bro will escort you to class." Kevin looked at Megan and said, "Relax, Meg-your sis is basically my sis. I'll make sure she's super safe."

He took Chloe's bag and slung it over his own shoulder."Let's go. Don't wanna be late."

Chloe gave a small nod and followed him.

Rachel sent a passionate look Kai's way. "Guess I'm off with Meg."

Kai didn't flinch. Just let out a non-committal "Mm."

With that, Megan and Rachel turned and walked off.

Once the two figures disappeared into the school gates, the black Bentley merged back into traffic.

Kai only got back into the car after confirming they were out of sight.

 ###Chapter 27 Don't Bark If You Can't Bite


The main gate of Meridian University was still a ways off from the main building, and a leafy path stretched out between.

With fifteen minutes left before class, Megan and Rachel took their time, strolling slowly under the dappled sunlight.
"Hey, Meg," Rachel leaned in with a grin,三didn't get the chance yesterday-what made you switch gears all of a sudden?"

Megan offered a soft smile. "I had this dream. in it, Tristan died for me. It felt too real to ignore.When I woke up, I started thinking back to everything he's done. He wasn't trying to control me, he just. cared too much.I realized I misjudged him. I'm ready now-to understand him, to accept him. and to love him."

Rachel blinked, dumbfounded. "You're telling me a dream flipped the switch? That's wild. Maybe if the Lee family all dreamed I saved their lives, they'd finally treat me better."

Megan gave her shoulder a gentle pat. "Relationships are about two people. But marriage in families like ours? It's all politics. Sure, getting their blessing is nice, but don't let it weigh you down too much. In families like this, love's usually the first casualty. Don't sweat the Lee family. They don't matter. Someday, when Kai's got his footing, no matter who you are, they'll have to respect you."

Rachel nodded, a bit more at ease now.She suddenly looped her arm through Megan's, leaned close,and whispered wickedly, "So. last night?"

Megan flicked her right on the forehead. "Get your head out of the gutter. It's all polatonic right now.."

Rachel hissed in fake pain, rubbing her forehead while mumbling, "UJgh, don't tell me my brother's.incapable?"

Megan shot her an eye-roll. Not like she could admnit her arm was still sore.

As they reached the steps of the main building, three girls abruptly blocked their path. "Oh wow, look who it is-Miss Dumped-by-Reid herself," sneered Lillian.

"Didn't you go on leave or something? Got the nerve toshow up to class again?" added Jeanie.

"Seriously, if it were me, I'd be too embarrassed to show my face," chimed Erin.

Megan turned to Rachel. "Do you hear barking?"

Rachel fanned the air in front of her nose. "Not just rabid barking. but it reeks. Like something crawled in their mouths and died."

Megan clicked her tongue in mock sympathy. "Guess it's true-old habits die hard."

Lillian shot her a finger. "You bitch! Who are you calling that?"

"Whoever's been snacking on crap, obviously," Megan's smile was ice-cold.

She and Rachel made to walk past the trio, brushing off the taunts. But Lillian wasn't done-she lunged forward, fingers aimed at Megan's black hair.

Big mistake. Megan's leg shot out and nailed her square in the face.

With a shriek, Lillian toppled back onto the ground, a dark shoe print smacked right across her pale cheek.She shot a glance at Jeanie and Erin. "Useless. Get over here!"

The two exchanged uneasy looks-none of them dared to move, terrified they'd be the next to get a shoeprint slapped on their face.

Megan let out a mocking scoff. "Calling you dogs would be an insult to actual dogs. I don't even know who you are, so stop trying so hard to get attention."

Lillian felt completely disregarded. No matter what, she and Megan had at least been classmates. Saying she didn't know her? That was a slap in the face, screaming she was a forgettable nobody. That stung worse than an actual hit.

"You act like you're above everyone!" she snapped. "Think you're all that now, huh? Pretending you don't know anyone?" Megan tilted her head and stared at her coolly. "Ever heard of garbage sorting? I'm human; you're trash. No reason for me to know what bin you belong in."

With that, she nonchalantly walked off into the teaching building, Rachel by her side.

As the two entered Room 413, the lively chatter instantly died. All eyes landed on Megan.

In the center of the classroom sat Molly. Her eyes were clear and innocent, and she looked up at Megan with a seemingly harmless smile.

Only the back row had open seats. Megan and Rachel walked up the steps toward the last row.

Right behind them, Lillian and her crew strutted in.

Then a few snide female voices piped up:

"Some people get dumped and somehow the whole country hears about it. Embarrassing much? And she still has the nerve to show up here?"

"Heard she clawed her way into some old guy's bed.Sounds about right."

"Totally shameless,honestly."

Among the whispers, a few disgusting male voices joined in:

"Can't believe l used to think she looked pure. Turns out she's just trash."

"Yeah, if I'd known she was such easy pickings, I'd have made a move too. Who knows how many times she's been passed around."

"Well, if she's that cheap, she's just a toy now."

"Not scared of getting AIDS? Damn, got some real twisted tastes."

"But hey, if it's free, why not?"

"Exactly,lol..."

 Rachel's fists clenched tight-she was just about ready to beat some sense into them. It was clear they were spewing filth just to smear Megan's name.

Lillian, still clutching her slapped cheek, let out a low laugh. This show was too satisfying to miss.

She strutted past Megan with a sneer. "Different people, different views. But your dirty laundry's out for everyone to see!"

Megan had already mentally marked the gossiping trash talkers.

Without a word, she took off her backpack and handed it to Rachel. "Hold this."

Then she calmly stepped down two levels and pointed at three sleazy-looking guys. "You. You. And you.Out."


The guys stared at Megan's gorgeous face, their expressions turning lewd.

One of them smirked and shot back, "Wat, this gonna be a live show or something?"Megan curved her lips into a subtle smile and tapped on the desk of the guy with thick glasses. "You. Open the alumni site and start a livestream."

The guy looked nervous and tried to reason with her. "Megan, don't do this to yourself. Let them say whatever they want. Don't bother with it so much."

Three boys snapped at him, "You wanna die, four-eyes?!"

"She's chill about it and you're still whining?"

"Exactly! Keep yapping and I'll knock your teeth out!"

The guy stubbornly averted his gaze, like even if they beat him half-dead, he still wouldn't cave to this kind of shady stuff.

Then,out of nowhere, one of the guys-bleached blond with a cocky swagger-swung his fist straight at the glasses boy's head.

"Ahh!" A loud scream echoed across the huge classroom.

But it wasn't the glasses boy who cried out-it was the blond guy. Megan had punched him right in the wrist.

His whole arm started trembling like crazy. "Damn it! Get her!"

The guy with glasses stared in disbelief, adjusting his frames like he couldn't make sense of what was happening.

Megan's voice was like ice. "Start the livestream."

He fumbled to open the app, hurried to a good spot, and began filming.

He steadied the camera just in time to watch Megan grab another guy by the collar and jab her fingers into his eyes with deadly precision.

Then, with a swift spin, she kicked another dude straight in the side of the head.

As for the bleached blond, he didn't dare take another step forward.

Megan let out a cold laugh, lunged forward, and socked him square in the face. He dropped like a sack of bricks, nose bleeding all over the floor.

Nobody could believe this serene-looking girl with soft black waves and fairy-like features had just won a full-on classroom brawl.

She stepped hard on bleached blond's şhirt, her tone icy. "Next time you wanna talk trash, I'll ship you to the landfill myself. They've got shredders."

Her sharp gaze swept toward the three girls near the window-the same ones who'd been stirring up drama earlier.

Megan lifted her chin a notch. "Need me to do it, or you gonna handle yourselves?"

The girls were completely frozen, gulping hard, heads shaking like bobbleheads.

Megan held up her fingers, making a scissor gesture. "Slap yourselves. Or I'Il save you the trouble." Grimacing, they gave themselves a couple weak slaps.

"Is that all you've got?" Megan's voice cut through like a knife.

Then came the loud "smack, smack" echoing through the room as the girls really started hitting themselves.

Tears streamed down their faces. "Is... is that enough?"

Megan crossed her arms, eyes like frosted glass, her words sharp as frostbite. "Twenty each. Don't cheat."

The three of them sobbed while slapping themselves, trying to drag it out long enough for the teacher to show up and save them from the humiliation.

That's when the sharp click of high heels echoed from the corridor.
###Chapter 28 Oops, I'm the No-Mercy Type


The sharp "clack-clack-clack" of high heels echoed down the hallway.

The three boys and three girls instantly perked up like they'd just seen their savior. As soon as the femnale teacher walked in, they burst out crying, "Teacher, help us!"

Seeing the three guys slumped on the floor and the three girls fiercely slapping themselves, the teacher's brows knitted tightly. "What's going on here? Bullying?"

Molly immediately stood up, acting like a model student. "Teacher, there's just been a misunderstanding.My sister didn't hit them on purpose."

Really? Could she sound any more suspicious?

It sounded like she was defending Megan, but what she actually did was outright say Megan hit someone.

Megan casually lifted her foot off the chest of the bleached-blond guy and shrugged. "Yeah, this is bullying alright."

The teacher strode to the podium, slamming her teaching material down.

She glared right at Megan. "You're Megan Shaw, right? The one who was on leave for half a year? First day back and already starting fights?"

Megan let out a cold chuckle and settled into the seat where the glasses guy had been before."|said bullying, but I meant I was the one being bullied."

"Then how come they're al on the ground and their faces are so bruised?"

"They slapped themselves. As for those lying there-well, guess they couldn't handle it." Megan smirked."Since when does being bullied mean you have to end up totally defeated?"

She went on, "They were the ones who insulted me and made the first move. I just taught them a little lesson. Tell me, Miss-am I not allowed to fight back? And also-what's wrong with taking a break from 
school? And also-what gives you the right to say I bullied anyone?"

With those three back-to-back questions, the teacher was completely stumped.

Megan then pointed at the security camera above the podium. "If you really want to know what happened between the time I walked in and you arrived, just pull up the footage."

The teacher took in a sharp breath. Ugh, first class of the new term and it's already such a headache.

She turned to the bruised girls and the boys helping each other up. "You all go see the nurse first. If it's serious, head to the hospital. As for the medical costs..."

She looked to Megan. "Megan, you can't just walk away from this."

Just as those six were about to leave, Megan said lightly, "Think you've slapped yourselves enough yet?"

The three girls instantly burst into pitiful sobs.

The teacher sighed deeply. "Megan, sometimes it's better to let things go. Give others and yourself some space."

Megan tapped her finger lightly on the desk.ops, my bad. I've always been the no-retreat, no-mercy type.Especially..."

She turned to glance at Molly, her gaze sharp. "Especially toward people with nasty intentions."

Then she looked back at the three girls, her voice cold as ice. "Do it."

The classroom went dead silent. Only the loud, crisp slaps echoed in the room.

Megan casually clapped along with the rhythm in midair, almost like she was enjoying a beautiful symphony.

Once the noise died down, she pulled out her phone and made a call.

Her tone was soft and aggrieved. "Honey/, I got bullied at school. Can you send Linus Blake over?"

She continued, "Mhm, okay. Love you too. Muah."

Everyone sucked in a breath. She'd just beaten them to a pulp and still had the nerve to act all pitiful and call in a lawyer?

Wait-Linus Blake? Isn't he, like, the top lawyer in the country?

Hold on-who the hell is her husband?

At that moment, Principal Scott pushed the door open. He froze for a second at the scene before him, then frowned deeply.

1n a serious voice, he asked, "What's going on? I just saw a livestream on the alumni site."

The three boys and three girls instantly started crying and complaining, talking about being beaten-of course skipping the part where they started it.

The guy with glasses adjusted them calmly. "Principal Scott, they insulted Megan first and threw the first punch. They just got beat because they picked the wrong target. As for the girls, that was all self-inflicted.You can check the surveillance footage."

A girl whimpered, "Principal Scott, it was Megan who told me to slap myself!"

Megan tilted her head, smiling slightly. "Then if I tell you to eat sh*t, you gonna doit too?"

Principal Scott turned to Megan with an almost too-friendly smile. "Miss Shaw, you're not hurt, are you?"

Everyone: [Principal Scott, are you blind?]

Principal Scott straightened up, serious again. "I'll make sure this whole incident is investigated thoroughly.No favoritism, no cover-ups. And nowN, or behalf of Meridian University,like to thank Miss Megan Shaw."

Megan raised an eyebrow. What, they gonna give her a medal for slapping jerks?

Everyone else was just as stunned.

"Miss Shaw has personally donated a library to our university-a facility with a floor area of 300,000 square meters. She also arranged for the import of advanced research equipment from abroad, including many developed by Professor XAL himself."

The moment he finished speaking, the girls who had been sobbing just now instantly shut up. The whole classroom was dead quiet-you could hear a pin drop.

Megan knew all of this came from Tristan. The man really knew how to make a statement for her.

A 300,000-square-meter library? That's massive. The biggest one in the country so far was only 280,000.This wasn't just about money anymore-it had escalated to a matter of reputation.

And that instrument developed by Professor XAL? Practically impossible to get your hands on a single one,let alone a whole batch.

Now those six-three guys and three girls-finally realized they'd messed with the wrong person. Regret was probably eating them alive.

Just imagine getting beat up and then being sued on top of that-by one of the top lawyers out there, no less. They looked like they'd rather crawl into a hole and never come out. If this ended up dragging their families down too, they'd be done for.

All six of them were pale and miserable-no trace of their earlier bravado left.

"As for the medical bills?" Megan glanced at the three guys with a smirk. "Self-defense. I'm not paying a dime."

Then she turned to the three girls, tone cool."And you three did it to yourselves. Nothing to do with me.Once my lawyer gets here, you'll be hearing from him-defamation and slander, both."

She smiled slightly at Principal Scott. "Principal, would you mind taking them to your office? My lawyer will meét them there. Also, I'd appreciate it if you could pull up the classroom surveillance footage."

Principal Scott nodded quickly. "Of course. No problem at all."

He shot a stiff glance at the teacher and said sternly, "Continue with the lesson."

Then he turned to lead the six students out.

"Principal Scott, hold on a second."

Megan raised a finger, pointing at the three girls sitting in the back row-Lillian and her friends. They looked 
like they wanted to disappear into their seats, not daring to even lift their heads.

"Don't forget those three. If the hallway cams are working, they'll show exactly what happened ten minutes ago. And even if they're broken, I'm pretty sure more than a few students saw what went down. Someone's bound to speak up."

Principal Scott's face darkened. These kids were really pushing their luck.

Out of all the people they could've picked on, they had to mess with Tristan's wife?

He snapped, clearly annoyed, "What are you waiting for? Move it!"

Lillian and her friends looked like frightened puppies, heads down, trailing after him out of the classroom without ever daring to look Megan in the eye.

Megan turned to the teacher and gave a polite smile. "Next time, maybe double-check the facts before speaking.Thanks."

With that, she strolled down the aisle and took her seat in the back row.

The teacher, visibly uneasy, resumed the lesson-clearly shaken by how badly she'd misread the situation.

By the time the bell rang, she bolted outlike something scary was chasing her.

The students didn't waste time either. Everyone rushed out the door like their lives depended on it-no one wanted to risk upsetting Megan, not even by accident.
 ###Chapter 29 She Hits Online and Offline


The fight video exploded online in no time. Public opinion was overwhelmingly on Megan's side. After all,school bullying hit a nerve-too many people had been there. So when the bully got a taste of their own medicine, it was honestly satisfying.

Megan instantly became a hero at Meridian University.

Inside the CEO's office on the 88th floor of Reid Corporation, Tristan sat behind his redwood desk, watching the clip of the fierce little woman, a rare smirk lifting the corners of his mouth. But his expression quickly cooled as he grabbed his phone and dialed Linus Blake.

"Give them the harshest punishment possible."

Hanging up, he pressed the intercom. "Come in."

Within five seconds, Cameron stepped up to his desk. Tristan sat back in his leather chair,fingers rhythmically tapping the table.

"Look into the background of all nine of them. If there's any business with their families, cut off everything-and I mean everything.Put pressure on them from all sides."

Then he added flatly, "Until they go bankrupt."

"Yes, sir." Cameron nodded respectfully and walked out.

Tristan swiped open a photo of Megan saved on his phone, gently brushing over her delicate face with his finger.He couldn't help but wonder what his girl was doing right then.

A glance at his watch-

Probably still in class.

His eyes narrowed as he set his fingers on the keyboard, entering a heavily encrypted website. A private section of the dark web. He clicked on"God of Hackers" and sent a message: "I need yesterday's surveillance footage of Capitol City, and info on the guy who hacked the traffic bureau.Five million."

Two seconds later, a reply: "Ten million."

Tristan arched an eyebrow. Someone's feeling greedy lately. He typed back:"Deal."

At the same time, a new secure email popped into his inbox. After double-checking that it was safe, he opened it. There it was-Capitol City's footage from the day before.

Sender:ShadowWing.

He hesitated.

The same ShadowWing who once hijacked two hundred million from his company. But when he saw the note attached, he didn't think twice about downloading it.

It said: "If I wanted to hack you, I wouldn't need to ask. This link self-destructs in five minutes-don't thank me."

Then a location: "The trash hacker from yesterday's traffic bureau stunt."

A free gift. No reason to pass it up. Not that he planned on saying thank you.

As soon as the download finished, the email wiped itself automatically. Leaning on one elbow, Tristan ran a thumb along his jawline, thoughtful.
。
ShadowWing-world-class hacker-had vanished for half a year. Equally famous as God of Hackers.Practically a legend.

Back when Reid Corp got hit, he'd hired God of Hackers to track down the culprit. The guy had made big promises. And ended up being played like a rookie. From then on, it was all-out war between the two hackers.Every time God of Hackers got a job, ShadowWing swooped in to beat him to it.

Tristan chuckled and shot one more message to God of Hackers: "Cancel the order. ShadowWing's back.They sent me the vid and hacker's whereabouts for free." The reply never came. The profile icon dimmed and went offline.

Somewhere in a dark room, sharp eyes locked onto a glowing screen. A man smirked dangerously.

"ShadowWing. you finally showed yourself. I won't let you slip away this time."

Meanwhile, hiding out in the girls' bathroom, Megan sneezed out of nowhere. She rubbed her nose. "Who's talking about me now."

Flipping her laptop shut, she'd already traced the van. But it was a stolen vehicle.

The driver ditched it in an alley and had disappeared, making things a hell of a lot tougher.Since she was living at Dreamscape Manor and spending her nights with Tristan, she hardly had time to poke into this mess. So she simply sent the video to Tristan. With his influence, finding that guy would be a piece of cake.

She'd also dug up the hacker who broke into the traffic bureau last night-talk about showing off in front of a pro. Didn't know when to quit. She forwarded all of it to Tristan and let him handle the follow-up. With a smirk tugging at her lips, she slung her backpack over one shoulder and walked out of the restroom.

It was 11:30 in the afternoon, second class just let out. Megan and Rachel were planning to grab lunch with Chloe at Emerald Cove. But then-bam, Chloe called and said she had plans with Goofball Bro at noon.

For a split second, Megan felt like her precious little cabbage had just been snatched by-no, not a pig-a dumb puppy

Whatever. To be friends with Tristan, the guy's character probably wasn't too awful.
0
As the two of them walked toward Emerald Cove, they ran into Molly and a couple of her friends at the crosswalk.

Molly approached them with a bright smile. "Megan."

Megan gave that fake face one glance too many-she didn't even bother to look now.

Molly immediately put on the pitiful act. "Didn't think you're still mad at me.I'm not what you think l am."

That helpless-face routine again, trying to paint Megan as the cold and arrogant one. Her two friends tugged at her sleeve and whispered, "Let it go, Molly. She's got connections now, don't bother."

Rachel didn't know the whole history between the Shaw sisters, but after witnessing Megan stand up for Chloe last night without hesitation, one thing was clear-Megan cared deeply about friends. Which made Molly the classic two-faced type in Rachel's eyes-the kind that plays weak while scheming in the dark.

Rachel hated those manipulative girls with a passion. She took a step forward, chin raised, tone cold."Cut the innocent act. You know exactly what you did."

Molly's expression didn't change, but inside she jolted. Could they have figured out she was behind last night's drama? No way. If Megan had hard proof, she wouldn't be standing here chatting. Besides, she'd already wiped those surveillance videos clean. Paid good money for that-one million bucks for airtight erasure. Even if Hacker God and Blackwing teamed up, they couldn't recover a thing. And that driver?Totally pro. Even if caught, he wouldn't spill-his daughter was still in her hands, after all.

Feeling pretty smug, Molly was just trying to figure out who this girl daring to boss her around even was.She blinked, tears welling up in seconds. Two drops slipped down her face. "Even your friend thinks I'm the bad guy now?"

Translation:[Megan,how could you? Look at how you're dragging my name through the mud.]

Rachel frowned,about to snap back when she felt a soft tap on her shoulder.

Megan smiled, easy and bright. "Whether it's a misunderstanding or not, we both know the truth. No need to put on this performance."

She pulled a tissue from her bag and gently dabbed at Molly's tears, her lips curled with a hint of mockery."Only a fool believes crocodile tears."

Looking at the damp tissue in her hand, she gave it a squeeze-then stuffed it right up Molly's nose.

She patted Molly's stunned face, eyes wide like a deer in headlights. "Shoving a tissue up a pig's nose doesn't make it classy. Try harder next time."

Rachel couldn't help herself-the scene was just too ridiculous-and burst into laughter.
Molly, furious, flared her nostrils so hard the tissue shot right out.The scene looked like a shaken soda bottle, about to pop its cap from all the pressure inside.
###Chapter 30 Why Did She Lie To Me


Seeing that furious yet barely-contained expression, Megan raised a playful brow and teased, "No matter what you stuff up a pig's nose, it's still a pig!"

With that, she turned around, grabbed Rachel's hand, and happily skipped across the street.

Watching their bright and carefree backs walk away, Molly's red lips trembled with rage. That damn woman really humiliated her right in public. She swore, today's embarrassment, she'd pay it back-tenfold, no, a hundredfold!

Her two friends quickly stepped up to console her.

"Molly, are you okay? Megan totally overstepped. Doesn't she get that you're still her sister?"

"Exactly! But seriously, any idea who her sugar daddy is? Could it be Mr. Reid?"

"No way. Didn't she run from the wedding? Why would Mr. Reid take her back after that?"

"True, no man would let that slide. Still, Molly, do you know who she's with now?"

Molly's chest heaved with fury, and she almost shattered one of her perfect porcelain veneers from clenching so hard. With a deep breath, she lowered her gaze and replied, "I really don't know. I haven't seen her for about six months now. Last time I bumped into her, she was throwing up non-stop. Then she came back home a few days ago, shot me dirty looks for no reason. I had no clue what I did to piss her off.She and Dad went into the study and chatted for a while, and not long after, I was told to leave the room."

She sniffled as she finished speaking. The two friends bought her lie completely, outrage bubbling up in their voices.

"No way! She's been living off some old guy for six months? And puking? Is she pregnant?!"

"Ugh, she's got no shame at all."

"She's even trying to mess with your relationship with your family. That woman's just evil." "Can't believe she's headed to that fancy villa in Emerald Cove, while you're stuck in a two-bedroom flat."

"Yeah, that's just messed up."

.-.

As the two kept rambling on in outrage, a glint of calculation flashed across Molly's eyes.

Since Megan didn't plan on revealing her marriage to Tristan, she'd just pretend not to know either and let people keep thinking Megan snagged some sugar daddy, preferably an old one.

Even if the truth came out someday, that Megan was actually married to Tristan, so what? Women only feel envy and hate, not admiration. Once Saturday rolled around, just wait-these two wouldn't last.

She grabbed both of her friends' hands and pressed her lips together. "No matter what, she's still my sister."

One of the girls wiped away her tears. "Molly, you're seriously too kind."

하

When Megan and Rachel got back to the Emerald Cove, Penelope had already laid out a feast.

She clearly liked Megan a lot, piling food into her bowl like a doting mother-in-law."Megan, you're way too thin. Eat more, it's good for getting pregnant."

Megan nearly choked. This wasn't dinner-it was an ambush.

Rachel passed her a tissue and looked over at Penelope.om, she's not even twenty yet and still in school.If she gets pregnant now, she'd have to drop out, right?"

Penelope let out a loud laugh. "Fair enough. I was just getting a bit anxious, since your brother's already twenty-six. But Megan, no pressure, okay? I won't bug you about it."

The rest of the meal, Megan ate like she was walking on a tightrope.After lunch, she said to Rachel, "Rachel,I'm heading out to grab a few personal items. You can go straight to class later."

Rachel's eyes lit up, mischief all over her face. "Personal items? What is it? Maid outfit? Cosplay? Whips and cuffs? Megan, you're kinda wild!"

Megan's mouth twitched. This girl's brain was clearly overrun with R-rated content. "Since you know so much,maybe I'll get your brother to forward those suggestions to Kai."

Rachel wasn't fazed. "I'd totally wear them-too bad Kai won't give me the chance!"

Megan was speechless. Okay, her logic really was...refreshing.

She said goodbye to Penelope and left the Emerald Cove. Just as she got into a cab, her phone rang. It was Tristan.

"Had dinner yet?"

"Yeah,ate at the villa.You?"

"I just finished too. I thought I heard a car just now-did you head out?"

Hlis tone hinted at worry, and Megan leaned into it coyly, "Just took a cab to pick up some... girl stuff. You know the kind."

Hearing that, his voice relaxed a bit."Alright, just be careful. You can drive yourself tomorrow, so you don't have to rely on cabs."

"Okay." Thinking about the morning, Megan felt a warmth in her chest. "Hubby, thank you... for everything."

Tristan's lips curled slightly."My woman,doesn't deserve to be wronged. And one more thing-l got an email from Blackwing this morning. It was footage from yesterday's road cam. I've had my team look into it, but the car's reportedly stolen. Don't worry though-we'll track down whoever's behind this in the next couple of days."

Megan had no doubt about his capability. If Tristan said he'd handle it, he would. They exchanged a few more sweet nothings before hanging up.

The taxi driver glanced at the rearview mirror, shaking his head. Ghosts might be real these days, but trusting a pretty girl's word? That's just naïve.

The place she askedd to go was legit on the surface-but at street level. Underground, it was a black market.People didn't come here to shop for toiletries.

When they reached the spot, Megan handed over the fare. The driver gave her a look and said kindly, "This area's kinda sketchy, miss. Keep your guard up,alright?"

She smiled. "Got it,sir."

As she opened the door to step out, the driver rolled the window down again.

"Little lady, don't lie to those who truly care about you. It hurts. A lie's never just one-it always leads to more."

Megan paused,thoughtful, then nodded and walked away.

Meanwhile, Tristan had his eyes locked on the map on his screen, watching a red dot move across it. His expression turned dark, and a chill crept into his eyes.

She really did go to the black market. She actually lied to him.

If he hadn't secretly installed a tiny one-millimeter tracker deep inside her phone the other night when she wasn't looking, she would've had him completely in the dark.

But what was she doing there?

Tristan exhaled slowly, tamping down the irritation simmering in his chest. He leaned back in his chair,fingers tapping rhythmically against the armrest-slender, steady, deceptively calm.

His gaze dropped to the ring on his finger.

If you love her, you trust her. As long as she's not running away anymore... that's enough.
 ###Chapter 31 You're Just the Adopted Daughter

The black market was tucked underground, once a bomb shelter, now turned into a bustling hidden marketplace. Because the people pulling strings behind those shops were all shady figures, this place was pretty much a no-man's-land.

No one's brave enough to mess with it-not the law, not the gangs, not even the curious.

Megan tied up her hair, slipped on a mask and threw on a baseball cap she'd"borrowed" from Rachel.She walked into a self-service adult toy shop like it was her backyard.

Behind a hidden door inside, a staircase led her down. Most stores had their doors shut, but it was clear they were open for business.

She headed straight to the section for advanced gear and stepped into a familiar shop she used to visit often.


The owner was a young guy, busy gaming at his desk. As the footsteps approached, he glanced over and stood up.

"What're you looking for?"

He didn't recognize her since she always disguised herself as a guy when visiting before.

"Two units of the latest trackers and bugs, ten mini spy cams, and three high-voltage stun devices."

Her tone was sharp and to the point.

The owner raised his eyebrows, impressed, then got to work gathering everything. Soon after, he showed her a compact cutting-edge gadget.
"This one's a prototype from Dracopower Communications, not even released yet. It's got tracking and eavesdropping rolled into one. Supposedly designed by Professor XAL. Just stick it under the chip board,it'll pick up sound from there." That caught Megan's attention. She pulled out a pair of white gloves, put them on, and picked up the devi with a pair of tweezers he handed her.

It was sleek-barely two millimeters. But unreleased? From Professor XAL?

It made sense-Dracopower did partner with that professor-but if this kind of classified tech was leaking out,something was definitely off at Dracopower.

Normally, she'd give Kevin a heads-up, given he was buddies with Tristan. But in her current situation,exposing herself wasn't worth it.Maybe later, if an opportunity popped up.

"I'H take this combo model instead."

"20K each."

"Sure.Sounds fair."

The owner beamed at her response, clearly thrilled to be dealing with someone who didn't haggle or waste time.He packed the gear neatly in a box and pushed it acrossthe counter.

"That'll be 50,900 total."

Megan didn't say another word. She wire transferred the money fast, grabbed the box, and slipped the covered tweezers into her pocket before heading out.

After confirming the payment, the owner got curious and checked her encrypted sender ID.

Butit came up as inaccessible. A momerrt later, the screen went black.

Blood-red text appeared: "Curiosity killed the cat."

He was frozen for a second-this was exactly how that mysterious regular customer used to operate. Wait a sec.Could this woman be that guy's girlfriend?

Megan then swung by the pharmaceutical booths and bought knockout sedatives, syringes, and a nurse's outfit.

On her way back, she paused once more inside the adult store. Her ears turned red as she stared at row after row of ultra-thin lingerie and seductive outfits.

She bit her lip, glanced around the empty shop, and quickly snatched up five sets, had them packed up, and paid without fuss.

Inside the venue, Rachel was waving like a maniac from the back row, acting like she hadn't seen Megan in years.

Megan walked over and sat down next to her.

"Hey Megan! Aren't you proud of me? If I hadn't shown up early, all the good seats at the back would've been taken!"

Megan felt speechless.

Rachel leaned in with a cheeky grin.

"Tell me-did you score something...spicy?"

Of course, Megan knew exactly what she meant.She shot Rachel a sideways glance. "Seriously? You've got a runaway train running loops in your head now."

"Huh? What do you mean?"

"You've got a dirty mind, that's what,"

Megan pulled a stun gun out of her bag and handed it over. "Here. A gift. In case some creep tries something."d

Rachel's face lit up and she quickly shoved it into her bag. "You're the best, Megan!"

The lecture was on clothing construction and garment design. Rachel, with her background in jewelry design from France, knew a thing or two about fashion. She was laser-focused. Megan, though? Totally checked out. She rested her chin in her hands like flower petals, deep in thought. Then a sly little smirk crept up her lips.

One glance at her phone-five minutes left.She leaned into Rachel and whispered something.

Rachel's eyes lit up mischievously and she raised an eyebrow at Megan.

The bell rang.

Rachel shot up and made her way to the front of the room.

Stopping at Molly's desk, she knocked on the table. "Hey, I heard you've been bad-mouthing Megan behind her back?"

Molly blinked innocently. "I haven't. There must be some mistake."

Rachel smacked the desk hard, voice rising. "So you talk trash then pretend it wasn't you? Really? And don't think I didn't hear about your little fling with Mr. Carden from Everpeak Logistics."

Molly burst into tears. "Who are you even? I don't know you-what are you talking about..."

Where the hell did this woman come from? And how did she find out about Carden?

By now, a crowd had gathered.

Molly stood up, grabbing her phone and bag, ready to bolt.

But Rachel caught her by the arm. "Oh no, you don't! Stay right there! That Mr. Cardenis my friend's dad!You're so young, yet already getting involved in this kindof mess..."

Megan brushed past them at that exact moment.

A split second later, there was a phone in her gloved hand. She walked straight into the ladies' room.

Inside a stall, Megan cracked the phone open and neatly placed a new high-tech tracker under the speaker module.

Then reassembled it without a trace. Back in the room, she effortlessly laid the phone on Molly's desk.

Pretending to break up the fight, she stepped in. "Okay, Rachel, chill. The truth has a way of coming out."

A chubby girl standing next to Molly glared at Megan. "Megan, seriously? Molly's your sister. Same parents
and all. Why are you so cruel? I'm not scared of you, unlike some people here."

"I'm telling it how it is. You let some sugar daddy keep you, got knocked up, then had an abortion. When you came back, you even kicked your sister out of the house. How messed up is that?"

Gasps echoed all around.

What? Megan was a kept woman? Had a baby and aborted it?

So the library donatons and everything-that was all paid for by this rich old boyfriend?

The buzz spread like wildfire.

Megan crossed her arms with a wry smile. "Molly, how much longer are you planning to pretend to be the real Miss Shaw? You've got the last name, sure. But blood ties? None. Come on now, why don't you tell everyone the truth? That you're just the adopted daughter of the Shaw family."

Megan continued, "Oh-and if I'm supposedly kept by someone, why not name him? Who is he? People've gone to the mat for you, really believed in you.How can you live with yourself? Do you even realize what it'll cost to cross me?"

The chubby girl blinked in confusion, turning to Molly. "Wait... you're adopted?"

Molly's lips stayed tightly pressed,fists clenched.

Why? Why humiliate her in front of everyone?

The girl shook Molly's arm. "Say something!"
 ###Chapter 32 She's Not Kept-She's Married


With a crowd circling around, the chubby girl clutched Molly's arm, shaking it aggressively.

Molly's face instantly darkened.

Ugh,what an idiot.

She seriously wanted to slap the girl off to the side right then.

Colder than ice, Molly's eyes narrowed, but just as quickly, she looked up with tearful, pitiful eyes like a helpless puppy.

"Megan, all these years of sisterhood, don't you care at all?" she sobbed, her voice soft and heartbreaking.

Nice move-like Megan had just dumped a lifelong sister without batting an eye.

Classic Molly. Manipulation queen.

Rachel snorted. "Oh really? And who's the one blabbing around campus about how Megan's kept by some old dude?"

He stepped forward, gaze sharp."What exactly are you trying to do, huh?"

Molly stammered, her voice breaking."1..I never said that. That wasn't me."

"Tch.Sure, maybe not word-for-word. But girl, you sure dropped enough hints to steer people in that direction. And now you're just trying to wipe your hands clean? Seriously?"

As his words bit like knives, the chubby girl jumped in. "And this has what to do with you,exactly?"

Rachel stood firm, arms crossed. "Everything, actually. You called my brother an old dude. That's not okay."

The girl rolled her eyes and tilted her double chin up. "And who the heck is your brother? Don't tell me 'your brother' is just your lame code for a sugar daddy too."
The onlookers burst out laughing.

"Ha," Megan finally let out à cold laugh.

She stepped up, mocking smile curling on her lips. "Your ugly just makes Molly look better. And your dumb helps her seem smart. That's probably the only reason she ever tolerated you."

"Liar!" the girl fired back, face red.

Megan just sighed, clicking her tongue. "If she really saw you as a friend, then why didn't she tell you who I'm actually with? Or maybe...

She lifted her left hand, showing off the ring on her ring finger."Maybe it's because... I'm not being 'kept'but married?"

"Married to who?" The question slipped from the girl's mouth-same question everyone around was thinking.

Suddenly,silence.

Then Rachel smirked and lifted his chin. "Let me introduce myself. Rachel Reid. And my brother? Also a Reid."

Everyone collectively gasped. That"old dude" just might be Tristan?!

Still clinging to hope, the girl snapped, "There are tons of Reids out there. Don't try to scare me by dropping Tristan Reid's name!"
0
Megan's face glowed with a faint smile. "Wow, sounds like in your head, you already paired me up with him.Gotta say, not boad. You've got a decent eye."

"Let me make this clear-I'm Megan. And my man? Tristan Reid."

Dead silence.

The only sound was the loud gulp of the chubby girl swallowing hard.

It was over. She was toast. Megan tilted her head and gave her a slight smile. "Being chubby can be cute. But inheriting the mindless bits too? Not so much. Don't let all that extra fat clog your brain-you can't even tell a two-faced backstabber when she's right next to you."

With that, she grabbed Rachel's hand and started wvalking out.

Instinctively, the crowd parted, giving them a wide path.

The chubby girl turned on Molly, furious. "Wow, so that's the kind of schemer you are? You let us believe Megan was some sugar baby when she's literally married to Trisan freakin' Reid? You used us like pawns!"

She fumed, nearly shouting. "And news flash-you're not even the real heiress to the Shaw family. Just a wannabe trying to fake it till you make it. Ugh! How did we not see through your act before?"

Yeah...totally blind. Aftersaying that, she dragged her friend and stormed off.

All around, classmates were shooting Molly looks full of contempt and disdain.

Guess no one expected the harmless little bunny from last year to end up being a manipulative drama queen.

Whispers and sarcastic comments filled the air as Molly clenched her jaw, grinding her teeth in frustration.

She stomped her foot angrily. "That witch! I swear I'll ruin her!"



At 4:30 in the afternoon, two sleek, low-key Bentleys pulled up outside the side gate of Meridian University.

Megan and Rachel each got into one of the cars.

The engines roared to life, and the Bentleys drove off in different directions.

Inside one of them, Tristan was holding the steering wheel with one hand and interlocking fingers with Megan with the other.

"Had a good day?" She leaned into his solid arm, eyes sparkling. "Yeah, super happy."

"Me too."

Megan blinked at him playfully. "Closed a big deal? Stock shot up? Or maybe."

Tristan's lips were curved into a faint smile from the moment she got in. "Because you announced to everyone that I'm your man."

She didn't expect him to be that easy to satisfy. It made her heart ache a little.

Looking up at his sharp-featured profile, she said softly, "Babe, what do you feel like eating tonight? I'll cook for you."

"As long as it's you who's cooking, I'll eat anything."

She just gazed at him quietly, feeling sweet all over.

Back at Dreamscape Manor.

Tristan opened the car door and helped her out gently.

They walked into the villa, nestled close to each other.

Zeta Prime stood at the door, letting out a snarky robotic laugh.

"Welcome home,Master and Goddess. Zeta Prime is 99.7% excited!"

"Alert: Scanners detect a highly suspicious item in the Goddess's bag. Shall I initiate containment

Megan's heart skipped a beat. It was talking about the bugging device, mini camera, and high-voltage stun tool in her bag.

This bucket of bolts didn't know how to shut up but sure knew how to snitch.

Smiling brightly, Megan replied, "Zeta Prime sure is one capable bot."

Its eyes flashed. "Tone analysis complete: 87% probability of sarcasm detected.Translation-Zeta Prime is being called a dumbass." Megan was amused by the robot's answer.

Tristan gave Zeta Prime a cold glance. "The lawn out front needs trimming."

Zeta Prime's optics rotated.

"Apologies. Lawn care is not in my job description. My primary functions include boosting morale, offering flirty praise, and identifying peak moments for...romantic escalation."

Megan took a deep breath. "Should we shut it down?"

Tristan's gaze darkened, voice cold. "Do it."

Zeta Prime zipped its mouth shut in a second, did a full-body spin, and bolted backward toward the east wing of the first fioor.

Tristan wrapped his arm around Megan's slim waist as they headed upstairs. "Meg, what's really in your bag? I'm kinda curious now."

Megan pressed her lips together, cheeks blazing red. "It's nothing serious. Zeta's just talking nonsense."

"Really?" Tristan's grip on her waist tightened slightly. "Zeta's record with detecting danger has never been off before."

###Chapter 33 He Couldn't Handle The Sexy Lingerie


In a pastel pink room, Megan sat on the edge of a pink bed, clutching her backpack tightly. Her cheeks were tinged with a soft blush as she looked up at Tristan, who stood towering over her.

He was seriously curious what his little wife had been doing in the black market. What had she gone there to buy that might be dangerous?

Sure,he was curious-but more than anything, he just didn't want her getting caught up in something risky.

Megan slowly unzipped the backpack and silently pulled out two high-voltage stun guns. "Here, these. I got three-keeping one for myself, giving one to Rachel, and planning to give the last to Chloe."

"That's the 'female products' you were talking about?" he raised an eyebrow.

Megan nodded seriously. "Girls need something to protect themselves, especially when they're out alone."

Well,the stuff was real, but did she really need to go all the way to the black market for this?

Tristan narrowed his sharp, fox-like eyes. "Anything else sketchy in that bag?"

Megan shook her head hard. "Nope! That's all, promise."

But seeing that he still looked a little skeptical, she didn't want this to turn into some pointless misunderstanding. So, after taking a deep breath, she pulled out five sets of sexy lingerie from the bag and shoved them into his arms, then bolted off toward the walk-in closet.

She needed to buy time to hide the listening devices, trackers, surveillance gear, and some medical supplies she had also brought back.

Once everything was safely tucked away, she stepped out again, only to find Tristan still frozen in place,clothes clutched to his chest.

She walked over and took a closer look. His usually pale face had turned completely red. His breaths came heavy, like he was fighting off some kind of urge."What's with you?" she asked, genuinely puzzled.

Hearing her soft, worried voice, Tristan tossed the bundle back onto the bed and suddenly scooped her up.sealing her lips with his.

No idea how much time passed, but all Megan knew was that her back met the plush softness of the bed.Tristan's warm hand had found its way under her white shirt, steadily tracing upward along her curves until it rested on something soft.

He whispered against her ear, "So. you went there to buy this stuff,huh?"

No wonder she went all that way-probably embarrassed to get it somewhere closer.

And those stun guns? Yeah. she could've picked them up from a regular shop.

Clearly, he'd misunderstood his sweet little wife.

She was way too innocent to even know what really goes down in places like the black market.

Megan was speechless. Could she admit she only bought the lingerie because, well, it was along the way?Probably best not.

She turned her blushing face away slightly. "I thought you might like it."

Tristan's throat bobbed, his voice low and raspy. "Like it? Babe, you could be dressed like a burrito, and I'd still be totally into you."

Megan bit her lip, stifling a laugh."Pervert."

Leaning in close, he gently bit her rosy earlobe."Just wait till your birthday-our wedding night. That's when I'll really show you what being a pervert means."

His shameless words kind of turned her on a little.She gave Tristan a light shove. "Hey, you're crushing me.You're heavy,you know."

With a low chuckle, he rolled off and lay beside her.

Megan sat up, smoothed down her rumpled shirt, then casually grabbed a bright red lingerie set. She opened the clear packaging and pulled it out.

Calling it delicate would be an understatement-it was practically see-through.

Even she couldn't help blushing just looking at it.

Holding it up against herself, she peered up with a mischievous grin. "Honey, does it look good?"

Tristan slowly sat up, his gaze full of smoldering heat.

She looked so damn good, it was killing him.

Every pulse in his body was screaming.

That little tease was clearly doing this to mess with him.

Megan raised an eyebrow. "Wanna see me try it on?"

Tristan gulped, then felt a sudden warmth drip from his nose.

He wiped it with the back of his hand-he pulled an anime nosebleed just now.

Megan, startled, grabbed his arm and pulled him toward the bathroom.

While cleaning him up, she mumbled, ""Are you okay? You're probably a little run down. I'll make you some chicken soup later..."

Watching this oblivious little minx who juşt set his body on fire, Tristan took a deep breath.

If it weren't for her birthday meaning so much, he would've lost control right then and there.

Once the bleeding stopped, Megan took his hand and headed back to the bed.

"There's more for you to see. I brought other styles too, even a little 'uniform surprise'. Hey, where are you going?"

She stuck out her tongue at his retreating back. "Let's see if you can actually hold out 'til my birthday.Maybe you'll explode first!" Tristan fled straight to the guest bathroom for a cold shower.

After cooling off and slipping into a black silk pajama set, he went looking for her-but the bedroom was empty.

Downstairs, he bumped into Mrs. Jones.

She gave a polite nod. "Sir, ma'am is making chicken soup for you."

Tristan made his way to the kitchen.

There she was-Megan, in a blush pink apron cinched at the waist, white frills fluttering with every movement.

A butterfly clip sparkled in her hair, completely at odds with her usual ice-queen demeanor.

She stirred the pot with calm precision, like she'd done it a thousand times-only this time, looking like a domestic fantasy brought to life.

Tristan came up behind her and wrapped his arms around that tiny waist. "Thanks, babe."

She set down the ladle, turned with glistening eyes, and asked sweetly, "Hubby, how do I look in my maid outfit?"

Absolute killer move.

Instinctively, Tristan reached for his nose-thankfully, no blood this time.

Megan burst out laughing, threw her arms around his neck, tiptoed, and gave his lips a quick kiss.

She nuzzled into his solid chest. "If you really can'thold it in, then don't. What, you training to be a ninja or buddhist monk something?"

He gently pinched her chin and squinted playfully."You've got a dangerous mouth, you know that?"

"Then maybe you should shut me up-with a kiss!"

Megan leaned in andkissed him, long and sweet-until the duck soup burned. Tristan softly traced her lips with his finger. "I've got a surprise for you."Megan's eyes sparkled with curiosity. "You've already given me so many gifts. What is it this time?"

"Take a guess."

"A baby!"

Tristan was shocked by her answer.

He took her hand and led her out of the kitchen. When they passed by Mrs. Jones wiping the table, he said,"Mrs. Jones, you'll be in charge ofdinner tonight."

"Yes, sir." Mrs. Jones grinned, watching the couple heading upstairs, her smile full-on auntie mode.

Once they stepped into the study, they walked around the desk. Tristan dropped into the leather chair,easily pulling Megan into his lap.

He opened a drawer and pulled out a small box."Here.Open it."

Megan unwrapped the box and found a ten-centimeter-tall robotic dog inside.

"Press the spot under its tail."

"Wait-what? That sounds kinda freaky!" Megan raised an eyebrow, clearly skeptical.

"After you scan your fingerprint, it's officially yours."

She followed his instructions.

The tiny dog's eyes lit up blue,its little head turning as it let out two soft barks.

In a babyish tone, it chirped,"My name is Nova! Wow, are you my beautiful and irresistibly charming master?"

Megan looked back at him. "So this lttle thing's fully Al? Another one from Professor XAL?"

Tristan nodded slightly. "You like it?" 
"l do." Megan's eyes narrowed like a teasing fox. "But hubby, what's your deal with Professor XAL? Is XAL a guy or a girl? You two seem super tight. No one's ever released Al robots with consciousness before."

Tristan cleared his throat. "He's a guy. I've been funding his research, mostly stuff that'll help Reid Corp's future development in tech."

Which explained why he could afford to donate so many of Professor XAL's experimental devices.

That suddenly reminded her of the talk she had with the shop owner-about that advanced tracking and listening device. She asked, "Do you work with a company called Dracopower?"

He nodded. "Yeah, we've got some partnerships. Some of Professor XAL's tech is being applied in communications and satellites. Why do you ask all of a sudden?"

Megan smiled like nothing was up. "Kevin's company develops that kind of stuff, right? Figured you two must be collaborating. That guy acts like he invented sliced bread, but turns out it's just my husband backing him up from behind the scenes."

Since Tristan had business ties with Dracopower, she couldn't just stand by if something went wrong there.

Resting her head lightly against him, she continued, "Babe, with someone like that in charge, that company's bound to be crawling with corporate spies, don't you think?"

"Eh.maybe not?" Tristan's response didn't even convince himself.

Megan pouted. "That's not very reassuring. If you keep working with him, give him a heads-up at least!"

"Alright," Tristan chuckled. "Now, this robot dog's got tons of features. Let me show you."
 ###Chapter 34 Reid Style: Kiss First,Ask Later


Early in the morning.

When Megan opened her sleepy eyes, Tristan was already staring at her without blinking.

Embarrassed, she quickly tugged the thin blanket up to cover her blushing face.

"Don't look at me like that. My face's gonna turn into a tomato."

Hearing her half-joking voice, Tristan reached out to gently tug the blanket down. "Come on, let me see how red it really is."

Megan let out a soft huff and rolled to the edge of the bed before hopping down. "Enough flirting, I'm going to wash up."

She stuck her tongue out and dashed into the bathroom.

Looking at herself in the mirror, her neck, collarbones, and even her soft, fair skin were all marked in red.
"Damn it, are you a werewolf or what?"

"How much foundation do I need to cover this up."

After washing up, she walked out and took a seat at her vanity, starting her skincare routine.

Tristan leaned lazily against the headboard, admiring the doll-like girl reflected in the mirror. His heart was totally full just watching her.

Lifting the blanket, he got out of bed and made his way over with his long strides, leaning against the vanity casually.

As Megan applied primer, she looked up, "Aren't you gonna get ready?"

Tristan grinned, "Already did. Want proof? Come taste the mint."

Before she could react, he leaned in and kissed her lightly. He brushed the tip of her nose with a fingertip. "Well? Do you believe me now?"

Megan's lips curled into a smile as she looked down.

Opening her lipstick case, rows of different colors and brands-hundreds of them-were laid out.

"Pick one for me."

Tristan looked at her flawless skin. Honestly, any shade would work-even those 'danger zones' most people couldn't pull off.

He picked out a cherry blossom pink. "Let me do it."

Megan's eyes lit up as she tilted her head toward him, ready.

But instead of applying it the normal way, Tristan swiped it over his own lips first, then leaned in and kissed her again.

Megan's eyes flew open at the warm touch.

After pulling away, he smiled smugly. "Done. If you don't like it, I can redo it."

She looked in the mirror, pouting at the soft pink color. "Seriously? That's how you put on lipstick?"

"Reid Style," Tristan said seriously. "And I'm a pro in more areas than one."

Did he mean what she thought he meant?

Thinking about the night before-doing everything but that one final step-Megan blushed so hard it reached her ears.

Her heart was racing like crazy. She jumped up and ran toward the walk-in closet while tossing out,"1"m getting dressed!"

Watching her flee shyly, Tristan couldn't help the smile tugging athis lips.

He then went to the other room to change clothes too.

Dressed in a white tee, jeans, and slightly worn sneakers, Megan packed a new listening device, stun gun, and some medical supplies into her bag before heading out.

Tristan was leaning against the closet door, freshly dressed in a tailored black suit. Tall, elegant, and downright irresistible.

When he saw her, he pulled her into his arms right away. "Maybe I should renovate the wardrobe. Make it big enough for the both of us next time."

Megan blinked, a little confused.

He leaned in, warm breath brushing her neck. "Then we can get dressed together."

She bit her lip and gave his chest a playful jab. "You're such a perv."

His low chuckle rumbled close to her ea. "Might need to reapply that lipstick, babe."

She glanced at her watch. "Come on, I'm gonna be late."

Tristan finally let her go and followed her downstairs for breakfast.

After eating, they each got into their cars and drove out of Dreamscape Manor.Tristan's car kept a steady distance behind Megan's all the way to the front gate of Meridian University. Only after watching her arrive safely did he merge into traffic and drive off.

Since Rachel was taking their aunt in for a checkup today, Megan didn't need to wait for her.

She had already agreed to meet Chloe at the school gate to hand her the stun gun.

Before long, a Rolls-Royce pulled up behind her car.

Chloe hopped out, and right after, came Kevin-apparently now her personal chauffeur.

Chloe slid into the passenger seat of Megan's car, a sweet smile tugging at the dimples on her cheeks."Morning, Meg!"

Kevin ran a hand through his overly styled hair and bent slightly to greet her."Hey,Meg! Morning!"

The grin on his face couldn't scream "wannabe her brother-in-law" any louder. Megan pulled the stun gun from her bag and handed it over, walking Chloe through how to use it.

She glanced at Kevin, who was lingering by the car, and said loudly, "If he tries anything sketchy, don't even hesitate.Shock him."

Kevin:[So.this thing is for me? Are you kidding me?/(T o T)/~~]

Chloe nodded seriously. "Don't worry, sis, I won't go easy on him! Alright, I'm off then!"

Megan gave a small nod. "Lunch together later?"

Chloe chuckled. "Ha! Goofball Bro's taking me to a Michelin-starred place."

Yup, just as she expected-this girl's got zero resistance when it comes to food and fluff talk.

Watching Kevin guide Chloe across the street, Megan couldn't help but think he looked like a wannabe sugar daddy escorting a baby-faced girl.

Ugh.Creepy much?

Megan drove into the campus and parked near the main academic building.

She grabbed her bag, got out, and headed toward the building.

"OMG, look at that Maybach-license plate ends in 888! That's gotta be Tristan's ride."

"Totally! No wonder someone dropped a fortune building that new library."

"Moral of the story? Don't even think about messing with that chick."

"You heard what happened yesterday? Nine families linked to people who messed with her got dragged into it."

"Of course I know! Lillian's dad even begged my old man for help. Why would anyone go up against Tristan?"

Fearful murmurs floated around-though, as always, someone just couldn't help stirring the pot. "Pfft, what's the big deal? Look at her. Nine out of ten, she's just great in bed. Otherwise, no way she'd still be hanging onto Tristan."

"Hey now, be nice. Everyone's got something good about them."

Megan turned her head slightly and gave the girl who made the first comment a sharp look. "Hey, green hair-your wrist all healed up? Wanna try the other one next?"

Natalie recoiled like a startled cat, hiding her hands behind her back.

Megan let out a soft scoff. "Scared now, huh? Maybe keep that mouth shut next time-or things could get way worse for you."

Then, she looked over at the other girl: Amelia Lewis, daughter of the Lewis family in Lindon City.

Megan didn't like her.People usually hung out with those who were like them.

If Amelia and Natalie were close, then Megan figured she was trouble too.

Amelia smiled politely and gave a nod. "Hey, Megan. I'm Amelia. There's a lecture later-wanna sit together?"

Natalie suddenly looked like a kid abandoned at recess, silently fuming, her lips pressed tight and jealousy flashing in her eyes.

"Sorry, all the seats near me are taken. No room for extras. And if you keep talking to me, your little follower over there might just explode from jealousy-her eyesare practically glowing green."

Natalie flushed red and clenched her fists.

"I am not jealous!"

Megan rubbed her chin, thinking about Kai-how he was betrothed to Natalie but clearly had a thing for Rachel instead.

Technically speaking... that did count as cheating, didn't it?

She glanced back at Natalie, who looked like she was about to combust. Megan let out a soft laugh.

###Chapter 35 Cute Bot, Killer Shot


Megan sat in the last row by the back door.

As soon as the teacher turned to write on the board, she slipped out of the classroom without a sound.

She didn't drive today-left her car at school on purpose because Tristan's car had a tracker. No way she'd risk it.

Ever since her rebirth, her goal was clear-put Molly and Wyatt behind bars, and make them pay.

She'd already planted the tracker on Molly's phone. Now, it was Wyatt's turn.

So here she was, heading to the hospital to get the job done.

The cab pulied up at the entrance of Benevita Hospital's inpatient building.

Wearing a baseball cap, mask, and sunglasses, Megan slung her backpack over her shoulder and walked in.

She made her way up to the tenth floor-Benevita Hospital-and quietly slipped into a janitor's closet.

She changed into a nurse's uniform, put on the cap and mask, grabbed the syringe she'd prepped, and walked into the nurses' station.

One nurse was busy preparing meds for Wyatt, getting stuff ready for a dressing change.

"I'll handle it," Megan said.

The nurse blinked, "I haven't seen you before?"

"Just got assigned here. Intern," Megan replied calmly.

The nurse remembered there was a new batch starting today. Plus, she needed the bathroom anyway."Alright, help me out. Room 3-Wyatt Reid." "Got it."
As the nurse dashed off, Megan casually injected a heavy sedative into the antibiotic vial, then pushed the medical cart out.

Room 3 was a private suite-Wyatt was the only patient there.

He looked up as she walked in. "Some kind of checkup?"

"Just changing the dressing," she replied, altering her voice a little.

He didn't question it, eyes glued to his phone.

She swapped out the empty bottle for the full one and tidied up the medical trash.

Moments later, Wyatt slumped over,unconscious.

Megan darted to his bedside, grabbed his phone, and began installing the tracking software.

Done in under a minute.

She rebooted the phone and reopened the last page he'd been browsing.

Gross. Dude was checking out adult sites.

Staring at that face she couldn't stand, she really wanted to give him a dose of air and send him to hell. But that wasn't her way-revenge wasn't about becoming a monster like them.

She pushed the cart out without looking back.

Back in the janitor's closet, she grabbed her backpack and left the tenth floor.

She changed out of the nurse uniform in a women's restroom, then walked out of the hospital like nothing happened.

Once back at Meridian University, she opened her laptop inside her car, hacked into Benevita Hospital's surveillance system, and edited herself out of the video footage.

Just to be extra careful, she also put up a firewall so tough even that so-called "God of Hackers" couldn't crack it. Meanwhile, in a computer science class, a guy suddenly sneezed.

He frowned, feeling something was off. Probably that idiot BlackWing making jokes about him again.

When the bell rang, he packed up his laptop, notes, and a blinged-out Boheme Royal fountain pen, then got ready to leave.

A girl with a sweet face blocked his way. She blushed, nervously handing him a box of chocolates. "Hi, uh.Samuel,1.I made these."

As we all know, Samuel was the heir of the Lewis family. He is not only rich but also handsome.

Samuel looked annoyed. "I'vegot a toothachehe said flatly.

Stepping past her, he walked straight out of the classroom.

The girl's face crumpled, like she was about to cry.The guy next to her tried to comfort her, "Girl, you're not alone.Samuel turns down over ten girls a day. Don't take it too hard."

Another guy chuckled, "Maybe he's not into girls?"

The girl froze. "Wait.does that mean he likes guys?"

Meanwhile, Megan was hurrying to the first lecture hall for her photo-editing class.

Cries of pain echoed from the nearby grove.

As she got closer, she recognized the person being beaten-wasn't that the glasses guy who helped her livestream yesterday?

He was being kicked around by the same three guys who got beat up yesterday.

Failing to get back at her, they chose an easy target to let off steam. Really classy.

"Hey! Cowards!"

The three froze and looked her way.

Megan had striking features, long black hair flowing down her back, and carried herself with an icy elegance.

Suddenly,a bleached-blond punk pufled a fruit knife from his pocket, eyes bloodshot and full of rage. "You damn b°tch! You ruined my family's business! I'm gonna end you today!"

Knife raised, he charged at her.

Megan's narrow fox-like eyes narrowed, dark pupils locking onto the glint of the incoming blade.

She calmly reached into the side pocket of her backpack and, in one smooth motion, flung something toward him.

A sharp "awoo!" rang out mid-air, and the next second, a steel dart shot from the object, hitting the bleached-blond punk square in the neck.

His knees buckled, and with a thud, he collapsed and passed out cold.

The object landed precisely on the ground, then turned toward Megan and trotted over with stiff little steps.

"Scared Nova needs a hug! Pretty lady, hold me-awoo~~"

Megan picked it up by the scruff, clearly unimpressed, and shoved it back in her bag's side pocket.

A robotic wolf howling but acting like a scared puppy? Seriously?

Useless thing was all bark and no bite.

Nova was the robot dog Tristan had given her last night.

That dart just now? Yep-came right out of its mouth.

"Oops, not sure if that dart's got any nasty viruses like HIV onMegan said,poutng at the two other boys beside the glasses guy. "Wanna give it a try yourselves?"

The other two boys stood frozen, still trying to make sense of what had happened. They couldn't tell what took bleached-blond punk down, but it was obvious that freaky talking dog had something to do with it.

They were on the verge of tears. They hadn't thought bleached-blond punk would go full psycho and try to kill Megan!

All they wanted was to vent a little-no one actually planned on committing murder!

Especially not against Tristan's woman.

The two boys' knees started to bend as if about to kneel.

"Huh!" Megan scoffed coldly. "Keep your knees. I'm not interested in your groveling."

A creepy smile curled on her lips as she crouched and picked up the fruit knife, twirling it between her fingers.

Then, without flinching, she used the bladeto flip bleached-blond punk's right hand face-up, the one he'd been holding the knife with earlier, and drove the knife straight through-clean through his palm.

Blood spattered onto her pale face, making her look wild and strangely enchanting.

Bleached-blond punk didn't move, lying there like a dead mutt.

Megan slowly stood up, pulled out a wet wipe to clean her hands, then used a compact mirror to wipe off the blood from her face.

Humming a cheerful tune, she whipped out her phone and made a call.

The second the line connected, her expression flipped, voice trembling, "Hi, I'm Megan Shaw,a student at Meridian University. Someone just tried to kill me. I'm really scared. Can you come quickly? I'm behind the first lecture hall, in the little grove."

Glasses Guy:"......"

The two boys:"......"

Finally figured it out-Nova's totally a mini version of its owner. They're basically two of a kind.
###Chapter 36 She Cuts Deep-With Words and Blades


Megan tilted her chin at the three boys standing there like statues. "You know what to say later, right?"

The two guys nodded like bobbleheads. "Got it, got it. We'll say Manuel tried to attack you, tripped himself and got stabbed by accident."

"Miss Shaw, we really didn't mean to hurt you."

Megan replied softly while typing something on her phone.

A moment later, the bleached-blond punk's phone chimed-he'd gotten a message.

Megan walked over to the two boys and shot a glance at the one with glasses. "Four-Eyes, stay at least five meters away from me."

The guy freaked and scrambled ten meters away, hiding behind a big tree and peeking out nervously,like he was worried blood might start flying.

Walking up to the two boys, Megan nodded toward them. "Lucky for you, it's not a capital offense. But don't think you're getting off easy."

Her lips curled into a sly, almost sinister smile. Her eyes flicked down to her phone again-three new messages popped up, making her mood soar.

Right then, a deep voice cut in.

"You stabbed someone and you're threatening people to lie for you? That's not exactly clean."

Megan's smile vanished instantly.

Wait, who just jumped in with that out-of-context comment?

She turned around to see a tall guy-probably about six-foot-three-dressed in white sportswear, baseball cap pulled low, backpack over his shoulder, walking toward her.
His face was pale, nose sharp, lips curled into a slightly mocking grin. Even with his eyes shaded by the cap,the disdain in his gaze was obvious.

Megan let out a scoff."Judging things without knowing the full story? Aren't you being a bit hasty?"

The guy opened his mouth to reply, but a ping interrupted him-his phone buzzed with a new text.

Megan glanced at her own phone, face completely calm, although inside she was practically doing cartwheels.

Looks like this dude's loaded.

She casually closed out of the app, leaving no trace behind.

The boy checked his phone, brows furrowing slightly.

He pulled off his cap, revealing narrow, fox-like eyes now filled with suspicion. "Did you mess with something?"

Megan blinked innocently. "What are you talking about?"

He stepped closer, towering over her, eyes flashing dangerously. "There's a zero missing from my account.Thirty million just turned into three million."

Meghan:[Admit it? Yeah, no way.]

She gave a slight shake of her head. "I seriously have no clue what you're talking about."

His expression chilled, but his tone suddenly shifted, softening. "What's your name?"

"Megan Shaw."

"You're from the Shaw family? The runaway bride?"

She cleared her throat-why did people always have to bring that up?

"I mean... look, dude, if you've got nothing better to do, maybe don't add to the chaos here. The cops are showing up soon to take statements, and I really don't want you skewing the whole story."
He smirked like he hadn't heard a word she said. "You don't think we kinda look alike? Especially the eyes."

Honestly, the first time Megan saw him, she did feel a weird sense of familiarity.

And now that he mentioned it. yeah, maybe there was something there.

"Samuel Lewis.Senior in Software Engineering-Computer Science track. You're a freshman, right? I outrank you."

Megan glanced over with a teasing smile. "Alright, got it.Do I call you Sam the Sham?”

Samuel:[Is she actually serious right now?]

Four-Eyes: [That's the one and only Fourth Young Master of the Lewis family in Lindon City.]

The two other boys: [Can we just leave now?]

Megan really couldn't be more unimpressed with this cliché pick-up move.

And especially when it came from Amelia's older brother.

She had zero good feelings for that girl.Anyone buddy-buddy with Natalie? Definitely not someone she'd get along with.

So naturally, she threw Samuel into the same category.

Samuel picked up on the indifference in her eyes and chuckled. "Give me your phone."

Megan raised an eyebrow-guess he thought she'd messed with his bank account.

Fine,let him check!

Bring it on.

She calmly handed the phone over."Go ahead. I don't see how a missing zero in your account's my problem."

He dialed a number from her phone, and the very next moment, Samuel's own phone buzzed in his pocket. Handing her phone back, he said, "That number I just called? It's mine. Feel free to save it."

What?

So it wasn't about suspecting her?

Dude just wanted her number.

At that moment, the two boys also started freaking out about missing money in their accounts.

Samuel's face turned cold; his voice cut through like ice. "Stop yelling like paranoid freaks. I misread it,alright?"

Megan watched his sudden shift and could smell the ulterior motives from a mile away.

She never left room for misread signals or flirtation drama.

She coolly lifted her left ring finger to show off her wedding band. "I'm married. Get it?"

Samuel blinked."Tristan Reid?"

Megan lightly brushed her ring with her fingers. "Use those sharp eyes of yours. You figure it out."

He let out a low whistle. "Ain't it nice to gain a handsome friend on the side?"

She twitched her lips, already done with him.

The last thing she needed was some pretend friend. Tristan was all she ever wanted.

Just then, two girls walked over-none other than Natalie and Amelia.

The moment they spotted bleached-blond punk lying in a pool of blood, they gasped in shock.

Amelia circled around and rushed to Samuel's side, her voice syrupy sweet. "Samuel..."

Samuel stayed cold and distant."Mm."

Tucking her dark hair behind an ear, Amelia turned to Megan. "Megan, what happened here?" Natalie snorted. "Let me guess, Megan-this your handiwork? First, you beat someone up, now you're pulling knives?"

Natalie had to be one of those people who left their brain at home.

Megan shot her a chilly glance."You know how there are sixteen personality types?"

Natalie blinked. "Yeah...like INFP, ENTJ,stuff like that?"

Megan smirked."Right. You're the missing one-ID10T."

Natalie's face contorted. "Wait-ID10T.? Are you calling me an idiot?!"

Megan simply tilted her chin toward Natalie's hand. "Forgot the pain already, huh?"

Natalie's expression instantly shifted, and her arrogance deflated just like that.

Amelia moved in with a concerned look. "Did those guys try to come after you? Are you hurt?"

Megan replied flatly, "Nope. Thanks though."

Right after her words dropped, Natalie suddenly gasped loud enough to turn heads, hands clamped over her mouth.
###Chapter 37 Long-lost Sister


The bleached-blond punk suddenly jerked awake, stumbled to his feet, and whipped out a fruit knife,charging at them like a lunatic.

The robot dog was compact and packed with features, but that came at a cost-its tranquilizer darts only worked for about five minutes tops.

So, during that brief moment Megan and the others were talking, the bleached-blond punk had already come to.

He made a beeline for Megan and Amelia.

Just as he was about to reach them, Megan was yanked to the side into a warm embrace, while Amelia got shoved to the ground.

The bleached-blond punk missed his mark and staggered forward, blinking rapidly, trying to keep his focus.Then,he turned and lunged at Megan again.

Samuel let go of Megan, raised his leg, and cleanly kicked the fruit knife out of The bleached-blond punk's hand. Without even pausing, he landed a hard punch to the guy's face, knocking him out cold.

He turned to Megan. "You okay?"

Megan shook her head.

Honestly, she was a little thrown off by what just happened.

I mean, this guy didn't think twice before shielding a complete stranger but knocked his own sister aside?

She couldn't deny her own charm had something to do with it, but still... poor Amelia, having such a flaky brother.

Not that Megan needed help, anyway. She was totally capable of handling things herself. What a guy-meddling where he's not even needed.

Amella just stared at her brother, her pretty eyes glassy with unshed tears.

Natalie helped her up. "Are you hurt, Amelia? Seriously, what's up with your brother? Why push you aside just to protect Megan?"

Amelia blinked back the tears and forced out, "I'm fine. The guy was aiming for Megan, so she was in more danger.My brother made the right call."

Natalie muttered under her breath, "Yeah, but you're his sister. Shouldn't that count for something?"

Amelia lowered her eyes, her arms limp at her sides. If she really was his sister...wouldn't he have chosen to protect her first?

Right then, three police cars pulled up at the edge of the woods.

Three officers stepped out of each vehicle, rounding up the bleached-blond punk and the two other guys who had gotten violent.

Everyone else was told to follow them back to the station.


Meanwhile,high up in the executive office on the 88th floor of the Reid Corporation, Tristan looked cold and composed as ever.

Eyes locked on the red dot moving across the map on his phone screen-he'd started tracking it as soon as Megan left Meridian University.

He saw it stop for a brief fifteen-minute window at Benevita Hospital before returning to the university, and then darting out again, only to finally halt at the police station.

At first,he'd tried to piece together why she was at the hospital. But once he saw she ended up at the police station, he could no longer sit still.

He didn't dare to call her right away either-she was sharp, and if he pushed too hard, she'd definitely figure out he'd planted a tracker on her. Just as he was chewing over what to do, the police called to inform him to come get "his person."

Tristan grabbed his suit jacket and walked out of the office without another word. Cameron quickly followed,calling out, "Mr. Reid, the executive meeting starts in five minutes."

Tristan's tone turned icy, "Push it to tomorrow.n

Watching as the doors to the CEO's private elevator slid shut, Cameron muttered under his breath,"Figures.That drama queen must be acting up again. Even a falling sky wouldn't shake Mr. Reid, but now look-he's totally under her spell."

At the Pingdu Police Station, a sleek black Bentley drifted neatly to a stop at the entrance.

With a crisp motion, Tristan opened the door and strode in.

Chief Ford personally came out to greet him. "Mr. Reid, you're here. Your wife is giving her statement in the interrogation room."

Tristan paused. "Interrogation room?"

Chief Ford hesitated for a beat. "Yes."

"That kind of place is where you put my woman?" Tristan pulled out his phone. "Linus, where the hell are you?"

"I'm here! Just walked in."

Footsteps:echoed as Linus jogged over,sweating profusely."S-sorry, Mr. Reid."

Tristan shot him a chilling glance. "Do that again, and you better not show your face around me again."

Linus sucked in a breath. "Understood."

Just then, Megan stepped out of the interrogation room. Her eyes lit up as she ran into the tall man's embrace. "Babe, you're here."

Tristan wrapped his arms around her, genty patting her back.sover now. Let's go home. Linus will handle the rest." He turned to Linus. "I told you to come down hard on him. How did that guy even get another chance to pull a knife?

Linus's expression froze-seriously? It was just a fight yesterday, and the guy had gotten beat up. How was he supposed to go overboard?

But today was different. The guy had come armed.

Linus promised firmly, "Don't worTy, sir."

Right then, Samuel walked out of another room.

He paused when he saw the couple hugging, then flashed a slight smnile."Mr.Reid."

Tristan gave a small nod. "Thanks for stepping in, Mr. Lewis. If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask.!"

Samuel responded calmly, "It was nothing."

As he watched Tristan walk away with Megan in his arms, his gaze darkened.

"Sam!"

A sweet voice called out as he turned back.

Amelia and Natalie were approaching. Amelia smiled up at himn. "Sam, join us for dinner tonight?"

His polite smile faded into indifference. "Can't. Got other plans."

And with that, he turned and left.

Natalie pouted and clung to Amelia's arm. "Jeez. Your brother's like a block of ice."

She glanced in the direction he'd left. "Though, he wasn't that cold with Megan. Suspicious."

"Tch. That Megan sure is something...Always snagging attention wherever she goes."

Amelia kept her eyes on Samuel's retreating figure, voice soft, "Natalie, do you think Megan kind of.looks like my brother?"

Natalie squinted, trying to picture their faces. "Huh! You know what. There is something there."Amelia raised an eyebrow. "Those eyes... don't they look kinda familiar?"

Natalie rubbed her chin thoughtfully. "You know what, now that you mention it-they really do!"

A strange glint flashed in Amelia's eyes, just a flicker of red deep down.

Meanwhile, after walking out of the police station, Samuel slid into his Aston Martin.

He didn't drive off right away. Instead, he pulled out his laptop from his backpack and opened it up.

His account really was short by a zero today-thirty million turned into just three mil.

The culprit? A notorious, sleazy hacking tool called "Fortune Leech."

A nasty little invention courtesy of Blackwing, a hacker who made Samuel grit his teeth in frustration every time he heard the name.

Once the program is activated, it sucks a zero off any account within five meters from the user-doesn't matter how much money is in there.

To this day, no one's been able to crack it. Not even him.

Blackwing was clever, twisted, and seemed to have no moral compass whatsoever.

Samuel had never lost battles in the cyber world.except to Blackwing. Over and over again.

For,a while, things had been peaceful. Blackwing disappeared six months ago, and Samuel had finally been able to breathe.

But yesterday, a massive deal landed on his desk-ten million on the line. And guess who swooped in,snatched it, and gave it away for free?

Yep.Blackwing.

His blood was still boiling.

It wasn't even about the cash anymore-the guy had stomped all over his rep. He was supposed to be the god of hacking, the best of the best. And now? Overshadowed by/a cockroach hiding in the dark.

Then-today of all days-Samuel spotted that same cursed program on some random girl's device.

Megan Shaw.

He had a hunch there was a link between her and Blackwing.

If so, she might be the key to tracking him down.

That's why he asked for her number-looking for a trail to follow.

His slender fingers danced across the keyboard, window after window of code popping up as he dove into the bank system.

He typed in Megan's phone number, hoping to unlock account info-maybe find ties to a familiar bank account.

But nope. Everything was blocked. Her data was locked behind an ironclad firewall.

He tried pulling up random accounts to check. No problem at all.

Yeah, that confirmed it-Megan's profile alone was heavily protected. That firewall wasn't standard; that beast was tailor-made.

Samuel smirked. Now this was getting interesting.

He didn't get any direct info, sure. But that one clue said plenty-someone powerful was shielding her.

And the likely suspect? Blackwing. He was the only one Samuel had ever lost to. So yeah, Megan wasn't just some average girl. Also, yeah, the phone number wasn't just about the hack.

It was the eyes.Those bright, familiar eyes.

He pulled out his phone and dialed.

"Hey, Brandon, I found a girl whose eyes seriously look just like mine. What if she's our long-lost sister?" A lazy voice answered, "Here we go again. Quit daydreaming, man. I'm busy."

Samuel froze."...You're kidding me...
###Chapter 38 Darknight Bar


Dreamscape Manor.

Tristan took off his suit jacket and hung it on the rack.

He rolled up his sleeves, revealing toned, fair forearms.

He was dying to ask Megan why she went to the hospital-

But he held back.

Instead,he gently scooped her into his arms and asked softly,"Scared?"

Megan instantly switched modes and leaned into him, "Yeah, I'm seriously freaking out."

Right then, Nova Tech poked its head out from the side pocket of a backpack and bounced down onto the carpet. In its baby-like voice, it called out, "Goddess just went stab-stab-no flinch, no blink! Blood everywhere! Liar detected~!"

Megan's forehead twitched. Seriously? This thing was totally Zeta Prime's cousin-

Both loved backstabbing their owner!

"Nova's scared~ Goddess, hughug~~"

Megan rolled her eyes hard.

Really? Betraying her and then begging for a hug? Absolutely not!

Tristan let her down and picked up the robot dog that had latched onto Megan's pants.

"Megan, you know when you entered your fingerprint, the bot analyzed your personality? It kinda...absorbed your vibe and emotional patterns."

Megan squinted. Oh, so basically-this thing took after her.Seriously? That was messed up!

She was honest, fearless, loyal, disciplined, righteous, wise and completely above board! When did she turn into such...dog material??

Nova's voice piped up again, "Warning: Emotional spike detected- Goddess's about to explode! Nova is terrified! Master,requesting immediate extraction~"

It flailed its short legs, trying to scramble away.

Tristan chuckled lowly. "Wanna dismantle it?"

Before Megan could say anything, two drops of oil dripped onto the pale pink carpet.

Wait,what the heck?

Tristan looked down, face full of disdain. "It peed itself."

Megan wrinkled her nose, just as unimpressed. "Too lame. Definitely nothing like me."

Tristan reached out and gently booped her nose. "Right, right, nothing like you. You're the bravest one here.

I gotta step out for a bit. Might be back late, don't wait up."

Megan wrapped her arms around his waist and looked up, wide-eyed. "Where are you going?"

"The hacker's in custody. We're nabbing the driver tonight."

"I wanna come with!" Megan buried her head in his chest, rubbing against him like a cat. "Take me with you,please? You're the best husband ever!"

Hearing her soft and sugary voice made him melt.

"Alright, you can come. But you have to stick close to me, no wandering, and definitely no charging in."

Megan quickly planted a kiss on his cheek."Muah!" After dinner, they changed into sporty outfits and baseball caps, then headed out from Dreamscape Manor.

The Capitol City was buzzing by 8 PM. Cars jammed the streets, neon lights lit up the skyline, and the stars were nowhere to be seen.

They parked in front of a place called Darknight Bar.

Hand in hand, they walked inside.

They passed through a hallway filled with couples making out on either side. Up ahead was a dance floor flashing with rainbow-colored lights.

The place reeked of smoke, booze, and sweat.

Heavy bass pounded like a second heartbeat in their ears.Men and women swayed wildly to the pounding beats, trying to drown out their loneliness and emptiness on the dance floor.

Tristan wrapped his arm firmly around Megan's waist, not letting the crowd pull her away.

They made their way to the back exit, where two burly bodyguards stood like statues.

Tristan pulled two tickets from his jeans pocket.

After checking them, the guards stepped aside and let them in.

The moment they passed the door, the air changed-deafening cheers and angry shouts filled the space.

The stench of sweat and blood hit them like a slap, sharp and nauseating.

They were inside an underground fight club.

Two brawny men were going head-to-head in the ring, fists flying and muscles straining.

Tristan led Megan to the front-row VIP seats.

He handed her a subtly scented handkerchief. "Might help with the smell."
 
Megan didn't hesitate and took it. She glanced toward the fighters. "Is it that tall one?°

Tristan gave a crooked smile, "You're underestimating him."

Megan raised an eyebrow. Clearly, the real deal hadn't shown up yet.

Well, no rush-the bastard they were after wouldn't be slipping away tonight.

Might as well enjoy the fight first.

In the ring, the slightly taller man had his arm clamped brutally around the other's neck, spitting curses through gritted teeth.

With a violent twist, the shorter man's head dropped. His body went limp like a puppet with its strings cut.

The victor raised both fists high, feeding off the cheers from the packed crowd.

Not a soul spared a glance at the man lying motionless. Instead, angry swears poured down-he'd just lost them a fortune.

Four young guys came in to drag the dead fighter off the ring.

The referee climbed in from the side steps.

Shouting into the mic, he hyped up the next round."And now for the most exciting moment tonight-let's welcome our defending champion from last month, Daniel Flynn!"

Everyone turned to where the ref pointed.
0

A tall figure in a black robe with a hood strode toward the ring.

He placed one hand on the edge, leaped up with ease, and landed smoothly.

When he threw back the hood, a rough, scarred face came into view-his left cheek marked by a long gash.

His eyes were fierce, like he was about to break someone in half.

The big guy who had just won was still putting on a bold front, but the nervous twitch at his brow gave him away. Daniel shrugged off his robe and tossed it into the crowd, setting off a frenzy among some over-the-top rich women.

"He's oozing manliness!"

"Built like that? Bet he's built in other ways too!"

"Let's just split him for the night!"

"I call dibs! 1 want him all to myself!"

"Those pecs! I'm losing my mind!"

Megan shot a glance at the drooling group of cougars and rolled her eyes hard.

They acted all graceful in public, but behind closed doors, they were no better than beasts.

She'd seen enough gossip online-rich women getting handsy with male models, even accidentally kiling one from overuse.

Rich folks played way dirtier than most could imagine-anything goes if the wallet's thick enough.

As Megan was silently judging them, the light before her dimmed.

A large hand, its joints well-defined, blocked her line of sight.

Tristan leaned close, voice low beside her ear, "Stop watching those guys. Look at me-your man's got a better body anyway."
###Chapter 39 Not the Villain-Just a Pawn


Throughout the entire match, all she could hear were cries of pain, the crunch of bones snapping,and heavy thuds hitting the floor.

Eventually, it was drowned out by the roars of the crowd and the shrill screams of the rich ladies in the stands.

She figured that scar-faced guy must've won.

Her vision finally cleared up, and Megan looked up to see the scarred man cloaked in black.

His opponent lay motionless on the ring, blood dripping from his mouth and pooling around him. His chest wasn't moving at all.

Yeah...he was gone.

"They signed a death waiver before the fight,"Tristan explained to Megan. "Whatever happens in the ring,the arena doesn't take responsibility. People's lives here? Might as well be dust."

At that moment, the referee raised the scar-faced guy's arm and yelled, "Tonight's champion is Daniel Flynn!"

But Daniel didn't look the least bit proud-he seemed totally out of it.

No speech, no pose-he stepped off the stage and made straight for the locker room.

Tristan got up, still holding Megan's hand."Come on, let's go catch ourselves a rat."

Wading through the packed crowd, they headed backstage toward the locker rooms.

Oddly, no one stopped them the whole way.

Megan gave Tristan's big hand a squeeze. "Babe, doesn't this seem a little too easy? Something's off."

Tristan gave her a half-smile. "Silly girl, you didn't actually think it was just the two of us here for this, did ###Chapter 39 Not the Villain-Just a Pawn

Tristan gave her a half-smile. "Silly girl, you didn't actually think it was just the two of us here for this, did Megan shot a proud look at Tristan and raised her eyebrow. "Guys like this? Gotta be fast, fierce, and direct.
Hit where it counts when they least expect it!"

Tristan let out a low chuckle as he took the gun. "Break 'em if you want-but only mine's off-limits."

Megan's smile stiffened. What the heck was that supposed to mean?! Total wild move.

Meanwhile, Daniel watched the two flirt as though he wasn't even there-like he was just some half-dead extra.Before anyone could react, Daniel gritted his teeth against the pain and yanked a knife from his waistband, lunging it straight at Megan.

A gunshot tore through the air.

The knife clattered to the ground.

Smoke curled up from the hot barrel as blood suddenly began dripping from a gaping hole in Daniel's left hand.

Tristan's face was cold as ice, his eyes burning with deadly intent.

He yanked Daniel up by the hair and dragged him into the locker room without saying a word.

Megan had never seen this side of Tristan-ruthless, terrifying. Her mind flashed back to their previous life:back when he found her in prison, when he burnt Wyatt and Molly to ash. Probably looked just like this-like death itself.

Too bad she hadn't been able to see it clearly then.

She scanned around cautiously, made sure no one else was watching, and followed them in, locking the door behind her.

Tristan hauled Daniel in front of a bench and sat down with an unsettling calm, spinning the pistol in his hand like he had all the time in the world.

Megan stepped up right next to him.

"Who the hell are you?! I've got no beef with you!" Daniel, now cowering on the ground, had none of the ferocity he'd shown on the ring. He looked pitiful.

As soon as Tristan took off his cap, Daniel's pupils contracted hard.

His voice trembled. "Y-You're Tristan Reid?"

Tristan stared him down, eyes like blades. "Who told you to kidnap Chloe Shaw?"

Daniel froze, then looked away, brow tightly furrowed. "I don't know what you're talking about."

Tristan stopped playing with the gun and leahed in, pressing the muzzle right between Daniel's brows."Ending you would be easier than stepping on a bug."

Daniel didn't flinch. He shoved his head forward against the barrel, jaw clenched, like he was already ready to die.

Then Tristan suddenly pulled back, tucking the gun away. "I'll help you get your daughter back. But you're gonna testify."

Daniel blinked,stunned. He looked up at Tristan with disbelief, something like hope flickering in his tired eyes. "You. you'll help me save my daughter?"

Megan was confused now. Daughter?

Tristan straightened up, composed as ever-calm and collected, like a king on his throne.

He said slowly, "Daniel Flynn. Thirty-seven. His daughter has leukemia and is being treated at Benevita Hospital. Three days ago she was kidnapped. The people behind it made him snatch Chloe and take her to Prestige Club. Someone was supposed to pick her up there."

Daniel crawled forward on the floor. "I don't even know who took her! She's just six, and she's right in the middle of treatment. If she misses her meds now, she'll die! Please, Mr. Reid, I'm begging you-just save my girl. I'll do anything. Anything you ask."

Megan finally got it. Daniel wasn't the mastermind-he was forced into this because someone had his daughter.He was both a victim and a pawn. She wasn't the kind of person to hand out forgiveness easily, but that little girl? She was innocent.

He probably took the underground match fo the prize money-to pay for her treatment.

"We're only after whoever's really behind all this," Megan said coldly."If you help us testify in court,we'll cover your daughter's medical expenses."

Daniel turned to look at her, eyes glassy, already knowing that testifying would likely land him in prison. But what could possibly matter more than his daughter's life?

With Tristan on his side, there was hope again.

"I'Il do it," he said without hesitation. "Whatever it takes for my girl."

That's when the locker room door suddenly burst open with a bang.
 ###Chapter 40 Hug Mode Off,Murder Mode On


The locker room door was kicked open with a bang, slamming into the wall.

Leading the group was a greasy-looking middle-aged man who had to be over two hundred pounds,flanked by a bunch of thugs, all looking ready to throw down.

But the second he spotted the man sitting casually on the bench, that fierce look on his face disappeared like magic, replaced by a fawning grin.

"Well, if it isn't Mr. Reid?" he sneered at Daniel lying on the floor. "No idea what this loserdid to tick you off."

Tristan calmly pulled a wet wipe from his pocket and wiped his fingers one by one, slow and methodical.

After a moment, done withhis little cleanup ritual, he got to his feet. "Daniel's coming with me."

Victor Hayes bared his stained teeth in a forced grin. "You know I'm running this whole underground ring on that guy,right? Without him, business is gonna tank."

Tristan gave a sudden smile-cold and sharp. "No one bargains with me.Ever."

Victor's eyes darted around as he smirked slyly. "But imagine this-word gets out that the famous Tristan died in my ring. Don't you think 'Victor Hayes' would be the name on everyone's lips?" He let out a cocky laugh-until he didn't.

"Keep dreaming," Megan snapped, whipping a little device out of her pocket and tossing it toward the guy.

Nova Tech arched through the air, tail glowing. A series of thin steel needles shot out mid-flight, piercing straight into Victor's open mouth.

His laughter died in an instant. Clutching at his throat, mouth gushing blood, he collapsed backward.

Nova Tech landed neatly and scurried back, pawing at Megan's pants leg. "Nova's scared! That ugly dude almost made me barf! Hug hug!" Megan knelt and scooped the littlebot up, then casually hurled it back toward the thugs behind Victor.

The thugs shrank back, shielding their faces, but nothing came at them. Nova Tech simply dropped two shiny little metal pellets during its landing and zipped back to Megan's side for comfort.

Seeing no danger, the goons let down their guard.

Bad move.

The pellets exploded into spinning rings of razor-thin blades that zipped around their ankles.

Screams erupted as the tough guys dropped like dominoes, clutching their legs and howling in pain.

Tristan grabbed Nova Tech."Nice job."

Two tiny red hearts lit up in its eyes. "Master is the best, the most handsome!"

Megan rolled her eyes and stuffed it back in her pocket.

That's when one of the thugs pulled a gun and aimed it at them.

In a flash, Tristan stepped in front of Megan and fired.

Right then, the side window shattered-followed by that unmistakable splat of bullet hitting flesh.

Headshot.Twice.One to the temple, one between the eyes.

The guy dropped instantly.

Seconds later, a squad of armed operatives in full tactical gear stormed in, guns raised, securing the room and surrounding the fallen men.

Megan grabbed Tristan, checking him over. Her nose stung, heart thumping as she threw herself into hi arms. "You idiot, why'd you take the bullet for me?"

He gently pulled her close, fingertips brushing through her hair. "It's my job to keep you safe."

Megan shook her head furiously. "No. I want to protect you too." She looked up at him, her voice soft but steady. "You could've just walked in and taken him out, couldn't you?"

"Yeah."

"I didn't think it'd get this bad," she muttered with a frown. "They actually had guns."

Tristan's gaze was warm, indulgent. "Well, you wanted to see how we do things, right? It'd be no fun just handing the guy over to you. You needed a little taste of the real thing."

Megan pouted. "Great. Guess I really am the drama."Tristan noticed Megan's eyes were getting red, and he pulled her into his arms, holding her tight. "Of course not. You're everything to me."

Soon,everyone, including Daniel, was taken out of the locker room.

Megan asked with curiosity, "Who was that sniper? That shot was solid!"

Tristan gave a sly grin, eyeing a leg stepping into the room, and quipped, "Cameron, Ice Cam!"

The leg instantly retracted.

Cameron wiped his face, feeling seriously attacked. Dang, that hurt.

Not only did she roast him with a nickname, she practically joked about the boss's life. If his hand had slipped just a little today, one of those thugs could've shot Tristan to pieces.

At Prestige Club.

Daniel had been relocated to an underground room. Max treated and bandaged his gunshot wound.

Once done,Daniel reached out to the number he was instructed to call.

"I want to hear my daughter's voice."

A voice altered by a modulator came through. "And what if you do? Follow instructions and you might see her again."

Daniel snapped, "How do I know you haven't hurt her?" The voice responded, "Fine,hear for yourself."

"Daddy... Daddy... help me..." Little Myra's crying voice cracked through the line, and Daniel's eyes turned red.

"Don't hurt her. I'll do whatever you want."

"Mess up, and you can bury her yourself."

The call ended.

Tristan and Megan sat across from Kevin. Tristan asked, "Any news?"

Dracopower was a key telecom partner, with access to sensitive data-including SkyEye surveillance.

Kevin nodded, "An abandoned steel plant on the west side of the capital."

Tristan turned to Cameron. "Get the girl out safely. And bring back whoever made that call."

"Got it!" Cameron responded right away.

"I'm going with you," Kevin added before heading out with him.

Then Tristan stood and gently pulled Megan to her feet, wrapping an arm around her waist. "Let's go."

Megan nodded in agreement.

As they reached the exit, Tristan looked back at Daniel and said, "We'll bring your daughter here so you can see her first. She'll be taken to the hospital after that. And keep in mind- the guy who called might not be the one pulling the strings. So when you're locked up with him, don't go overboard."

Basically, beat him up if you must, but don't kill him.

Daniel gave a short nod. "Understood."

Tristan and Megan entered another basement room. A skinny man sat in the corner fast asleep, hugging a laptop bag.

As footsteps approached, he jerked awake and scanned the two with panic in his eyes.
"You.you're Tristan?"

Despair flooded his face. "Why me? Why'd I have to piss off the nightmare boss himself?"

Tristan and Megan flopped onto the sofa. He leaned back lazily with one leg casually crossed over the other,tapping his fingers on the armrest.

"He was just about to hop a flight to Thailand when my guys caught him."

Megan rubbed her chin, blinking with interest. "Trying to flee. or maybe go full ladyboy?"

Tristan smirked, "Don't tempt me. That's actually an idea- snip him, send him back."

The man shook his head like mad. "No, no,please! Have mercy!"

"Talk on your own, or we'll make you."
###Chapter 41 Two Peas in a Messed-Up Pod
Hearing Tristan's words, the guy holding the laptop shuffled on his knees till he was about two meters in front of them. "If I come clean, can I get a lighter deal? I'll tell you everything."

Tristan smirked, a touch of menace in his grin. "You think you're in any position to bargain with me?"

The man flopped straight onto his knees, his face drained of all hope. "What bad karma did I get hit with.But hey, if I help you find the real culprit, does that count as redemption?"

While talking, he quickly pulled out his laptop from the bag and powered it up.

"I recorded and downloaded the conversation I had with that person. But they used some mechanical voice changer. I can't crack it."

The audio clip popped up on the screen.

Female voice: "One million, get rid of all the footage from Capitol City for the past three months. Cash only.Pick up at the fourth support of Pegasus Bridge."

Male voice: "I'll get the money first, then delete everything."

Female voice: "You better be quick! I want it wiped so  hard no one can ever recover it!"


Male voice: "Don't worry. Not even Hacker God or Blackwing could recover it. I'm that good."

Female voice: "You sureit's gone?"

Male voice: "Absolutely. No way to bring it back."

The guy scratched his head awkwardly. "I can't uncover the original voice, but if you can get Hacker God or Blackwing on it, they probably can."

Tristan and Megan exchanged smiles-finally,a lead.

It wasn't enough to nail someone just yet, but every piece helped.

Now they just had to dig further into the kidnapping of Daniel's daughter.

Megan chuckled. "Someone's a bit full of themselves,huh? Earlier you were bragging that even Hacker God and Blackwing couldn't undo your deletion."

The guy sniffled, giving a sheepish laugh. "I had to act cocky, right? Otherwise, why would they trust me?"

Megan rubbed her chin. "I'm just wondering.how'd she even find you?"

He pouted a little. "Well, I'm kinda a big deal online.I go by the name Wing God. Been a huge fan of Hacker God and Blackwing, so I mashed up their names into mine. It's got a cool vibe, you know?Guess she couldn't reach the real pros, so she settled for me."


Suddenly, the guy asked, "Can I ask who sent her to me?"


Tristan chuckled lowly. "Blackwing."

The guy slammed his palm to his forehead. "Great. I messed with the Grim Reaper himself."

Megan smiled. "Good that you get it. You've got a shot at redemption though-testify when the time comes, and you're off the hook."

The guy looked like he'd just dodged a bullet. He kept thanking them, like he was ready to start praying to heaven and every deity he could think of.

Megan raised her brows. If he found out she was Blackwing. he'd probably want to strangle her.

Tristan glanced at his watch-it was already eleven at night. "Let's go."

He pulled Megan up from the couch and into his arms.

The man handed over the laptop bag with both hands,eager to please.

Leaving Prestige Club,Tristan drove Megan straight to Dreamscape Manor.

"That Molly is a piece of work."

Tristan's hand clenched tighter around hers. "Don't worry.Justice might take its time, but it never forgets."

Then he added, "Wyatt's been staying at Benevita Hospital. That little girl'sthere,too. I'm betting Daniel got targeted back then."

Megan narrowed her eyes. "Both of them are dirty. No  way they're not involved."

Tristan gave her a meaningful glance. "You already knew they had something shady going on?"

Megan almost answered, "From my past life." But nope,couldn't say that.

So she shrugged. "Nope. Just think they kind of suit each other."


"Suits each other?"


"Two peas in a messed-up pod- They deserve each other!"


Tristan let out a low chuckle. "I've looked into Wyatt before.He and Molly meet up at fancy hotels all the time."


Megan sighed in her heart. Of course they were messing around back then-she was just the fool who had no clue. Worse, she ended up being their weapon,hurting the one who loved her most.

Not this time. She wasn't letting either of them off the hook.

Tristan noticed the guilt flicker in her eyes. "What's wrong?"

"Nothing. Just wondering how I ever bought Molly's act."

"You've got good eyes. After all, you picked a good guy."

Megan felt a stab of shame. Her so-called 'good judgment' had come at a steep price-paid in betrayal  and lessons burned into her bones.


She buried her face in his arm, mumbling,"Well,my hubby's the best guy in the world."

Tristan glanced down at her, eyes full of affection.





Back at their Dreamscape Manor, Tristan got a call from Cameron.


Daniel's daughter was fine. After reuniting at Prestige Club with her dad, she was quickly taken to a hospital specializing in blood disorders, guarded around the clock.


Turns out the kidnapper wasn't even the mastermind -just some hired puppet paid to take the fall. Every call he got from the real culprit came from fake,untraceable numbers. No recordings, no backups.Nothing. Huge difference between him and that hacker-real pros always leave themselves a way out.

Later, after washing up, Tristan brought Megan to the study.

She plopped down on his strong legs and watched him fire up his laptop and dive into the dark web. He messaged the Hacker God.

Tristan: [Can you restore a modified voice recording?]

Hacker God: [Sure. 2 million. Delivered tomorrow.]

Tristan: [Deal. Cash for goods.]

Hacker God: [Agreed.]

  Tristan sent the file. Once it was received, the other party logged off.

Megan clicked her tongue. "Two mil? That's steep!"

Tristan tapped her nose. "Worth every cent."

Resting her head against his neck, she rolled her eyes.Worth it? Yeah, right.

Just as she was mentally mourning the blown cash,Tristan scooped her up and gave her a little toss."Alright, time to rock my baby girl to sleep!"

"Oh please! Just admit it-you're the one who wants that!"


His voice was deep and smooth, like a cello. "You're all talk, no truth,sweetheart."


·..

Moonlight slipped in through the curtains, soft and silver. The only sound in the room was steady,peaceful breathing.

Suddenly,those sly fox-like eyes shot open.

Megan gently moved the arm wrapped around her waist, carefully slipping out from under the covers.Barefoot, laptop in hand, she crept into the walk-in closet.


She quietly shut the door behind her and settled on the soft carpet, laptop on her knees.

Her pale fingers danced across the keyboard. Within moments, she'd broken into the dark web and slipped right through Hacker God's firewall, grabbing his file  like taking candy from a baby.

She sent him a creepy little smiley face and a line: [Forever the runner-up(·'~'·)]

After logging out, she focused on restoring the warped voice clip.

If it was altered with a voice modulator, all she had to do was reverse the process-switch inputs and outputs -and boom, original voice retrieved. But if it had been mechanically distorted, like using some weird external tool, that'd be almost impossible to undo. No way to match the distortion strength or calibrate the sensitive variances of the device.

That's why that hack calling himself Wing God couldn't crack it.


As the audio neared full restoration, a smug smile tugged at the corner of her lips.

Then, suddenly-she sensed a figure standing behind her...
###Chapter 42 Blackwing in Bed
Megan suddenly spun around, having sensed a pair of eyes on her back.

What met her gaze first were a pair of long legs,followed by a narrow waist and broad shoulders.

Her eyes slowly traveled up to meet that devilishly handsome face,and her smile froze on her lips. She momentarily forgot to breathe.

She blinked. "Hey there, honey..."

The next second, her "honey" scooped her up like she was a kitten, carrying her straight back to the room.

The "kitten" now knelt on the soft bed, twisting her fingers nervously in her lap.

Tristan sat at the edge, pointing to the screen with an alert saying [Recovered].

"WelI, color me surprised. You've been holding out on me."


Megan gave a sweet grin. "Oh come on, it was just a fluke!"


Tristan tilted her chin up. "A hacker, huh?"

"Nah, not really!" She grabbed his elegant fingers,slowly guiding them down in an attempt to distract him from the conversation.  As his hand brushed her porcelain-like neck, he swallowed hard, throat bobbing visibly.

He quickly pulled his hand back. "You took down Hacker God. That's not something just anyone can do."

Megan leaned in, the black lace strap of her camisole dipping enough to show a teasing glimpse of her curves. "Babe... I'm sleepy. Can we crash already? I've got class tomorrow."

Tristan poked her forehead,lightly pushing her back."Codename."

She scooted back on her knees, throwing both hands above her head like surrendering."Okay,okay-but no smacking me!"

His eyes narrowed. There was only one hacker he'd truly wanted to wring the neck of-the one who stole two hundred million from his company.

He snorted coldly. "Blackwing. That's you?"

Megan let out a sheepish laugh. "Surprised? Delighted?"

Tristan pulled himself up onto the bed, palms pressing down near her as he leaned in. "So, how are you going to make up for that two hundred million you took from me?"


Face-to-face with him, Megan tugged at his firm chest. "Didn't I help you save ten mil once? Another two mil this time-come on, I'm working on it."

The words had barely left her mouth before he was on top of her. He brushed his lips down to her ear, giving the lobe a playful nip. "Let's call this collecting some interest."


Then he covered her lips with his, filling the room with nothing but the sound of heated kisses...

As golden sunlight broke softly through the clouds at dawn,Megan rolled over and cuddled into a warm chest.

His hand slipped along her waist under the covers, his husky morning voice brushing against her ear. "Megs,time to wake up."

With a smile tugging at her lips, Megan opened one eye, letting her fingers wander down his sculpted chest before pinching the defined line of his waist.

She huffed. "See what you did? My arms are all bruised!"

She hooked her legs around his waist, grinning. "Well?Come at me,then!"

Tristan squinted at her with a smirk, clearly seeing through her little provocation.

He ground his teeth lightly. "You really think I won't?""Pfft. If you've got the guts, go for it!"

And with that, she teasingly nipped at his Adam's apple.

He nuzzled into her neck, breathing in her light scent."You know what they say?"


"What?" "Hard bite, funeral.Soft bite. and there might be one more of me."


He flashed her a grin. "So, what's it gonna be,Meg?"

She looked him dead in the eyes, bit her lip, and smirked.


"Soft bite sounds good."Tristan took a deep breath,then bit down hard on Megan's collarbone before flipping off the bed. "I'll hold it in!"

Watching him storm out ofthe room, Megan sat up abruptly-yep, off to take another cold shower.

She sighed. Seriously, why wait until her birthday-aka their wedding day?

They already signed the papers! This guy had to be obsessing again. So damn stubborn for nothing!

Rolling around on the bed with the blanket wrapped around her, she was totally frustrated.

"Thud!"


Still cocooned in the quilt, she crashed to the floor.Lucky there was a carpet, but she still landed face-first.


"Ahhh!"


Seconds later, Tristan burst in.


He took one look at her bundle-of-a-self on the floor and frowned. "Why are you on the ground?"

She slowly raised her head and grinned. "I'm doing some role-playing." With his long legs, Tristan strolled over. His broad shoulders and narrow waist were on full display, with just a towel wrapped at the waist.

He scooped her up and smirked. "What are you playing?"

Megan chuckled, "Nah, a... maggot. One from the bathroom!"


Tristan looked at the adorable mess in his arms, gently set her back on the bed, then rolled with her under the covers. "Alright, maggot-go to the bathroom and wash up already."

She pursed her lips, but her eyes flicked to his towel.

Eyebrows lifted, she started humming in a sing-song voice: "Twinkle twinkle, magic wand, makes big things bigger with just one arm~"

Then she sprang out of bed and pranced to the bathroom.


Tristan's mouth twitched. That song. definitely not rated G.


Meanwhile, in a dim room across the house-

Samuel was brushing his teeth while heading toward the window. He pulled open the grey curtains.

Morning sunlight spilled in. The weather was nice, and his mood? Even better.

After all, making two hundred grand in one night wasn't bad at all, even if he wasn't short on cash.

He sat down at the desk and flipped open the laptop. The toothbrush paused mid-air.

What the hell?


He'd been sniped again?!

That damn Blackwing even left a message calling him "Forever the runner-up."

It was straight-up savage.

Fuming,Samuel swallowed a mouthful of toothpaste and slammed his toothbrush against the table.

"Damn you, Blackwing! If I ever catch you-you're so dead!"

Slumping into his chair, he squinted his foxy eyes.Time to dig into that girl-see if she had any ties to Blackwing.

Forgetting all about the hacker god, both he and Megan finished breakfast and drove out of Dreamscape Manor separately.

Megan glanced into her rearview mirror and saw Tristan's car following close behind. Her heart warmed with happiness.

When she reached the gates of Meridian University,Tristan finally turned off.

She peered into the mirror-to see a cheerful figure bounding toward her car and popping open the passenger door.

Rachel beamed."Morning,sis-in-law!"

Megan started the engine and glanced over as they pulled out. "Everything cool with your aunt?"

"Yup,all good. Don't worry."

"| ran into Natalie yesterday. We've got a shared lecture today."

Rachel shrugged. "She already knows I'm dating Kai.She saw us together at a Michelin restaurant in France six months ago."

Megan gave her a side-eye. "What, you scared now?"

"Please! Kai's my man!" Rachel gave a friendly pat to Megan's flat chest.

Megan chuckled, "So Kai's not really into... the dairy section?"

Rachel peeked down, then smacked her lightly with a fist. "You're the worst, Megan!"

"Hahaha..."

###Chapter 43 Game On,Courtesy of...
The car came to a smooth stop in front of the main building. Megan and Rachel stepped out together.

At Meridian University, students might confuse Einstein with Edison,but no one could fail to recognize Megan.She was basically the plus-one of Tristan by now,and that came with serious street cred. No one dared cross her.


People actually made detours just to avoid walking too close, like they were afraid they'd somehow offend her just by existing-like breathing near her could get them KO'd.

They walked into the classroom and, like clockwork,Rachel tugged Megan toward the back row and plopped down next to her, already grinning.

"That back-of-the-room view... truly the underrated art of admiring hairstyles," she joked.

Megan gave her a helpless look. Trust Rachel to turn slacking into something artsy.

That's when a high-pitched, over-the-top laugh echoed through the room like someone had set off a ringtone from hell.

Enter stage left: Natalie and Amelia. The second Natalie spotted the two in the back row,her mocking laugh came to a screeching halt-as if destiny itself had just yanked her pause button.

Her face stiffened, and her eyes were practically laser beams of venom. If looks could kill, Megan and Rachel would've been toast.


Natalie and Amelia sat midway down the room. Natalie pulled out a bottle of firetruck-red nail polish and started brushing it on like it was war paint.

She didn't bother lowering her voice either. While carefully applying the polish, she launched into drama -queen mode.

"Some people really have no shame. Getting cozy with someone who's already taken? That's gnawing on leftovers, plain and simple," she sneered. "Birds of a feather,huh."

Rachel's fists clenched at her side, her face going red from anger. She didn't need subtitles to know Natalie was taking shots at her.

Megan, on the other hand, just coolly reached into her bag and pulled out a robotic dog. Holding it uplike a prized accessory, she pointed toward the front.

"Nova, do you see that girl with the neon green hair?"

Nova's mechanical head tilted as it followed Megan's finger. Except... that "green" hair was clearly purple.

But Nova, being a crowd-pleaser, nodded anyway."Nova sees it! It's ridiculously green!"  Rachel choked on her laughter. Was this robot colorblind or just shady?

"Is... is that for real?" she whispered, eyes wide.

Megan raised a perfectly arched brow and smirked."Gift from my honey. Green with envy yet?"

Then she leaned down and whispered to Nova,"I think that green mess would make a great doggie toilet.You know what to do."


Nova gave a pretend shake-no real fur, just dramatic flair. Then with a mighty leap, it shouted, "Doggo taking off!"

The robotic pup nosedived straight onto Natalie's perfectly styled hair and began an intense doggy paddle routine. To finish it off, it "accidentally"dripped two thick blobs of motor oil.

Natalie freaked out instantly-nail brush hit the floor,the polish spilled, and she almost fell over her own desk.


"WHAT IS THAT?! Somebody help!" she screamed,swatting at the dog like she was in a horror movie.

Nova zipped back to Megan's side and dramatically trembled. "Nova scared! That monster was too ugly to process! Hold me, Goddess!"

Rachel's jaw practically hit the floor.

Natalie looked like she'd just been attacked by a glitter bomb. Her hair was a disaster, her face and hands smeared red from the polish.She spun around, eyebrows twitching, and shot daggers at Megan and Rachel. "You two are way outta line!"


Megan casually tucked Nova back into her bag, her smile sweet and eyes glinting. "What can I say? You were polluting the air with your garbage talk-l did everyone a favor."

Natalie jabbed a painted finger her way."Think being Tristan's woman makes you queen of the world?People aren't blind, you know!"

"Heh." Megan scoffed, lips curled with disdain."lf |actually did whatever | wanted, you'd be six feet under-with daisies growing on your face."

"You-!"


Megan leaned lazily against her chair, arms crossed casually. "Cut the crap about who's the homewrecker.You two just wrecked a perfectly good couple for fun.Women like you? Doesn't matter who you marry-your man's gonna have a 'main' at home and side chicks everywhere. Also, that neon green hair? Real on-theme choice."


Natalie stomped her foot in frustration, too mad to get a single word out.

Right then, the teacher walked in. Natalie ground her teeth, breathing heavily like she was about to explode.

She threw a glance at Amelia beside her. "Ugh...Amelia, help me fix my hair." Amelia let out a gentle sigh, then reached over to smooth Natalie's hair a bit.

For the entire class, Rachel was practically starry-eyed watching Megan. Girl's got a mouth sharper than broken glass, and honestly? She loved it.

At the end of class, the teacher adjusted his glasses and addressed the room. "Hold on before leaving,everyone. There's an upcoming national fashion and jewelry design competition this September. First prize gets to work with the national heartthrob Jason, and the winning outfit will appear in his next movie. Don't miss your shot to meet a legend up close!"

The announcement instantly got the class buzzing with excitement-everyone except Megan and Rachel.

Rachel leaned over. "You in?"

Megan gave a little shrug. "Meh, not really. Taken woman and all that."


She started packing her stuff, casually heading for the door.


"Tch, what else would we expect?" Natalie sneered."One's a transfer, the other took a gap year. No wonder they're too chicken to join. Honestly, saves them from a total embarrassment."


Megan suddenly stopped mid-step, walked back up to the podium, and swooped a sign-up sheet right from the teacher's hand.

She scribbled in her info at lightning speed, then  turned around with a dazzling grin.

"Really, I was gonna sit this one out. Thought I'd give y'all a fighting chance, you know? 'Cause once I'm in,it's game over for everyone else. But since Natalie's begging for me to crush the competition, guess I'll do her a favor. No hard feelings, okay? When it's all said and done, just direct your resentment her way."

Rachel, who'd been all fired up to join, instantly chickened out after that. This was beyond her pay grade. She glanced at Megan strutting out like she owned the place, then quickly hurried after her.

As they reached the door, Rachel looked back at Natalie. "By the way. your hair's still green. Painfully green."

Fuming at the insult from someone she saw as 'the other woman,' Natalie clenched her fists so tight her nails left marks in her palms.


Amelia let out a soft, amused chuckle. "Nat,what's the point in getting pissed? As long as she's around,you'll always be second best."

Natalie nodded sharply. "Exactly. That's why I have to win this.I need to prove I'm the real deal."

She got up and marched straight to the podium,grabbing a form and filling it out without hesitation.

Amelia's smile vanished instantly, her eyes narrowing with sarcasm. This idiot finally understood something?That's a first.  Outside the building, Megan and Rachel ran into Samuel, who looked fresh, upbeat, and like he just walked out of a magazine shoot.

He flashed a winning smile and waved. "Hey, Megan!"

Rachel nudged Megan's arm."Uh. who's that?"

Megan smirked, eyes twinkling. "Sam the Sham."
###Chapter 44 You Test Me,I Test You Back
Hearing Megan's teasing tone, Rachel couldn't help but click her tongue.

That nickname...why did it sound so flirty?

If Tristan ever caught wind of it, he'd definitely turn into a jealous maniac.

"Hey,Meg,you two that close or what?"

Megan shot her a side glance, already guessing Rachel's brain had gone somewhere else. She clarified,"His name's Samuel Lewis."


Rachel instantly got it.

Okay, that name did sound kind of epic-bold,memorable,hard to forget.

Samuel strolled over. "Megan,grab lunch with me?"

Megan calmly raised her hand, showing off the ring on her ring finger. "Sorry, this married lady doesn't do lunch dates with other men. Got it?"


Samuel just shrugged. "Well, I did kind of save your life yesterday. Like, that counts for something,doesn't it? Isn't there some saying about paying back a life-saving favor tenfold?"
 
Megan went silent. Yeah, right-like she owed him anything Rachel,who already knew what went down yesterday,was surprised. "Wait, this tall dude's the one who saved you?"

Megan gave her a glare. "You're not exactly helping here."


She exhaled slowly. "Let's just meet at that café right outside campus."

Samuel's smile twitched, thinking: Seriously? You scammed me out of 27 million, and we're settling this over some campus café? Real generous.

The three of them ended up at Knight Café, just off campus.

Samuel took a sip of his lemon water. "I just rolled out a new game, kind of geared toward women. Thing is,I don't really have many female friends, so I thought maybe you'd want to try it out, Megan."

Megan raised a brow. "Pretty sure we're not exactly friends. And if you're doing market research, plenty of girls would probably jump in."

Samuel brushed his fringe back. "Yeah, but they like my looks, not my genius. So I know they're just sweet -talking me."

Megan:[ Seriously, is there any humility in that brain?]

Rachel:[Gotta admit, loving that weird self-confidence a bit.]

Samuel handed over a USB stick to Megan. "Figured you'd have your laptop, since you're into design and  all. I didn't bring mine-shoulder's sore from dodging that knife yesterday. Carrying stuff kinda hurts right now."

Rachel: "Wait. You carried her?"

Megan shot Samuel an icy look, then turned to Rachel "He tweaked his shoulder, sure, but he's also got a twisted tongue. Don't take him seriously."

Rolling her eyes, she took the USB and opened her laptop to plug it in.

The game started downloading. Then she gave the USB back to Samuel.

Opening the game, she saw it was set in a classic high -fantasy world-think dragons, ancient runes, and spell -wielding warriors.

Visually, the game was stunning. The animation,effects, character designs, and outfits were all next-level.


She started customizing her character and picking out some seriously cool gear.

Rachel was instantly hooked, eyes wide with curiosity as she leaned in closer.

Samuel sat nearby, calm and composed, a faintly amused smile tugging at his lips as he watched the two girls geek out.

Megan's brows slowly drew together-something was off. There was definitely a virus planted in that game software.  "Ouch," she suddenly exclaimed, grabbing the laptop as she stood up and pointed toward the restroom "Stomach's acting up out of nowhere, gonna dash to the bathroom. I'm taking this gem with me,can't stop playing."

As she rounded the corner, she bumped right into the Four-Eyes guy.

A light bulb went off in her head, and she quickly called out to him.

She had him hide in the emergency stairwell,while she ducked into a bathroom stall.

Her fingertips flew across the keyboard-the virus had some sort of money-stealing program built in. It wasn't as lethal as what she'd created before, but it was enough to wreck her firewall.

She clenched her jaw-someone clearly wanted payback.



In under five minutes, she wiped the virus and reinforced the firewall.

Walking out, she waved the Four-Eyes over. "In a sec,just play along with whatever I say, got it?"

Four-Eyes adjusted his specs and nodded. "Got it."

Megan gave a slight smirk. "You know the saying-when someone saves your life..."

Four-Eyes instantly chimed in, "You owe them yours.."

She shot him a look. "Let's go."

Back in the main seating area, Samuel and Rachel were deep in cheerful conversation.

Megan returned with Four-Eyes and slid into her seat.

She put on a startled look. "Geez, there was a freaking virus in your software! Good thing I ran into Four-Eyes,or all my coins in that account would've disappeared."

Samuel narrowed his fox-like eyes with a trace of suspicion. "You're saying he cracked the virus?"

Feeling her foot stomp on his, Four-Eyes instantly replied, "Oh yeah, piece of cake. Nothing big."

Samuel rubbed his chin, mulling it over. "You two seem pretty close,huh."

Four-Eyes sneaked a quick glance at Megan. "Uh,yeah,you could say that."

Megan glanced at her watch. "I've got something else to deal with, so I'll head out. You two keep chatting."

With a quick motion, she and Rachel slipped off.

Hot sweat was already dripping down Four-Eyes 'forehead. The way Samuel carried himself had him seriously on edge-nervous and overwhelmed.

Giving a small nod, he also began to stand.

But then Samuel uncrossed his legs,leaned in slightly,and his voice dropped, eyes turning sharp. "Let's have a little chat."





Rachel looked confused. "Wait, what just happened?"

Megan smirked, a playful glint flickering in her eyes.  "Samuel's game came with a built-in virus. Lucky for me,I ran into Four-Eyes-he helped me clean it out. I'm guessing Samuel and Four-Eyes are deep in conversation about how that whole thing went down right about now."

She was almost sure now-Samuel had started growing suspicious. The whole meeting today was probably just to confirm his hunch.

Still, that just showed he wasn't easy to fool.

"Sorry, Four-Eyes," she thought, "but I had no choice but to use you as cover."

Rachel nodded lightly. "What's his name again? Didn't you guys go to school together?"

Megan blinked innocently. "Barely. I left for France for an exchange program not long after we met. So.I actually never got his name."

Four-Eyes:[Guess I'm just Nameless Extra #1.]

"Oh, by the way, Rachel, I'm heading to the hospital to see Grandpa. After that, I'll meet up with Tristan.There's a charity auction tonight."

Rachel's eyes lit up like fireworks. "I'm coming with!Pick me up later!"

She said it and literally bolted off toward the Vuijing Bay villa.

Megan let out a tiny laugh,helpless but amused, then started the car and headed for Capital Hospital.

She picked up a bouquet of lilies before going up to Room 1123 in the neurology department.

As soon as Bernard saw her, he said, "You were here a few days ago."

Her heart soared-he remembered her!

Grabbing his hand gently, she leaned in. "Grandpa, you recognize me?"

He hesitated, thinking carefully. "You're... you're Megan,right?"

"Yes, Grandpa. It's me. You remembered!"

Bernard frowned slightly, his brows knitting together as he stared at her like trying to pull something from memory. "I feel like. there's something really important I need to tell you. But I can't quite grab onto it... What was it.?”

He rubbed his temple with frustration. "It's just not coming to me."

Megan lightly patted his hand. "It's okay, don't stress over it. Grandpa, the world's top neurosurgeon will be here in mid-September. He'll fix you up. You'll be just fine."


Bernard gave a tiny nod. "I've got a headache.I want to sleep a bit."

Megan, worried he might have another seizure like last time, gently helped him lie down and tucked the blanket around him. "Alright, get some rest."

Soon enough, the old man with silver hair had drifted off peacefully  The male aide stepped in quietly. "Miss Shaw, as soon as you left last time, the other Miss Shaw showed up.The one with the bad temper-nothing like you. I'll go get some hot water. You stay here."

Megan gave a small nod and waited until he'd fully stepped out before swiftly pulling a tiny device out of her handbag.

It was a white, barely noticeable micro surveillance camera.

Only five millimeters in size, but with amazing storage and full-angle coverage-it was known as a "mosquito cam" for a reason.

She stepped carefully onto a chair and fixed it onto the wall,right above the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Right then, the door creaked open behind her.

###Chapter 45 She Heard Everything
Megan turned her head and caught the male nurse staring at her in surprise.

"Miss Shaw, what are you doing?"

Megan gave him a calm smile, lifting the feather duster in her hand. "Just dusting off a bit, no biggie."

Inwardly, she gave herself a mental high five-classic misdirection, worked like a charm.

She hopped off the chair lightly.

Right then, the sound of heels clicked outside the hospital room.

The door swung open and in walked Molly, holding a soft pink bouquet in one hand.

The moment she saw Megan, she flashed a sugary smile. "Oh! So you're here too,Meg."

That voice might sound sweet to others, butto Megan,it was pure nails-on-chalkboard. Her eyes narrowed."He's not even your real grandpa, and his wife's not your real grandma. You seriously think you need to come here pretending to care?"

Molly set the fruit basket on the table and pouted,playing the hurt victim. "We've lived under the same roof for over ten years. Grandpa really means so much to me. You still can't forgive me, Meg? I never meant for things to turn out this way. I really am sorry."

The male nurse's jaw nearly hit the floor. Was this the same woman who last time acted all high and mighty?She was terrifying! Two-faced to the core. All this rich family drama. nope, better stay out of it before he got caught in the crossfire.

Megan couldn't be bothered with Molly anymore. She washed her hands in the bathroom, then sat by the bed and started peeling an apple.

Molly,seeing she was being ignored, forced a smile and said, "Grandpa Reid's birthday banquet is this Saturday. I'm sure you'll be attending too,right?"

Megan glanced up at her in silence for a second."Oh?So you're going too?"

Molly lowered her gaze, giving another soft smile. "I'm going as Wyatt's date."

"Ha." Megan sliced off a piece of apple and popped it into her mouth. "His date or... his bedtime buddy?"

"What are you even saying, Meg?" Molly gripped her purse tightly, clearly stung.

"I'm speaking plain English," Megan deadpanned."If you don't get it, then step out and close the door on your way. I don't want you fake-crying over my grandpa ever again."

Molly's face turned pale, then flushed red. Her lips pressed into a thin line, nails digging into her leather bag.

Still, she forced herself to speak gently. "Alright, then.I'll leave now."

Before she turned, she even swiped at her cheek like wiping away invisible tears.

The moment the door clicked shut, Megan stood up and turned to the nurse. "If she shows up again, or anyone else unfamiliar comes around, I want to be informed immediately. What's your number?"

He rattledit off, and Megan dialed right then and there."Here's mine. Call me first thing if anything's off."The nurse gave a nod. "Got it. Don't worry."

Megan grabbed her bag and headed out of the hospital. On the way, her phone buzzed-Molly was in the middle of a call. Without hesitation, Megan tapped into it.


The voices of Molly and Wyatt came through loud and clear.

Molly said, "I tried to plant the camera at the hospital for evidence, but ran into that bitch unexpectedly."

Wyatt replied, "So it didn't work? Whatever. Just finish her off Saturday night. Then pull the hallway footage -it'll look like Tristan was the one with her. That idiot will totally fall for it."

Molly scoffed, "I haven't told you yet, but ever since she went on that hunger strike, she's totally changed.I can't control her like before."  Wyatt's tone turned cold. "Then we'll make Saturday count. Stir things up between her and Tristan-make sure she hates him. He'll let her do anything she wants anyway."

"I know," Molly said, determined. "This time, it'll work."

"I also got word that the fighter got caught."

"What?"

"Chill. You never contacted him directly, right? Plus the guy handling the girl and the hacker-different numbers, voice changers, the works."

"I did all that, yeah. Still... makes me nervous."

"No loose ends, remember? Just tell him to kill the girl and bury her. Then vanish from the city."

"Okay. Oh, and I've found this drug-any woman takes it and loses all control. Even someone pure and stubborn won't be able to resist. That adopted brat dared to insult me? She's dead meat."

Wyatt chuckled. "As long as you're having fun. Baby,come over already. I've never tried it in a hospital room Can't wait for you to jump me."

"You're awful!" Molly giggled. "I'm on my way."

Listening to them, Megan's eyes darkened with rage.

They didn't even spare a little girl. And now,they planned to drug Rachel too.

Monsters.

In her past life, those two banked on Tristan's love for her-manipulating her to hurt him, using her to steal company secrets. What they didn't expect was that she was the hacker who dealt the final blow.


Even when Tristan found out it was her, he didn't fight back.

If he had pushed back just a little, maybe the company wouldn't have collapsed so thoroughly.

That thought made Megan's gaze ice-cold.

These two? Dream on.

She shut off the tapped call, started the engine, and headed straight to Reid Corporation.

At the same time, Samuel stepped out of the Knight Café and into his sports car.He twirled the flash drive between his fingers, a faint smirk tugging at his lips.

So Megan used Four-Eyes as a cover? Not like the guy sold her out-dude clearly has no clue about programming.

Interesting.

Her connection with Blackwing definitely isn't simple

As long as he sticks with her, he'll eventually trace Blackwing's trail.




Reid Group Headquarters.

A sleek black Maybach drifted into the parking spot with smooth precision.

Megan, carrying a backpack, strode toward the  towering skyscraper, heading straight for the executive elevator.


That's when a receptionist in uniform walked up with a polished smile. "Hello, miss. Who are you here to see?"


Megan curved her lips into a polite smile. "I'm here for Tristan."

The receptionist dipped her head slightly. "Do you have an appointment?"

Megan held up her phone. "Yeah, I do."

Remaining professional, the receptionist nodded."Please come to the front desk to register. I'll get in touch with Assistant Brooks. If you're on the list, we'll take you up."

Megan gave a small nod, cooperating nicely. "Sure."

While she was signing in, another receptionist sashayed over-this one wearing heavy makeup and carrying a steaming cup of coffee.

Her eyes scanned Megan with a full dose of arrogance."Ugh, another gold-digger here for the boss? Girl,have you looked in a mirror? Think you can just climb into his bed looking like that?"

Megan laughed lightly. "It's fine to protect your boss,but trash talk doesn't seem very 'professional'. Is this how employees at Reid Group treat guests?"

The first receptionist looked embarrassed. "I'm so sorry,miss."  With a loud clunk, the flashy receptionist slammed the coffee cup on the desk, some of the hot liquid splashing out.

She snapped, "Why the hell are you apologizing to some random chick trying to sleep her way up?"

The first receptionist frowned,about to call Assistant Brooks, but the other woman reached over and ended the call mid-ring.

Crossing her arms dramatically, she sneered at Megan "Girls like you show up all the time. Save it and get lost. What if the boss actually notices you? Then what -do I just disappear?"

Megan looked at her, who was holding her head high like a queen bee, and calmly dialed Tristan's number.

Before she could hit call, the woman grabbed her wrist. "Look at this! She's actually pretending she knows the CEO. Got some nerve, thinking he'd go for someone like you!"

Megan's patience hit its limit. She yanked her arm back with force.


The woman's eyes widened. "You just hit me?!"

She hissed and immediately grabbed the coffee cup,flinging it straight toward Megan.

###Chapter 46 Mess with the CEO's Wif...

The scalding liquid splashing onto the floor drew sharp gasps from the people nearby.

Megan swiftly dodged, but a few drops still stained the pristine white of her shirt. Her eyes narrowed, that usual fox-like glint now carrying a flash of irritation and a hint of something cold.

She tossed her backpack into the startled arms of the intern at the reception. "Hold this for me. I've got a stray mutt to deal with."

Then she spun around and walked off.

The flamboyant receptionist burst into mocking laughter. "Look at her! What a coward. Left her bag and ran off."

Right then, she saw Megan say something to an old man leaning on a cane across the hall. and the next second, Megan was striding back with that cane in her hand.


The receptionist's smug smile froze. "Wait-what are you doing?! What do you think you're doing?!"

Megan wasn't the type to waste her time on arguing when she could fix things with actions. She raised the cane and pressed it lightly against the receptionist's  chin. "Come out, or I'll flatten all that filler in your jaw."

The woman grabbed the cane tightly. "You wouldn't dare!"


Megan yanked it out of her grip and smacked it down right on her chest. "Boom! Bet your silicone's crying.Next time, maybe don't go cheap."

A sharp scream pierced the air, turning every head in the room.

"She's gonna kill me! Someone help!"

The woman bolted, but Megan coolly stepped in her way. "You messed with the wrong one. Time for some dog-beating stick action!"

"Running your mouth like a market hag? Deserves a hit!"


"Throwing coffee at people? Cold-hearted snake move. Also deserves a hit!"

"Ruining the company's image? Still deserves a hit!"

"Eyeing someone else's man? Oh, that gets an extra hit!"

"That's a lie! I never went after anyone's man!"

Megan delivered a solid smack to her backside."You were drooling over mine! Maybe this'll knock some memory into your skull."

"You hit my butt!"

Megan sniffed, indifferent. "Honestly? Your face and your butt are equally unfortunate, so I don't see a  difference."


The receptionist whimpered, "You're shameless!You're dreaming if you think the President's your husband!"

Megan didn't bother clapping back. When one area got shielded, she just switched it up-arm, then legs,then back to arms. Precision strikes.

Suddenly, the room's energy shifted, sharp and cold

The receptionist froze mid-defensive block, her eyes lighting up like she'd spotted hope in hell. She stumbled away like she'd seen salvation and ran straight toward a tall figure walking over.

Just as she reached out for the immaculate shine of his hand-crafted shoes, Megan swung the cane again,like she was teeing off on a driving range, and whacked her hard from behind.


The receptionist dropped to his feet,ready to grab his shoes and sob her way to safety.

But the man? He stepped back fast.

She looked up with wide, watery eyes. "MMr. Reid, that crazy woman is claiming you're her husband and tried to get into the executive elevator. I know you hate that, so I stopped her. But then she beat me with a cane!"


Tristan's brows pinched together. "Cameron, get her out of my building."

On the floor, the receptionist turned her head and smirked up at Megan. That ugly, smug grin said it all-See? You lose.


But Cameron gave a quick wave, and four bodyguards closed in immediately.

They grabbed her, stretching out her limbs like they were about to ship her off.

"Hey! You've got the wrong person! Kick her out, not me!"

"Mr. Reid, don't do this!"

"Let me go,you morons!"

She was chucked outside without mercy, landing hard at the entrance. Curious onlookers stopped to watch the spectacle.

Still trying to charge back in, she staggered up-

Only to be met by Cameron again. His voice was ice."Do you even realize who you just pissed off?"The gaudy receptionist gritted her teeth. "Just a damn homewrecker trying to cling to Mr. Reid."

Cameron sneered. "She's Mrs. Reid. Boss said it himself-he doesn't want to see you again in the Capitol City. You know what that means."

Mrs.Reid?

The receptionist stood there dumbfounded.When did Tristan get married?

She seriously messed with the wrong person

Whispers rippled through the surrounding crowd of  onlookers.


She suddenly exploded, yelling, "What the hell are y'all staring at? Nothing better to do? Bunch of idiots!"

She limped forward, massaging the bruises on her side.

Then someone called out behind her.

Turning around, she saw her supervisor walking toward her,carrying a box. He tossed it at her feet.

"Thanks to you, my bonus this month just went up in smoke.Of all people, you had to mess with the CEO's wife? If that hot coffee had hit her, you'd be spending the rest of your life behind bars. Ugh-bad luck!"

Without another word, he turned and left.

Meanwhile, inside the building, Tristan was checking Megan carefully from head to toe.

Megan wrapped her arms around his waist. "Babe, I was really scared just now!"

Hold up-who was it chasing that woman with a cane just now?

Megan sniffled. "That coffee came flying at me,all steaming and scary. What if it hit my face? What if I got disfigured? What if you stopped loving me?"

Tristan held her tight. "No matter what you look like,I'll always be here."

The crowd: "...Someone call the SPCA-we've got extreme PDA going on."

Cameron sighed. The boss was utterly wrapped around  her finger.

Everyone was stunned. This was the same Tristan who supposedly kept women a mile away?

What a day to be alive.

"Oh right, I need to return that cane to the old man."

Following her gaze, they spotted an elderly gentleman not far away, his silver hair gleaming under the lights,his face lit up with amusement.

Tristan's lips twitched into a rare smile, and he took Megan's hand, walking toward the man.

As they approached, Tristan gave a respectful bow."Mr. Stewart, what a surprise! You should've let us know ahead of time."


Bruce chuckled. "If I did, would I get to see such a show?"


He eyed Megan up and down. "Whew! She's got quite a fire in her."


From Tristan's deferential manner, it was clear this man was no ordinary elder.

"Megan, this is Mr. Stewart-he's like an uncle to me."

Megan bowed politely. "Nice to meet you, Mr. Stewart.I'm Megan Shaw."

She held out the cane with both hands. "Thank you for lending this to me."

He accepted it with a nod. "You've got good fortune,kid. Aren't you the girl who ran away from the wedding  half a year ago?"

There it was again-her infamous history. Everyone nationwide knew she bailed before the wedding,but no one dared say she'd left Tristan hanging.Somehow,the gossip flipped it the other way.

Megan grinned. "Let's leave that in the past, yeah?"

Tristan chimed in with a smile. "Mr. Stewart, shall we head upstairs to chat?"

Bruce shot Megan a knowing look, then nodded and followed them toward the CEO's private elevator.

Right before stepping in, Megan suddenly remembered her backpack. She dashed over to the registration desk where the receptionist girl stood.

The girl was trembling, holding the bag above her head. "Mrs. Reid, your backpack."

Megan burst into giggles and took it, slinging it over her shoulder. "The Reid Group needs people like you -treating everyone with courtesy and fairness."

She glanced at the name tag-still an intern.

Megan smiled warmly."Starting today,you're officially on the team."

The young woman stared after her, filed with gratitude as Megan walked away with that spirited bounce in her step.
###Chapter 47 Tarot Predictions
CEO's office.

Tristan and Megan sat on the long couch, while Bruce took a seat in the armchair.

Megan handed out two steaming cups of coffee.

"Uncle, you've been off the grid for years. Are you back for Grandpa's birthday this time?"

Bruce took the coffee and gave a satisfied hum after the first sip. "Finally get to enjoy a cup of coffee brewed by my future granddaughter-in-law,huh?"

Then his tone shifted. "But no, I'm not here for that old man's birthday. I came to issue a warning."

"A warning?"

Tristan frowned. Megan raised an eyebrow.

Bruce set his cup on the table and reached into his coat-pullingout a worn leather pouch. From it, he slid out a small deck of Tarot cards.


"I did a reading before I came," he said, shuffling the cards with surprising grace for someone his age."Death reversed, followed by the Tower. Not great signs. Then the Ten of Swords. That sealed it."

Megan propped her chin on her hand, already zoning out halfway through the explanation. Bruce laid the cards out in a spread, then tapped one."It points to a serious health crisis coming for Tristan's grandfather."

Megan blinked, trying to stay polite. "So... you couldn't have just said that from the start?"

Bruce gave a slow shrug. "Where's the flair in that?"

Megan sighed internally. Okay, so he was one of those people. Tarot uncle.

Still... sometimes even the weirdest stuff turns out to be true.

Tristan leaned forward, expression darkening. "Can you tell if the illness is natural or... caused?"

Bruce didn't hesitate. "It's not fate. It's man-made."

Megan was mid-sip and nearly choked on her coffee.

She reached for a napkin to dab at the spill.

Okay,this is getting creepier by the second.

Bruce looked at Megan with a kindly smile. "Megan,fate brought the two of you together across lifetimes.Don't take it for granted."

Megan froze for a second. Wait. does he know something?

She smiled calmly. "Got it, Uncle."

After chatting a bit more, Bruce left, accompanied by Cameron, headed to the Reid family's old estate.

Seeing Tristan lost in thought,Megan gently massaged his temples. "Come on, it might not be accurate.

   Don't worry too much."

Tristan held her hand. "Megan, Uncle Stewart's never been wrong."

What Megan didn't know was that in a past life, Bruce had predicted Tristan would die for a woman-and in the end, he did, staying by her side till the very end.

Her eyes lit up. Wasn't this the perfect excuse to set up surveillance in the old house?

That way, she could keep tabs on Wyatt any time she wanted.

She cleared her throat. "Then let's act before anything happens. We'll move into the old estate and secretly set up cameras in every room. Just in case."

Tristan's sharp eyes narrowed slightly. After a long moment, he nodded. "Okay. We'll move in tomorrow and get the cameras installed."

He was lost in thought and didn't notice the flicker of cunning in Megan's eyes.

Getting up,he gently pulled her into his arms. "Come on, let's grab some lunch."

"Where are we eating?"

He ruffled her hair fondly. "Break room."

Holding her hand, he led her to the adjoining room.

The break room was still decked out in minimalist black and white. There was a large bed, a long sofa,and a coffee table-low key in design, but obviously expensive.  A meal cart sat beside the table, covered with six dish domes.


Tristan had her sit down while he handled the rest,lifting the covers to reveal six gourmet dishes.

Pan-seared short ribs, marjoram salmon rolls, seared scallops with foie gras sauce, Cajun-style crayfish,bouillabaisse, and a heavy French-style cheesecake.

Every single item was one of Megan's favorites."To win over this little foodie, I gotta win over her stomach first." Tristan said with a straight face as he sliced up the short ribs and slid the plate in front of her. "Let me feed you."

And so began their feeding-each-other moment.

When they finished the main course, Megan scooped up some soup and held it to Tristan's lips. "Babe, open up."

But she could still see that hint of worry on his handsome face. Megan took a sip first, then gently cupped his jaw and kissed him, letting the warm broth pass from her mouth to his.

With a soft smile, she whispered, "In this lifetime,I wanna be the spoon that feeds you milk and soup.and your favorite cuddle buddy at night. I wanna be the one who always hugs you tight. So you better smile more, 'cause when you're happy, I'm happy too. No matter what happens, I'm right here with you."

Tristan's lips tilted into a smile. "Okay." Then Megan picked up a spoonful of cake. "Try this.Good?"


"Not really."

She shot a glance at the beautifully plated dessert mumbling, "But it's Michelin three-star. lemme try it."

She scooped a bit for herself. "Hmm, not bad at all.""Yeah? Let me have another taste."

With those words, Tristan leaned in and kissed her,licking the cream off her lips with his tongue.

He grinned. "Told you-your lips make everything taste better."

The more time Megan spent with Tristan, the more she realized just how smooth this man could be.

After their meal, Tristan pulled her onto the big bed,wrapping his arms around her from behind and gently rubbing her round belly. "You're so full it looks like you're carrying a baby in there."

Megan giggled. "Nah, that's just a whole lotta poop."

Three black lines appeared on Tristan's forehead-yep,her mouth really wasn't made for sweet talk.

"Babe, I heard about a guy who couldn't get past seeing his wife constipated. Would you feel the same way?"

"No,I won't."

"I also heard-"

He turned her face toward him, pinched her cheeks,  and shut her up with a kiss.

Tristan, however, was the one suffering the most.Again, he ended up in a cold shower,while someone was comfortably starfishing under the covers,dreaming away.

When Megan finally woke up, she found him staring at her quietly. She snuggled into his chest. "Babe, I was dreaming. You went to play with water again,huh?"

Tristan clenched his jaw. Play with water? That's what she called it?

But he got up fast-he wasn't planning to spend another minute burning up.

He pulled out a soft lavender dress and a pair of silver 7cm heels from the closet, setting them by the bed."Time to go. We're headingto the charity auction."

Megan quickly got up and started changing right in front of him.

Tristan spun around in a flash-any longer and he might actually get a nosebleed.

Her reaction? Nearly died laughing.

Once dressed, she patted his shoulder. "I'm ready.Time for makeup!"

She hopped off the bed, fished her makeup bag from her backpack, and headed into the bathroom to put on a light, natural look.

Stepping out again, she noticed Tristan had also changed into a deep charcoal suit. His model-like  build really didn't need any help-he looked hot either way.

Raising her lipstick, she grinned. "Time for the Reid-style application."

Tristan strode over, applied the color to his lips, then cupped her chin and pressed a kiss to her lips,leaving a perfect hint of cherry blossom pink behind.

Satisfied, he tucked her makeup back into the bag,slung it over his shoulder, and held out his arm. "Let's go,Mrs. Reid."
八
Megan looped her arm through his. "Right behind you,Mr.Reid."

Then it hit her. "Oh right, Rachel's going tonight too."
 ###Chapter 48Money for My Wife to Spe...
The moment he heard a massive third wheel was planning to tag along, Tristan's face turned stormy.

He whipped out his phone and called Kai. "Your girl wants to hit up the charity auction tonight. You're picking her up."

Once he hung up, a grin tugged at his lips. "Perfect.No one's in our way now."

Megan blinked. ".As a husband, you're amazing. As a brother, you're seriously shady."

The charity auction was being held at the Capital Convention Center.

A red, freshly laid carpet stretched from the entrance all the way to the front doors.

On both sides, behind barricades, were reporters and fans waiting eagerly.

Tonight's guest list was packed with political big shots and entertainment A-listers, so the vibe was pure star -studded glam.

Sleek luxury cars pulled up one after another.

The men were dapper in tailored suits, the women elegant and stunning like they'd walked out of a fashion magazine.  Then a Maybach with the license ending in 888 rolled up, and suddenly all cameras turned to focus on it.

As the door opened, a pair of polished, custom-made leather shoes hit the ground.

Tristan stepped out looking sharp in his suit, walked around the front of the car, and opened the passenger door. One hand gripped the frame, the other reached inside.

A delicate, fair hand landed in his palm, and he gently helped Megan out.

He wrapped an arm around her slim waist and, as they circled around the front, tossed the car keys to Cameron,who instantly turned valet and drove off.

The couple's entrance turned heads instantly.

Megan's skin was porcelain smooth, and the soft purple evening gown elevated her grace to another level. The off-shoulder neckline hinted at her elegant collarbones, while her silky black hair tumbled down her back-she looked like she'd stepped out of a dream.

Reporters from both sides started firing questions:

"Mr. Reid, you never bring a date-are you officially announcing your relationship tonight?"

"Mr. Reid, do you still remember the heiress of the Shaw family?"

Megan paused mid-step, turned to the reporter, and smiled. "That's me-Megan Shaw."

The reporter looked stunned. The Shaw heiress  seemed even more radiant than the rumors. "But wasn't there talk of a runaway bride?"

Megan chuckled. "Only a fool would ditch a tall, rich,hot husband. Why would I run from that?"

Tristan raised an eyebrow. Wasn't that basically what you did?

Still, her answer clearly pleased him. He pulled her closer and declared, "We're already married. From now on, she's officially Mrs. Reid."

The flash of cameras lit them up like a movie premiere. And just like that, they were trending everywhere.

As they reached the venue's door, another car pulled up to the red carpet. Out stepped Jason Lewis,idol-level handsome in an all-white suit,exuding fairy-tale prince energy.

With sculpted features and sharp lines, every bit of him seemed like he'd walked off a dreamboard of teenage fantasies.The single diamond stud on his left ear gave off a bit of a wild vibe.

He tilted his head slightly, nodding to fans on both sides as he greeted them.

"Okay, okay, love you guys too..."

"We'll support you forever!"


...

Hearing the deafening screams behind her, Megan glanced back. "Oh wow, isn't that Jason, the movie  king himself?"

"Like what you see?"

Tristan's voice came casually

Megan answered without thinking, "Yeah, he looks good!"

Tristan gave her a quick pinch on the waist."Eyes on me only!"

Megan pouted. "I wasn't done! He's handsome, sure-just a bit too pretty-boy for my taste."

Jason had been walking by fast, but those words floated right into his ears.

Did that woman just call him *too pretty*?

Seriously?

He mentally jotted down a note. She's on his blacklist now.

He sped up and brushed past them without a glance,but faintly heard Megan's soft, sweet voice trail behind him-

"Nobody's better looking than my hubby!"

Jason really wanted to look back and see who this blind chick was, daring to say he wasn't as attractive as Tristan.

But his pride kept him facing forward, worried that hearing another comment would ruin his whole night.

The convention center was split into the main hall,second floor, and third floor. The second and third floors had private rooms,reserved for VIP guests-top officials, business tycoons,elite families, the works.

Tristan and Megan were escorted into the first suite on the third floor.

The rooms on those two levels had tinted, one-way glass windows-people outside couldn't see who was inside.

It was a smart setup to protect bidders' privacy and avoid identity leaks that could drive up auction prices on purpose.

Still, as they stepped into the suite, someone had managed to catch a glimpse of them.

The charity auction officially kicked off.

Jayne, the top-tier host, walked onstage in a sharp silver-grey suit.

"Good evening, esteemed guests and kind hearts.We're truly grateful to have so many generous,influential people here contributing to philanthropic causes.


All the money raised tonight will go to the Angel Charity Foundation,aimed at helping special-needs groups,children with disabilities, building schools, and supporting public service projects."

A round of applause thundered through the venue.

Jayne went on, "Now, let's welcome the staff to present tonight's first auction item-a pair of custom ebony canes with gold inlays and engraved lion heads."

Staff stepped forward, carefully bringing in a tray that held the canes.

Jayne took over, smoothly giving a detailed run-down -what they were made of, their unique design, and which master craftsman designed them.

Megan rubbed her chin thoughtfully. "This cane set's kinda perfect for your grandpa's birthday. Since it's a pair, how about giving the other one to Uncle?"

She glanced at Tristan sideways. "You brought me here just to pick out gifts, didn't you?"

The man just smiled without saying a word.

On stage, Jayne announced, "Starting bid is 100thousand."

The moment he finished, voices started calling out prices-

"120 thousand!"


"150 thousand!"


"200 thousand!"


---

"430 thousand! Once!"


"430 thousand! Twice!"

Just then, Tristan leaned over and pressed the communication button on the table (if he didn't, their room wouldn't be heard outside) and said, "800thousand." "800 thousand! Once!"

"800 thousand! Twice!"

"800 thousand! Sold!"

"Congrats to the generous bidder from Room 1 on the third floor for their contribution to charity."

The crowd downstairs started buzzing, trying to guess who shelled out millions on a pair of canes.

Jayne moved on to the next item-a pair of Brazilian pink star diamond earrings.

Tristan snagged those too-for 3.8 million.

The third, the fourth... basically, anything that looked remotely pretty, he bid on and won.

Megan frowned a bit. "Babe, you just spent, what,five or six billion in like no time."

Tristan gently played with her fair fingers. "Money I make is money for my wife to spend."

Just then, his phone buzzed.

He picked up. "Bro, ease up with the bidding! Don't you know Kai's broke now?"

Tristan chuckled. "HHuh... actually, I didn't."

Then he hung up.

Meanwhile, in Room 3 on the second floor, Kai was scowling. He spoke in a low voice, "Rachel, are you seriously underestimating me like this?"

Rachel blinked innocently. "Nooo, just thought I'd help you save some cash!"  Kai narrowed his eyes, pulled her into his arms. "Honey,if you want it, I'll get it. I've got money."

Rachel looked up at him, eyes shining with admiration."Kai, you're so cool."

He ended up winning every item after that.

Rachel couldn't help wondering-how was he affording all this? The drama with the Lee family basically had all his cards frozen.


Kai sipped his tea slowly and said, "Prestige Club's annual profit is 300 million.yeah, don't worry about my spending."

Rachel tilted her head thoughtfully. "We're almost at 200 million just tonight. You, Tristan, and Kevin are splitting the profits, right? Seems like your share's running low... Unless you're taking out a loan? You know the interest's insane. Or are you getting into sketchy loans?"

Kai bent down, bit her lip, and gritted his teeth, "Zip it!That's none of your business. I'm borrowing from next year's profits! Worst case, I owe Tristan a few million first!"


Rachel pouted. "It's fine, we don't have to pay him back."


Tristan:[Read my lips-leave!]

At that moment, Jayne gestured for the staff to bring in the ninth item-Heart of the Ocean.
###Chapter 49 Fox Eyes and Family Ties
 The moment the piece was revealed, everyone's eyes lit up.

Wearing pristine white gloves, Jayne picked up a heart -shaped diamond, completely clear without the slightest imperfection.

"Here comes the highlight of the night-'Heart of the Ocean'!

This IF-grade, entirely flawless diamond is as rare as it gets-top-notch brilliance, fire, and sparkle like no other.


So,which generous soul's gonna walk away with this seven-carat masterpiece?

Starting bid-10 million!"

"25 million!"

"30 million!"

"35 million!"

"100 million!"


Tristan jumped in with a number that doubled the last in one go.

"150 million!"

A voice echoed out from Suite No.4 on the third floor. Tristan smirked. "200 million."

"250 million!"

"300 million!"


"350 million!"


Tristan said,"500 million."

The room went wild. Even the host was barely holding back his excitement-this was a record-breaking price in diamond auction history.

"Five billion going once!"

"Going twice!"

"Sold at five billion to the kind bidder in Suite No.1 on the third floor!"

Tristan gently took Megan's hand and kissed it."D0you like it?"

Megan pouted slightly. "Sure, it's stunning. But isn't it a bit over the top?"

He pulled her into his arms with a chuckle. "What's the point of making money if not to spend it on you?Trust me, babe, I make it faster than you can spend."

That kind of big-spender romance move would melt just about any girl's heart, and Megan wasn't immune to it this time either.

Though what she really wanted to know was-who was that persistent bidder trying to compete with her man?

Didn't take long to find out, actually.

Jayne brought out the final item of the night-a  necklace featuring a top-grade blue diamond, straight out of South Africa. Starting bid: one hundred million.

Megan hit her mic button, her voice sweet as ever."100 million."


The crowd had learned by now-Suite No.1 didn't shout empty bids. So, nobody else bothered stepping in.

Tristan glanced at her, amused. "Wow, must really like this one."

Megan's lips curved into a playful smile. "Like it? Love it."

And right on cue, Suite No.4 threw in:0 million!""300 million."


Megan: "500 million."

Suite No.4: "600 million!"

Megan stopped bidding, a pleased smirk playing on her lips.

It hit Tristan-this girlwasn't trying to win the necklace.She was getting even for earlier.

"600 million, going once!"

"Going twice!"

"Sold at 600 million to the generous bidder in Suite No.

4 on the third floor!"

Megan pressed the mic again. "Such a generous soul in Suite No.4, setting a new price record for a single piece! We'd love to know who's behind such a heartfelt donation-any chance we could get a peek?"

Meanwhile, over in Suite No.4-

"Pfft!"


Samuel burst out laughing, tears streaming down his face."Bro, that backfired hard! Tried to mess with her,huh?"


Jason ground his teeth. "Shut it!"

Samuel wiped away his tears, still snickering. "No joke though,that girl scammed me too. She knows that old thief from Blackwing.Scammed 27 mil straight from my account."

Jason looked mildly comforted hearing that.

"Huh. and you let it slide?"

Samuel shrugged. "She kinda looks like me. Figured I'd let it go."

"Looks like you?"Hearing that, Samuel perked up."You don't get it, that girl Megan-her eyes? Total copy of mine. Even her features look kinda like me."

Jason frowned slightly, looking unimpressed. "If she looks like you, she must be hideous."

Samuel clicked his tongue. "Seriously? Would Tristan fall for someone ugly?"

Jason looked down thoughtfully. He might tease, but deep down he knew-if someone could resemble his fourth brother, then she had to be a real stunner.

"You think she could be our lost sister?" Samuel asked  suddenly.

Jason flicked his forehead. "You've said that about half the girls in the city already. You made Kevin run countless DNA tests-none matched. Every time some girl barely resembles you, you're off chasing some theory again."

Samuel pouted, "Fine, fine, I'll stop. Geez,my genius brain deserves more respect than forehead pokes."

Jason shot him a cold glance. "Genius? You got outdone by Blackwing more times than I can count,and you still think you're a prodigy?"

Just then, a staff member knocked on the door,informing them it was time to go on stage.

As the two walked down toward the auction platform,they saw Tristan, Megan, Kai, and others already up there.


Jason's eyes lit up. There was no denying it-Megan really did resemble Samuel. Especially those sly, fox-like eyes.

But wow, it wasn't just Samuel-those eyes were dead ringers for their mother, Stella Banks.

Tristan noticed the way Jason was staring at Megan and his expression darkened instantly, like he wanted to wrap her up and hide her away.

That icy stare of his made Jason and Samuel quickly shift their gazes elsewhere.

They climbed the stage and waited for the host to  present their winnings and ask for brief charity remarks.

Meanwhile, in the center of the hall, four women were whispering among themselves.

Lenna Cooper looked toward Natalie. "Wow, Natalie,I'm sooo jealous! Kai just blew two hundred million on jewelry for you?"

Natalie forced a tight smile. "Yeah, I wasn't expecting that either."

She didn't sound convincing though-because honestly,she and Kai had barely spoken five full sentences.The guy's cold attitude made him feel light-years away.

Lenna leaned in eagerly. "So, when's the engagement party?"

Natalie coughed lightly. "That's up to our families to arrange. I'm not sure yet."

Jessica Lunnon,always eagle-eyed, chimed in. "Hey,look over there. Kai's been staring at that girl near the door."

Natalie followed Jessica's gaze-and spotted Rachel.

She nearly cracked a molar from clenching her teeth.That freaking adopted daughter of the Reids was seriously trying to steal her man?

If looks could kill, Rachel would've been vaporized on the spot.

Lenna gasped, covering her mouth. "Oh my god,Natalie,you think the jewelry was actually for her?"  Natalie's face went from red to pale in seconds. She muttered something about needing the restroom and bolted.

Lenna and Jessica shared a smug giggle before turning to Amelia.

"Amelia,your brothers Samuel and Jason are on stage too! The Lewis family really is top-tier in Lindon City."

"With powerhouse families like the Reids and Lewises,no wonder they're winning bids left and right. That necklace will be yours, for sure!"

But Amelia knew better. Jason and Samuel would never give her something that expensive-she wasn't their real sister, after all.


Even before they found out the truth, they'd never really been close to her. Now that they knew? Forget it.


She kept her voice soft. "A necklace like that? It's probably going to our mother."

Lenna looked at her, eyes full of admiration."You're the only girl in your family, right? Your brothers must dote on you endlessly."

Jessica sighed with a dreamy look. "Four brothers...Man, I'd settle for just one. Honestly, just give me Jason and I'd be good."

The two kept chatting excitedly about the four Lewis brothers, each exaggerating more than the last.No one noticed the brief flicker of gloom in Amelia's  eyes.
###Chapter 50 She Doesn't Need Your Gifts
"Is that the same Megan who bailed on her engagement with Tristan?"

"Shhh, don't say it like that. Out here you gotta say it was Tristan who ditched her."

Lenna Cooper and Jessica Lunnon had smoothly veered the topic away from the four Lewis brothers to focus on Tristan.


"If you ask me, Amelia's way prettier than Megan ever was."


"Totally. I heard from my dad that six years ago, the Lewis family actually considered a marriage alliance with the Reids, didn't they?"

"Is that true,Amelia?"

Amelia clenched her fists at the mention.

Yeah, six years ago their family had really thought about tying the knot with the Reids, trying to lock something down early on.

But once they found out she wasn't their biological daughter, they just dropped the idea like it was nothing.

She'd held that grudge ever since. If her family had just brought up the marriage back then, that stubborn old man from the Reids wouldn't have gone and teamed up with Bernard. Megan would've never entered the picture.

If things wwent differently, she'd be the one standing next to Tristan now.

Amelia gave a cool smile. "That was just gossip.Honestly, Tristan and Megan? A perfect match, like written in the stars or something. After everything they've been through and still ending up together?That says a lot."

Lenna muttered, "That Megan girl probably knows some kind of magic or something. How else would she land Tristan?"


Jessica added, "Exactly. Girls who let loose in bed,guys go crazy for that."

Just then, the speeches on stage wrapped up.

Jason walked forward and held out a gift box to Megan. "Thanks for hiking the price earlier. All for a good cause, right? Take this necklace as a thank-you from me."


Megan froze mid-blink, her brain buffering like a crashed app.

Tristan's brows twitched ever so slightly-a reaction from the man who rarely flinched.

Samuel's jaw dropped half an inch.

Kai blinked twice, as if trying to reboot reality itself.

And the folks who were just about to leave all froze in shock.

That necklace cost 600 million!

And he just handed it over to a married woman?

Has Jason completely lost it?

Samuel was stunned. Getting tricked into spending 27million was one thing, but now his brother just gave away a 600 million necklace. Willingly.

And to the woman who raised the bid against him, no less!

Not even mad, and he still gifted ft?

Without thinking, Samuel reached out and touched Jason's forehead. Was he running a fever or what?

A loud "smack" echoed as Jason slapped his hand away.

He shot him a glare, then turned back to Megan with a bright smile. "Your eyes remind me of my mom's.That's why I wanted to give this to you."

Samuel:[Wait,what'd you just say earlier?]

Tristan pulled Megan closer by the waist and replied flatly, "She doesn't need your gifts. She has me."

Jason gave her a sincere look. "It's from me, to MMiss Shaw."


Megan smiled sweetly. "Sorry, but just because my eyes look like your mom's doesn't mean I want to play mom to anybody. Appreciate the thought though."

Jason: [When did I ever say I needed a new mom?]
 Samuel:[That girl's tongue cuts sharper than a blade!]
###Chapter 51 You Sure You Still Want This...
Tristan sighed inwardly. That sharp tongue of hers?Sometimes, it did come in handy.

He pulled Megan in by the waist, heading straight for the exit, with Cameron trailing behind, lugging a bag full of auction goodies.

Cameron couldn't help but feel a little gleeful. Finally,he wasn't the only one getting roasted by her.

She even talked back to a movie king-now that's balance in the universe!

Offstage,Lenna and Jessica Lunnon looked toward Amelia.

Just moments ago, Amelia had confidently claimed that the necklace Jason bought was surely for Mrs.Lewis.And then,bam-reality hit her hard, just minutes after.

Lenna leaned closer, a smirk playing on her lips."Wow,Amelia, didn't see that coming. Your brother really gave that necklace to some woman he barely knows?"

Jessica scoffed. "For real though, your brother's so extra. Could've at least given it to you,right? Instead,he gifts it to some random chick?"

Amelia quickly pulled herself together, forcing a smile. "Megan must be pretty special. I mean,even the top man in the country is smitten with her. It's no surprise others would be too."


On the surface, that sounded fine. But the subtext?Clear shade-basically calling Megan some kind of expert in playing men.

She spotted Jason and Samuel stepping down from the stage and swiftly approached, all sweet and ladylike. "Hey,Jason,Samuel."

Jason gave a brief nod. "Didn't expect you here."

Amelia beamed. "Came with some friends."

"You should head back early," he said flatly.

"Okay," she replied. But the second they turned, her smile faded instantly.

That necklace? He'd rather gift it to a stranger than to her.

Jason gave Samuel a sideways glance. "You really can't stand her, huh? Couldn't even say hello?"

Samuel brushed his bangs back with a snort. "Please.She looks innocent, but trust me-total wolf in sheep's clothing. You know how many times she's messed me over since we were kids?"


He rolled his eyes. "Textbook fake nice girl."

He threw an eye at Jason. "You're literally a top-tier actor.How are you falling for Amelia's act?"

Jason let out a short laugh. "As long as she doesn't cross the line, there's no need to call it out."  A sudden noise from an argument broke out, making the two freeze and glance toward the left hallway.

Three girls were locked in a tense standoff-Megan,Rachel,and Natalie.


Here's what happened.

When Natalie, still inside the venue, spotted Rachel near the entrance, she immediately stormed out,obviously ready to unleash some fury.

They ended up shoving each other all the way to the bathroom entrance.


Just then, Tristan, Megan, Cameron, and Kai walked out from behind.

Kai was about to rush over, but Megan stopped him.

"This is between girls. You stay out of it. You all, wait outside."

She said it flatly and strode straight towards the scene like she owned the hallway.

"Hey,Greenhead!"

Natalie turned and glared. "Mind your own damn business! This isn't about you!"

Megan stepped forward, pulling Rachel behind her,her look cold and steady. "Not my business? That's my best friend-we're basically family. You mess with her,you mess with me."

Without warning, Natalie swung at Rachel.

Before she could land anything, her wrist was caught  mid-air in a tight grip.

Megan, calm as ever, shot her a deadpan look."Greenhead, you've really got a death wish, don't you?You sure you still want this hand?"

"Ahhh! Let go! It hurts! Dad! Mom! Help me!"

Seeing Richard and Nancy rush out of the hallway,Natalie screamed bloody murder.

The moment Richard caught sight of Megan, his tone flipped like a switch. He forced a smile. "Oh! Mrs. Reid -this must be a misunderstanding, right?"

Nancy, aware this was Tristan's wife and not someone to antagonize, was overwhelmed by worry seeing Natalie's twisted expression.

She stepped forward, trying to ease the situation."Let's not make a scene, Mrs. Reid. Our daughter's a bit impulsive-if she's wrong, we apologize."

Natalie, wrist still twisted and crying, threw one last tantrum. "Dad, Mom! That b*tch next to her is Rachel -she's the one seducing Kai!"

The moment the words left her mouth, there was a sharp crack, followed by her agonizing scream echoing down the corridor.
###Chapter 52 One Press Conference,Seven...
Megan flung her off with force, sending Natalie sprawling into Nancy's arms.

Her voice was ice-cold. "Watch that mouth of yours.Keep yapping and your whole family might just vanish without a trace."


Natalie clenched her teeth. "You're just throwing your weight around because of Tristan!"

Megan's lips curled into a chilling smirk. "Even without Tristan, I could still wipe the Banks family off the map."

That eerily calm tone and arrogant posture sent a shiver down Richard's spine.

After a moment of calculation, Richard frowned hard and ordered, "Natalie, apologize to Mrs. Reid. And to Miss Reid as well."

Natalie stared at him in disbelief. Her dad wasn't backing her up and now he wanted her to apologize to those two? "Why should I apologize? Rachel was the one seducing Kai-he's supposed to be my fiancé!"

Megan let out a short laugh.

"Seriously? The Lee and Banks families may be talking about a marriage alliance, but did either of you ever make an official announcement? Wasn't all that gossip  just from your own mouth? Besides, Kai and Rachel have been dating for a while now. You really think you're the victim for trying to break them up?"

What pushed Megan to defend Rachel wasn't just because Rachel was Tristan's sister-even if only adopted. It was more about how much this whole arranged marriage mess hit close to home. Wasn't it that same crap that wrecked Tristan's parents 'marriage? All the damage it did to him as a kid...

Yeah,no way she was letting this go.

Nancy, aching for her daughter, finally spoke up. "lf the Lee and Banks families hold a press conference tomorrow and publicly announce the engagement,then Miss Reid should step aside, right?"

With her mom in her corner, Natalie lifted her chin,all smug. "Exactly. If that happens, Rachel's just the third party-plain and simple!"

"Heh." Megan's eyes darkened. "Sure. Then I'll just deal with Kai first. Let's see how you like being a widow before your engagement dinner's even over.'Homewrecker' seems like the least of your problems."

Rachel gave a supportive nod, but then paused, a little thrown.Wait...what?! No way! Don't take him out! She still wanted her precious Kai!

The whole Banks family trio was floored. This woman didn't play by any rulebook they knew!

Not far off, Jason and Samuel burst out laughing.  This Megan? Definitely not your average chick.

Now they got why Tristan was so into her. She was something else.

Megan took Rachel's hand and smiled towards the Banks trio. "You know what? I really hope you do that press conference soon. I'm actually looking forward to it."

With that, the two turned to leave.

Suddenly, Megan paused, turned to glance back, her grin sharper. "Just make sure you're ready to deal with the fallout. And hey-don't say I didn't warn you."

Then she strode away again.

As she passed the Lewis brothers, she gave a small nod.

Jason had both hands in his pockets, smiling. "Miss Shaw's got some serious firepower."

Megan blinked at him, all innocent. "You're mistaken.I didn't go violent at all. Her green hair just happened to kiss the wall on its own. Nothing to do with me."

Samuel laughed. "Look at that. Everyone else out here's fake leather, and she's full-on premium hide.But seriously, bro, what does 'don't say I didn't warn you' even mean?"

Jason shot him a side-eye. "You should know. Sounds like something you'd mess up on your own."

Samuel scratched his head. "Means. chickening out?"As the Banks family walked past them, Samuel added,  helpfully, "Uncle Richard, Aunt Nancy, just a heads-up -maybe don't go through with that engagement with the Lees."


Richard frowned,confused."Why? Even Tristan should be reasonable, shouldn't he?"

Clearly,with no one from the Reid family here, he felt safer speaking his mind.

Samuel shrugged. "This has nothing to do with Tristan.One Megan is enough to make both your families regret it."

With that, the Lewis brothers walked off.

Nancy gave Richard a half-resentful look. "Honey, are we really just gonna let them step on us like this?Look at what they did to our daughter's hand. If it doesn't bother you, it sure hurts me."Richard Banks clenched his jaw, eyes darkening. "I'll contact the Lees when I get back. We'll hold a press conference tomorrow. Let's see just how much damage one girl from the Shaw family can really do."

Dreamscape Manor.

After washing up, Megan sat onthe bed, admiring her spoils of the night.

Tristan looped his arms around her slim waist from behind."You like it?"

"If it's from you, I love it. Even if it was... I dunno,a poop ball."

He gently turned her porcelain face toward him, eyes growing darker. "That pretty mouth really shouldn't say stuff like that."

"Mn-"

Their kiss grew heated, rolling from one end of the bed to the other.


Duang!!!

They tumbled off the edge, landing hard on the carpeted floor. It still stung.

Megan looked down at the man beneath her, grinning."You know what we look like right now?"

Tristan wrapped his hands around her waist. "What?"

"Two worms. Two worms about to do very worm-like things."

*Smack!*

He gave her perky butt a light swat.

"Can't you come up with something nicer?"

She pouted dramatically, eyes fulL of mischief."Fine!Two snakes. Twisting, turning, passionately tangled snakes."


*Smack!*


"Try again."

*Smack!*

"One more time!"





Mrs. Jones walked by, hearing the chaos inside,and couldn't help but chuckle quietly.

These two. so wild.

The next day.

The Banks and Lee families were holding their joint engagement press conference at the Capital Convention Center.

In the classroom,Rachel passed her phone to Megan."I'm toast, sis. They really painted me as the other woman this time."

Megan gazed ahead. Natalie, also attending the lecture, turned and flashed a smug smile her way.

Megan smiled right back...and casually flipped her the international bird.

Natalie's face turned pitch black with rage

With her backpack slung over one shoulder, Megan slipped out through the back door and darted into the ladies' room.


[Oh, you wanna play dirty?Time to let me show you what "Daily Fresh Drain" feels like.]

The so-called "Daily Fresh Drain" was her method of financially bleeding them dry.

Basically, she'd inject a ton of funds to drive up their stock price, then dump it all quickly while feeding bad press into the market. Retail investors panic, sell like crazy, and the stock price free-falls.

Classic short selling.  Run this a few times, even stable companies start to crack. Smaller ones? Straight to collapse.

Megan had already bought up a large chunk of Banks Group stock a couple days ago and now her pockets were overflowing.

She dumped everything that morning and released a juicy story about internal financial fraud at the company.

And just like that, Banks Group's share price dropped like a rock-from limit-up to limit-down in one wild swing. The satisfaction was next-level.

Meanwhile, at the press conference, Richard' face darkened the moment he saw the plummeting stock numbers.

In a single instant, nearly 7 billion gone.

"Look!"


"Check the big screen!"

Every camera and lens zoomed in on the screen behind the Banks and Lee families.
###Chapter 53 Let's Update the Family Rules

The congratulatory message on the big screen suddenly morphed into a string of blood-red warnings!

[If the Lees marry the Banks, they'll fall just like them.!]

Kai's father, Logan Lee, frowned hard. He had no idea who the Banks family had crossed, but clearly, that person hit hard-and fast.

After weighing the risk, Logan made the call: the marriage alliance needed to be reconsidered. The press conference ended on that note.

And just like that, the news exploded onto the headlines.

When Megan walked back into the classroom, Rachel looked like he'd just watched a thriller. "Megan, you just went to the bathroom and boom-Lee and Banks families call off the wedding. That's some powerful peeing!"

Megan rolled her eyes.

Really? All because she went to the restroom, now it's her doing?(V;)...

The bell rang, and Megan started packing up her stuff.

Natalie stormed over, her eyes red, all the pride and sass she used to wear were completely gone. She  glared at Megan and asked, "Was it you?"

With her arms crossed, Megan tilted her head and smiled. "Did I do something?"

"You-you told us last night to be ready for consequences!"

"Oh right!" Megan said brightly. "I lit a black candle,grabbed a cinnamon stick, and asked the moon to hex anyone who scared me."

Rachel piped in, "Works that well? I'm trying that tonight too."

Tears spilled down Natalie's cheeks. "When did I ever scare you?"

Megan lifted a hand to shield her eyes. "Your looks did the job. Move it, if you're not easy on the eyes, at least don't block the view."

Smirking,she grabbed Rachel and walked off.

Since they were moving into the family estate that day, Megan and Rachel drove straight over after class.

Inside the car, Rachel sat in the passenger seat,locking his gaze on her. "Meg, you're kinda spooky,you know? You said they'd suffer and boom, they did.Come on,fess up-where'd you learn your witchcraft?"

Witchcraft?


Three veins popped on Megan's forehead. She was no witch.


This was straight-up competence,okay? She gave a lazy grin. "Rachel, it's just dumb luck. But seriously, study hard. When you're strong, people naturally respect you. Women should have backbone and independence. Don't just hide behind a man; be someone who can walk shoulder to shoulder with the one you love."

Rachel looked at her like she hung the moon. He couldn't believe someone his age could say stuff this deep.

Most rich girls were taught from birth to be perfect wives-play the piano, walk like a lady, and always stand one step behind the man. That was the norm.

But then Megan grinned cheekily. "Still, even if you dream big, Meg... trying to be someone who fights beside my brother? That's wild."

Megan shot him a sideways glare. "You know what,Rachel? Sounds like I should do another round of praying tonight-maybe get the Lee and Banks families back together."

Rachel instantly chickened out. "Okay, okay, I take it back!"

They arrived at the Reid estate and got out of the car.

They spotted Wyatt in a wheelchair with Sophia pushing him across the lawn.

"Oh look," Wyatt sneered, "here comes my lovely sis.and that orphan girl we picked up!"

Sophia gave them a chilly glance, face full of disgust. "Ugh, lost my appetite already."

Rachel's head fell and his cheeks flushed red with shame.

Megan could tell that "orphan girl" comment hit home.

Rachel had no blood ties to the Reid family, so deep down,he struggled with belonging.

As for Wyatt's smug and nasty face-Megan stared at him with eyes full of venom.In her past life,that man had driven a cold, sharp military knife into her lungs over and over again. Even now, she could still feel that searing pain.

It hurt. Like hell.

She tightened her grip on Rachel's trembling hand and shot a glare at Wyatt. "Wyatt, I think they put you in the wrong hospital ward. You really should be down in proctology. Clearly got issues with your mouth-you might wanna get that checked. Oh, and Aunt Sophia,since you're so full of crap, no need to bother with lunch,huh?"

Sophia clutched the wheelchair handles tight, face twisted. "What kind of talk is that from someone younger? Dirty from start to finish! Birds of a feather -no wonder you all stick together!"

Criticizing her, fine. Dragging her husband into it? Not okay.

Megan gave a low chuckle."And the moment we step in, all you've got is trash talk-what part of that says  'elder' to you? Like mother like son, rotten fish and stale shrimp-you all make a great match!"

Just then, two silver-haired men walked out of the house.

It was Mr. Reid and Bruce.

Sophia immediately switched to her pitiful act.-"Dad,look at this! She just walked in and humiliated me-this isn't the way things should be. According to our family rules, shouldn't she be punished?"

Rachel's brows drew together. Those family rules weren't a joke: disrespecting elders meant twenty cane strikes.

Megan wasn't exactly built for beatings.

Trying to take the heat off, she stepped forward."It was me, not her. I spoke out of turn."

Sophia's lips twitched slightly in satisfaction. She didn't care who took the blame-as long as someone got punished.

But Mr. Reid looked at Megan kindly. "What do you think,Megan?"

She smiled lightly. "I don't go looking for fights, but I'm not afraid to stand up for myself. Soon as we walked in,they were throwing insults. If there's punishment to be handed out, shouldn'tit be the ones who started it?"

She glanced at Rachel. "If they're willing to take the punishment, then Rachel and I won't say/a word about taking ours." Mr. Reid turned to Sophia. "What do you think?"

Sophia gave a slight cough. "I didn't say anything that bad. but still, the younger generation should respect their elders."


Megan scoffed, "So, we're playing the 'I'm older so I'm always right' card now? If elders make mistakes, they just get a free pass? If that's how it works, maybe it's time to revise the family rules."

Bruce burst out laughing. "Geoffrey, this girl's got real main-wife energy, doesn't she?"

Mr. Reid nodded with approval. "Indeed! Sophia,do you agree to punishment?"

Sophia clutched her chest, coughing again."Forget it.I won't argue with her anymore."

But the way she said it? Still made it sound like Megan was the one in the wrong.

Too bad Megan wasn't here to be walked all over.

Her face cooled instantly. "Oh no, you don't get to walk away just like that. The minute we got here,Wyatt threw out that welfare orphan slander about Rachel. You think we're gonna gloss over that? Kids reflect their upbringing. And as for you, saying you suddenly lost your appetite just from seeing us, is that not picking a fight?"

She turned to Mr. Reid again. "Grandpa, I really think it's time we updated those family rules."

He raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "What do you  suggest?"

Megan didn't hesitate. "Thirty cane strikes for the one who starts trouble, just like the old days."

Sophia's face turned pale. "Absolutely not!"

But Mr. Reid stroked his beard thoughtfully. "Sounds fair. If no one starts anything, none of this would've happened."

Megan smiled. "Thanks for your support, Grandpa.Let's make it official-starting now. Aunt Sophia, after you."

Sophia turned to Mr. Reid urgently. "Dad!"
 ###Chapter 54 Let the Stick Do the Talking
Geoffrey let out a quiet sigh. "Tristan's the head of the family now, Megan is the lady of the house-l've stepped down long ago."

With that, he and Bruce headed into the estate.

Megan and Rachel followed closely behind. Just before stepping inside,Megan turned her head slightly and flashed Sophia and Wyatt a devilish little smirk.

Inside the elegantly furnished lounge,Geoffrey and Bruce sat in hand-carved walnut armchairs, sipping Scotch.


Megan and Rachel made their way to the study to retrieve the stick used for enforcing family rules.

"Hey, Meg, are you really gonna hit Aunt Sophia with that stick?"

"Of course. What do you think it's for? Just decor?"

Rachel hesitated,looking worried. "But if you do this,won't they end up hating us even more?"

Megan tapped a knuckle on her own smooth forehead."Even if you kneel and serve them on a tray, they'd still find a way to finish you off."

She pulled out a rectangular agarwood box from the bookshelf. Inside, nestled in red velvet, was a dark iron  birch rod.

This stuff was no joke-iron birch was known for its insane hardness. Even a bullet would bounce off like it hit steel.


Megan picked it up, gave it a few experimental swings,the corners of her lips curling into a sly grin.

Right then, Sophia wheeled Wyatt into the room

Megan stood with her hands behind her back, head tilted,wearing a sweet smile.

To others, it might've looked all innocent. But to Sophia and Wyatt, it was pure venom.

"So.who wants to go first? Ladies, maybe?"

Sophia clenched her fists, visibly shaken, but still stepped up.

She'd seen what that stick could do. Back in the day,Harrison had been beaten half to death with it for his partying and gambling habits.

At least-Sophia comforted herself-this woman was just a girl. How strong could she be?

Standing in front of Megan, her eyes were full of disdain. "No matter what,you still have to call me Mom."

Megan snorted. "You should try that line on Tristan.Might get a better reaction."

And with that, the stick came down on Sophia's arm.

"Agh!" A painful scream rang out.

Megan blinked, looking surprised. "That was barely a  tap! I haven't even used any real strength yet. Want me to wait till after dinner?"


Sophia's whole body trembled as she gritted her teeth."Hit my back instead."

With Mr. Reid's birthday celebration coming up, she didn't want to show up looking like she just survived a beatdown.

"No problem!" Megan swung the rod again,this time with no holding back.

Thinking about all the cruel things Sophia and Wyatt had done to Tristan made her blood boil.

Bring it on-let the stick do the talking.

The room was soon filled with one painful howl after another.Sophia was drenched in cold sweat,every smack from that wvicked woman's stick felt like a punch from a grown man.

"Enough! Stop it!"

Wyatt roared in fury.

Megan shot him a sideways glance, calm as ever."Didn't Aunt Sophia bring up the family rules first?What, we just ignore them when it's inconvenient?"

Wyatt's eyes darkened dangerously as he growled,"Then let me take her punishment."

But Sophia quickly shook her head. "No, your health's not back yet!"

She looked at Megan. "Whatever hits are left for him,I'll take them too.""Sure. Happy to grant your wish." Megan's smile was faint, almost sarcastic, as she raised the wooden rod again.

Whap. Sixty strikes-no more, no less.

Right after,Megan called for Mrs. Ford to help Sophia upstairs and tend to her injuries.

Then she turned to Wyatt sitting in his wheelchair,her gaze cold and sharp. "Sometimes keeping your mouth shut can save you a whole lot of trouble. Keep scheming against others, and you'll be the one paying the price.It really doesn't cost to be decent, you know."

She paused, sweeping her eyes across the room."Tristan and I will be living here for a while. So... let's get along,shall we?"

Then, she looked straight at Rachel. "Send the video to the family group chat. I think some folks still don't quite get the new rules."

That was aimed right at Pearl and Evelyn-a not-so-subtle way of letting them know who's in charge now.

Wyatt sat there, rage thick in his eyes, before wordlessly wheeling himself toward the elevator.

As Megan wiped off the wooden rod with a handkerchief handed to her by a maid, she casually gave it to Rachel. "Put it back in Granddad's study."

Then she turned to Geoffrey and gave him a deep bow."Thanks for backing me up, Grandpa. I believe these new rules will help clear out the noise." Geoffrey hadn't expected Megan to have such guts He couldn't help but admire her. "If you'd married in earlier, I could've retired ages ago! Haha!"

Bruce set his whiskey glass down with a grin. "This girl's got Tristan's fire, no doubt about that."

Moments ago, Megan had been all sharp edges and steel. Now, she wore a bright, easy smile as she walked over and topped off the elders' glasses with smooth amber whiskey. "Tristan says you're a Go fan,Grandpa. Thought I'd challenge you to a match."

Geoffrey raised a brow, clearly amused. "Oh? You know how to play?"

Megan gave a confident smile. "Of course."

That did the trick. His eyes lit up. "Now we're talking!Someone bring out the Go board!"

Mr. Stewart quickly stepped out and returned moments later with the board and stones.

Bruce stood up and gestured to Megan with a grin."Your grandpa's a real Go master. You're in for a ride."

As the game began, tension simmered quietly on the other side of the house.The video of Sophia getting beaten was thrown into the family group chat. No one said anything publicly, but behind the scenes? Total chaos.


Pearl called Evelyn. "Hey, did you see? Big sis got smacked hard."

Evelyn scoffed, "That damn woman came in swinging. Classic scare tactic to warn the rest."

"Exactly! And the old man didn't just let it happen-he watched the whole thing."

"If I ever gget the chance, she's gonna get a taste of her own medicine."

Pearl hesitated, "But you saw how the old man's siding with her now. Might be safer not to go head-on."

"I'm thinking of dropping by my cousin's this afternoon. You coming?"

"Ugh, I can't. Lina's got a parent-teacher thing today.Maybe tomorrow."

"Tomorrow? Pfft, might as well wait till the old man's birthday party the day after."

And with that, she hung up.

Evelyn muttered angrily at her phone."Typical fence -sitter."


Harrison, who'd been half-watching TV, gave a cold snort. "Still don't get it, do you?"

"What do you mean?"

"The old man's letting that woman clean house on purpose. You try to push against her, side with your cousin, and you're next."

Evelyn paused, thinking it over. "Forget it. Mrs. Banks asked me out for tea anyway."

Harrison slammed the remote down on the table. you actually brain-dead? The Banks family's barely hanging on, all because they pissed off Megan. And you're still cozying up to them?"

"They're just fishing for info. If you think you can outplay Megan-or Tristan-go for it. But even women outside the family have more brains than you."

With that, he grabbed his suit and stormed out.

Evelyn kicked the coffee table in frustration and burst into tears.

She knew exactly where Harrison had gone-to another woman, again. What had she done to deserve this?

Compared to Evelyn, Pearl was at least a bit sharper.

She could read the room.

Lina was eating lunch while chatting. "I actually really like Megan. She's got guts, doesn't fake it. That aunt of ours has always been nasty-Mom,you really should stay away."

Then she gave her mom a serious look. "And don't pull any stunts, okay? I don't want things to get awkward between me and Megan."

Pearl shot her daughter a side-eye. "Hey, what kind of thing are you saying? When have I ever been that kind of person?"

"You'd better not be. Just stop with the whispering chats with auntie and third aunt. If I catch you again,I'm done talking to you."

Seeing how firmly Lina stood by Megan, Pearl immediately adjusted her tone. No way she was going to stand against the tide.

"Don't worry, sweetie. I know."

Julian added with a grin, "Looks like the whole family's shifting gears."
###Chapter 55 Oscar-Worthy Wife
Meanwhile, in the CEO's office on the 88th floor of Reid Group.

Tristan watched the video of Megan beating up Sophia,and the corners of his lips curled up in a grin.

A hand suddenly reached out and snatched his phone away.

"Damn! Your wife's got guts!" Kevin's eyes went wide.

Tristan leaned back lazily in his chair. "Guts? I'd say she was being kind."

Kevin almost dropped his jaw. "Sixty hits, man! That cane your family uses is practically a weapon! But honestly... kinda satisfying to watch."

"She's the only onewho's ever dared teach that witch of a stepmom a lesson," Kevin added with admiration.

Tristan chuckled. "You sure you still wanna be her brother-in-law? It might come with a life insurance clause."


Kevin stood silent for a beat.


He rubbed his chin, mumbling to himself,"What kind of gift would be good enough for her?"

Tristan replied effortlessly, "Please. With a face like hers, anything else is just background noise."  Kevin stared at him, speechless.

Tristan fixed his gaze on him. "You've got a chance to prove yourself. I want fifty Star Point micro bugs."

Kevin choked. "Dude! Prof. XAL just gave us the design two days ago, and you already want fifty?"

"Is that a problem?" Tristan raised a brow.

Kevin instantly backtracked. "Nope. Not at all."

Tristan's expression turned colder as a thought crossed his mind. "Kevin, keep an eye on our internal staff. I sent people to the black market- turns out a new type of listening device is out. Ours are one millimeter. Theirs are two."

Kevin's brows knit tightly. "Got it."

At the Reid family's old residence-

Geoffrey stared intently at the chessboard, holding a piece between his fingers for what felt like an eternity.

Bruce burst into laughter. "What's the matter? Got cocky too soon?"

Geoffrey shot him a sharp look. "Ever heard of 'no talking while watching'?"

Bruce shrugged and sipped his tea.

Finally, the sound of a stone hitting the board broke the silence.

Megan picked up a white pieceand placed it swiftly on the board. "Congrats, Grandpa."

Geoffrey looked up, surprised. "I won?" "Nope. You lost- big time," she said with a cheeky smile.

Bruce laughed so hard he slapped his thigh. "Geoffrey,that granddaughter-in-law of yours has quite the attitude!"

Geoffrey quickly reached for two fallen pieces. "No way,we're not counting that. That spot didn't count.I'm redoing it."

Bruce raised a brow. "Tsk, you're actually reneging on a move? Guess chess style mirrors character-not too impressive, old man."

Geoffrey snorted. "I was just a bit drowsy earlier.This time I'm wide awake. Let's go again."Megan grinned,"Alright, but Grandpa, how about we make this a bit more interesting?"

"What do you have in mind?" Geoffrey asked.

She flashed a sly smile. "If I win, you owe me three favors."

Geoffrey didn't hesitate. "Deal. But what if you lose?"

Megan shrugged casually. "As long as it's not life-or-death or anything between me and Tristan, I'm in."

"You little trickster," he chuckled.

They reset the board and started playing again.

Just then, Nathan entered the room.

Megan stood up and nodded politely, "Dad."

Nathan replied with a soft grunt, taking in the lively  atmosphere with a complex expression. "I'm heading upstairs."

As he disappeared up the stairs, Megan mumbled,"Feels like he's still upset over Aunt Sophia."

Geoffrey followed his son with his eyes too, then laughed, "Maybe, maybe not. Come on, your move."

Suddenly, the sound of the door slamming echoed through the hall-"Bang!" It hit the wall and bounced back.

Nathan stormed into the room and slammed the door behind him.


Sophia was lying on the bed whie Mrs. Ford applied ointment on her bruised back-it was covered in angry,purple welts.

Wyatt stood at the side, glaring. "Dad, Megan didn't even try to get the facts straight! She just went after me and Mom! She hit Mom sixty times!"

Nathan shot him a cold look. "You brat. Just got out of the hospital and already making trouble. You two are a mess.


If you hadn't pushed Megan's buttons, would she have done that?"

"Darling, Megan's totally twisting the truth!" Sophia wailed.


Nathan's tone was firm, voice biting. "You think I'm a senile old man now? Letting her do whatever she wants without reason?  If you're going to claim someone framed you,at least make it believable!

You two better clean up your act."

Sophia didn't expect a scolding instead of sympathy.Her voice cracked, "She disrespected me and beat me like crazy! One day she'll come after you too!"

Nathan narrowed his eyes. "Sophia, you're beyond help. Don't try to push my buttons with that nonsense.

If I ever really mess up, so what if someone knocks sense into me?	1

And if you're so unhappy here, then just sign the damn divorce papers."

With that, he turned and walked away.

Sophia screamed after him, "You've always missed Henrietta,that dead woman! I never stood a chance,neither did Wyatt!"

Nathan's steps faltered for a second, but he didn't look back. He just said coldly, "I'm glad you know.You're the one who broke us apart. You've always known that."


As he disappeared down the hallway, Sophia broke down in sobs, her voice echoing with grief and anger.She turned to Mrs. Ford, her pain twisting into rage."Get out! You're laughing at me too, aren't you?Leave!"

Mrs. Ford quickly set down the ointment and slipped out of the room in silence.Wyatt glanced at the sobbing Sophia and said, "Mom, stop crying already.  After this Saturday, Megan and Tristan will be done with each other."


The sobs stopped instantly. She stared at him, her voice shaking, "Ash, are you serious?"

Wyatt's lips curled into a sly grin. "Absolutely. Once we bring Tristan down, the whole Reid family will be ours. Geoffrey, Nathan... they won't matter at all."

The very Geoffrey who was currently sitting across from Megan with a face that could cry a river. Hle'd always thought of himself as a Go master-until today.

Curious, he asked, "Megan, who taught you to play?"

She blinked and said mischievously, "Totally self-taught!"



Geoffrey paused, clearly stunned. "Seriously?"

Megan nodded with a straight face. No way was she spilling the beans about studying under international Go master Justin while on exchange in France.

Geoffrey looked genuinely distressed. "I really lost this game."

Rachel chimed in from the side with a comforting tone,Grandpa,you know how every generation builds on the last? Don't take it the wrong way."

Wait,was that supposed to be comforting?

Geoffrey felt like his granddaughter was going to stress him into the grave.

That night, a black Bentley rolled into the old estate.  As Tristan stepped out, a petite figure ran right into his arms.

"Honey, I missed you so much today!" Megan chirped.

He pressed a soft kiss to her smooth forehead. "Did you now? Somehow I feel like you had a pretty eventful day."

Megan pouted slightly. "You have no idea! Rachel and I almost got ganged up on today."

Tristan fought back a chuckle. Right now,his wife was the picture of fake innocence.

"Tell me everything. I'll make it up to you."

Sniffling for effect, Megan said, "As soon as Rachel and I walked in, that mother-son duo started throwing shade. Mister Lies said Rachel was adopted from an orphanage, and Sophia said she lost her appetite just looking at us. So, I stepped up as the lady of the house and gave 'em a little taste of justice."

"Mister Lies?"

"Wyatt, duh. He's full of lies and hides behind a polished facade!"

Tristan couldn't help rolling his eyes. Where did she even come up with this stuff?

He chuckled. "You call that just a little punishment?"

He'd already seen the footage-every swing of that stick had landed hard.

Megan nodded firmly. "Yup, super gentle. I didn't even eat while dealing with that witch!" Tristan shook his head slightly. "My sweet Megan,you're just too kind."

Rachel, who overheard every word, had to admit-Megan truly had top-tier"Oscar Acting" skills, and Tristan was totally whipped.

But honestly? She kinda loved it.
 ###Chapter 56 Behind the Smile, a Plan...
Since Tristan came back late and skipped dinner,Megan decided to cook for him herself.

He watched as the petite woman focused on slicing vegetables and finely shredding meat. The sight alone filled Tristan's heart with a quiet contentment.

When Megan placed a soft, half-cooked egg on top,their sizzling stone pot bibimbap was ready.

As he wolfed it down, Megan chuckled,"Tasty?"

"Delicious. Smells amazing-just like you."

She bit her lip, grinning. "You're such a flirt."

"Flirting, sure. But 'old'? I object." Tristan casually wiped his mouth then held her hand and headed upstairs.

The door clicked shut behind her heels, and the next moment she was in his arms.

Knowing where this was heading,she looked up and puckered her blushing lips.

But instead, he just kissed her lightly.

She blinked in surprise. "What? That's it?"

Tristan raised a brow. "Why? Expecting more?"

Her cheeks turned crimson. "N-No! What are you  saying!"

He absolutely adored her fiery yet bashful reactions.

He led her to the vanity and sat her down."Here,let me show you something."

Digging into his pants pocket, he pulled out a monitor no bigger than a pea.

Her eyes lit up. "Wait-is this a surveillance cam?"

"Yup. Latest model. We talked about putting one in the old house, right? Got a plan for that yet?"

Megan arched her brow slyly. "Of course. Just follow my lead tomorrow, and we're good."

Seeing that mischievous smile, Tristan had a bad feeling in his gut.

Sure enough,by dawn the next morning, all hell had broken loose at the Reid estate.

A rancid stench flooded the whole mansion, forcing everyone outside.

Geoffrey wrapped his coat tighter,frowning."What's going on?"

Mr. Stewart quickly explained, "Already contacted the pipe company-it's likely a sewage backup."

Holding the barely-awake Megan in his arms, Tristan said, "We're heading back to Dreamscape Manor.The rest of you should go to the Empire Hotel. Once this is sorted, we'll return."

Sophia shot Megan a death glare-clearly blaming her  for the mess.


Eventually, everyone left for the hotel.

Midway through the drive, Tristan and Megan doubled back.

"How'd you even pull this off?"

Megan let out a proud chuckle. "Tweaked the valves via remote control. Once the electronic regulators in the pipes were reversed, the waste couldn't get out,so of course it backed up."

Tristan looked at her, smiling fondly. "You are such a little genius."The two returned to the mansion and set up all the surveillance equipment in spots where issues might crop up.

Before the crew from the plumbing company arrived,Megan reset the flow control system back to normal,leaving no trace.

So when the workers inspected everything, they couldn't find any signs of tampering-just figured some blockage had happened.

After using specialized equipment to freshen the air,things were back to normal.

They had Cameron bring the chef back in to treat themselves to a cozy candlelit lunch.

Cutting into her steak, Megan glanced up and asked,"Why does your dad still stay at the old house while Harrison and Julian moved out?"

Tristan sipped his glass ofrich red wine and grinned "Because my grandma had a thing for baby boys-just not me.

Julian has a daughter, and Harrison has no kids at all.

So when she was alive, she let my dad and Sophia stay at the old place."

Megan knew full well why his grandma didn't like him -that all traced back to his mom.

She rubbed her chin thoughtfully, "If your grandma hadn't been cremated, you think I could've annoyed her back to life?"八、
Tristan burst into rare laughter, "Totally possible.You'd even be able to whip out the family rules on her."


Since the person had passed, they didn't push the joke any further.

Because the next evening was Mr. Reid's birthday banquet at the Imperial Hotel, the family didn't return to the old mansion that night.

Tristan and Megan finally had some quiet time to themselves.

Right at 6 p.m. the next day,

Luxury cars began pulling up one after another at the doors of the Imperial Hotel.

Political big shots and the four great families in Verduria-The Reids, The Lewises, The Channings, and The Bennettes-along with social elites from every corner,all gathered.
They came bearing extravagant gifts, not just to wish the old man a happy birthday, but more importantly,to show they were eager to work with the Reids.

In Verduria, if you managed to land a deal with the Reids-even for just five percent-that was more than enough to make a killing.

A sleek black Maybach stopped at the hotel entrance.

Tristan stepped out and helped Megan out, casually slipping his arm around her waist as they headed inside

The grand ballroom glowed under dazzling crystal chandeliers. Powerful guests toasted each other,socialites chatted and laughed like old friends.

Suddenly,the entrance buzzed with excitement.

Tristan walked in, clad in an elegant dark suit,long legs striding effortlessly, holding his wife close.

His eyes were cool and distant, giving off an untouchable vibe, the kind of aura that silently told everyone who was boss.

Seeing the woman in his arms, many of the rich young ladies couldn't hide the envy in their eyes-she was too stunning to be real.The sleek black gown hugged her curves just right, subtly showing off her graceful collarbones under the off-shoulder cut. Her skin looked even more radiant and smooth against the dark fabric, practically glowing under the lights.

Megan had a faint smile on her rose-tinted lips,looking like an angel who'd wandered into the human world.She casually brushed back her long, wavy black hair-there was something effortlessly captivating about her.


"Is that Mr. Reid's fiancée?"

"Actually, you mean Mrs. Reid now. I heard they already got the marriage certificate."

"Oh my god, my dream guy's married?!"

"You didn't hear? He spent a fortune the other night just to make her smile."

"Yeah, Mr. Reid is seriously whipped."

"Isn't she the one who ran away before the wedding?Megan,right?"

"Yup, and he still dotes on her like crazy. even after that."

"Shh! Don't talk about that in public!"

Megan muttered under her breath with a smirk,just loud enough for only Tristan to hear, "Still plenty of girls here who just won't give up hope, huh?”

Tristan cleared his throat lightly. "If any of them try to swoop in, I'll turn 'em into roast sparrows."

Spotting Elliot, Diane, and Chloe across the room,Megan couldn't hide the grin forming in her eyes.She waved toward them.

But the next moment, her smile froze.

Kevin appeared, wine glass in hand, stepping in front of them and casually chatting like they were best  buddies.


Megan raised a brow-when did this guy get into their inner circle?


Guess pestering persistently and shamelessly does work for old guys like him.

With curious eyes following them, Megan and Tristan moved toward the stage.

Mr. Reid and Bruce sat in the front near the stage,while everyone else mingled with guests.

Tristan and Megan stepped forward and bowed deeply.

Tristan smiled politely. "Wishing Grandpa lasting health and a long, prosperous life."

Megan added with a gentle grin, "May today's joy stay with you all year-and come back again every year."

Tristan gestured behind him, and Cameron stepped forward with a long box held in both hands.

Opening it revealed a pair of custom ebony canes with gold inlays and engraved lion heads.

Mr. Reid was clearly pleased. Though, having two of these was a bit much-was he expected to walk with both?

Megan glanced at Bruce and cleared her throat softly."Well, I did notice Uncle Stewart's cane has been looking kinda old lately."

Bruce chuckled, remembering when Megan had borrowed his cane to chase off that overly flashy assistant. "Especially since it got used to clobber a  moron the other day!"

Mr. Reid had also heard the story, and now it all made sense to him. He clicked his tongue and nodded approvingly."Ah,hitting two targetswithone shot,huh?"

Megan beamed. "Not at all. We like to say. double the blessings."

At that moment, Molly entered the hall in a strapless,floor-length white gown, pushing Wyattina wheelchair, his suit crisp and sharp.
###Chapter 57 The Fall of Miss Perfect
The massive banquet hall fell into brief stillness as everyone's eyes shifted toward the stage.

After all, not only had Tristan shown up with his wife tonight, but even Wyatt came along with a date. That was basically a public announcement.

Whispers quickly bubbled up.

"Wait, why is the second young master of the Reid family in a wheelchair?"

"Heard he got that from Mr. Reid himself!"

"You're kidding-was it really that bad? He looks weak as hell."


"Isn't the woman pushing the wheelchair the second daughter of the Shaw family?"

"Second daughter, my foot. She's just a foster kid."

"For real? She never said a thing about that."

"Well duh! Who'd admit something like that? Being the real heiress sounds so much better."

"Talk about playing the long game."

The chatter wasn't loud, but it still pierced through to Molly, whose hands curled tighter in her lap. How could she not feel bitter?  If Megan hadn't spilled the beans about her background, she'd still be the glorious heiress of the Shaw family now.

The Shaws may not be top-tier tycoons, but they're still leagues above her current nobody status.

Those girls who used to trip over themselves to flatter her were now just watching with thinly masked amusement.

Good thing she'd made her move earlier and clung to Wyatt.

Sure, he wasn't even in the same league as Tristan,but the Reid family was still king in Verduria, neck-and -neck with the Lewises. As the second son, Wyatt definitely outshone most others.

They had finally moved closer to the stage. Wyatt picked up the gift box from his lap and gently handed it to her.


"Here,Molly,give this to Grandfather."

"Okay."

Molly stood up gracefully, approaching Mr. Reid with a sweet smile. "Happy birthday, Grandfather. Wishing you health,happiness, and endless blessings."

Mr. Reid had met Molly before and knew about her background, but he'd never shown any sign of holding it against her for not being the Shaws' biological daughter.

He accepted the gift and handed it off to Mr. Stewart with a light chuckle. "Looks like the bond between our Reid family and the Shaws runs deep.

Tristan and Megan are husband and wife, and now you and Wyatt care for each other too. That's wonderful,simply wonderful."

Molly turned her gaze toward Megan and Tristan,her voice soft and demure. "HHi, Megan,hi, Tristan."

Looking at her timid little act, Megan really wanted to rip her fake mask off.

How could she ever forget the cruelty, the arrogance,the sheer malice from her past life-when Molly had shattered her arms and sewn her mouth shut?

That pain was etched into her soul.

She wasn't worried, though. Molly wouldn't be able to play this game much longer.

Wyatt scoffed, eyes narrowing. "Isn't she at least your future sister-in-law? As the elder brother and sister-in -law, don't you think basic manners are in order? Even the Reids should keep up appearances."

He was sure Tristan and Megan wouldn't stir up drama in public-after all, this was Mr. Reid's birthday, and the hall was full of influential guests. Too risky to make a scene.

But he'd clearly overestimated them.

Megan smirked inwardly. Oh, please.

She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear,smile faint.

"I could've sworn your legs were fine, W/yatt. But here  you are, riding that wheelchair like it's your new throne.You know what they say-strong will despite broken limbs. Or maybe you're planning to marry that wheelchair for the rest of your life? Your brain was a lost cause to begin with, and now your body's following suit. What a tragedy for the Reid family."

Molly gave a trembling look, like she was about to cry."I know you don't like me, Megan, but do you really have to drag Wyatt down with me?"

Her soft little voice and pitiful face-anyone who didn't know better might've even'felt bad for her.

She sneaked a glance at Mr. Reid, hoping to paint Megan as too aggressive, too callous.

Let everyone see what kind of woman Megan really was. How could someone like that ever qualify to be the lady of the Reid family,to stand beside Tristan?Just then, a crisp voice cut through the noise."Then tell us-why exactly does Megan not like you? Why do you always play the victim?"

Molly looked up toward the source of the voice-Rachel.



She was strolling in with Penelope on her arm,followed closely by Lina.

Molly's gaze instinctively shifted to Penelope. Though she kept a gentle expression, there was something unmistakably judgmental and disdainful in her stare.

Molly clenched her fists so tightly, her nails dug into her palms. She wanted nothing more than to rip  Rachel apart on the spot.

Ugh, this stupid girl. Tonight you're going down,hard.

Megan took a step forward and hooked a finger under Molly's chin. "Go on, in front of Grandpa. Tell everyone why I don't like you. Or better yet-why you got kicked out of the Shaw family?"

Tears streamed down Molly's face instantly. That helpless,poitiful look won her some sympathy from the onlookers who didn't know the full story.

Whispers started among the guests, some of them thinking Megan was being too harsh.

Penelope glanced around at those whispering skeptically about Megan, then smiled faintly. "Megan's never one to lash out for no reason. If she doesn't care for someone, there's always a reason behind it.Honestly, I'm curious what kind of 'misery' this girl-who called herself the second Shaw daughter for years-has faced that she's bawling her eyes out now."

Molly was seething. Clearly, Rachel had gone running to Penelope about what happened at school.

That backstabbing brat!

And now, Penelope was calling her the Shaw family's adopted daughter right in front of everyone-humiliating her completely.

Just when she thought things couldn't get worse,a real bomb dropped.

Chloe appeared, arm in arm with Diane Hartwell
Diane let out a cold laugh. "Our family didn't raise a daughter all these years. What we raised... was a snake.Ungrateful and scheming through and through."

Molly just wanted the floor to swallow her whole.Everyone here was singing Megan's praises and trampling all over her.

If it weren't for her plan tonight to take those two down with her, she would've never shown up to be dragged like this.

But now, her only move was the same old play-look weak,pretend to be innocent.

Her eyes welled up as she turned to Mr. Reid, silently begging him to speak up for her, to end this farce.

But things didn't play out the way she wanted.

Mr. Reid trusted Megan. He knew she wasn't the type to throw accusations around, so clearly there had to be a deeper reason.

His expression turned serious, and he fixed his gaze on Molly. His voice was solemn."Then tell me-why does Megan dislike you?

And what happened with the Shaw family that they cast you out?"

Wyatt was fuming inside, thinking Molly was a damned idiot. She was totally embarrassing herself.

Even Grandpa wouldn't defend his owvn grandson right now-why would he stick his neck out for an outsider like her? His eyes darkened. Bringing this woman tonight was a terrible miscalculation.

At that moment, Sophia walked up, with Pearl and Evelyn trailing behind.

Sophia was dressed in a deep red long-sleeved gown.She looked elegant and poised, but up close, the thick makeup couldn't fully hide her pale complexion.

Dark circles ringed her eyes, and she carried herself a bit stiffly-her injuries from a past incident clearly still bothering her.

"Well now, what is this? A birthday party turned interrogation?"

She smiled, but the sharp edge in her tone betrayed her displeasure.

Pearl and Evelyn, ever since seeing that video days ago,had known the power dynamics in the Reid family had shifted.

Anyone who dared go against Megan would get burned.



She'd even dared to hit Sophia-a "stepmother" in name-which meant no one was safe, not even an aunt.

Sophia noticed the other two offering no support, and she understood instantly-it was every woman for herself now.

Standing beside Wyatt, she kept on her graceful smile."Megan, sweetheart, it's your grandfather's birthday... so many people here tonight. Maybe let's not."
 
 ###Chapter 58Truth Hits Hard,Masks Fa...

"What don't you want?" Tristan cut her off coldly, his eyes sharp and voice colder than ice. "Some people just love playing the victim to get sympathy and twist the truth.What's wrong with my girl speaking the truth?"

Sophia knew Tristan was fiercely protective, but she still tried to use the situation to gain the upper hand.

She gave a stiff smile. "After all, today's your grandfather's birthday. If the guests see our family fighting like this, it won't look good."

"Someone hasn't even married into the Reid family yet. Doesn't qualify as family," Tristan replied, his words silencing the crowd in an instant.

Megan et out a soft laugh and flung Molly's jaw aside."You know exactly what you've done. Keep faking that poor-me act, and I won't hesitate to tear your mask off and show everyone who you really are."

She wasn't letting Molly off the hook-she just had bigger plans that needed to go smoothly.

She stretched out her hand, palm open, and a moist wipe softly landed on it.

Everyone stared,shocked, watching Tristan clean up for Megan.

  Once Megan wiped her fingers, she casually handed the wipe to Cameron.

Inside, Cameron was screaming: [Am I your trash bin now?!]

Tristan: [Aren't you?]

Cameron: [Fine,guess | am.]

Not far off, a tall man with deep, fox-shaped eyes was silently watching the scene.

It was Oliver, the eldest son of the Lewis family from Lindon City.

He narrowed his eyes, swirling the red wine in his glass with a mocking smile. "So this is the one who scammed you out of 600 million?"

Jason looked at Megan admiringly and clicked his tongue. "Yup. Pretty impressive,huh?"

Samuel muttered, "You don't even know, Oliver.Jason wanted to gift her that 600 million necklace, and she totally turned him down."

Jason's grin instantly died, mood taking a nosedive.

He'd said Megan's eyes reminded him of their mother's and wanted to give her the necklace, but she flat-out rejected it, saying she didn't want to be anyone's mom.

A megastar offering a sky-high luxury gift and getting shut down-total humiliation.


Definitely one of those "never speak of this again"moments. "But Oliver, don't you think her eyes really do look just like Mom's?" Samuel added.

Hearing that, Oliver studied her more carefully.

After a pause, he nodded slightly. Yeah. there was a resemblance. But she was still a Shaw.

Oliver's cool, handsome face curved into a faint smile.He was just about to head toward Megan when a petite figure blocked his path.

"Oliver."


It was Amelia.

Clad in a white lace baby-doll dress, she looked as pure and delicate as a blooming white lily.

She turned to Jason and Samuel. "You two are both here."


Oliver gave a slight nod and walked past her toward Mr.Reid.


Jason and Samuel didn't spare her much of a glance and quickly followed Oliver.

Watching her brothers act so distant while they all seemed interested in Megan, Amelia felt a surge of resentment.

But with all the powerful guests and socialites around,playing nice was essential. She was supposed to be their precious little sister-Lewis family's golden girl.

Forcing a sweet curve onto her lips, Amelia followed behind them toward Mr. Reid.Oliver arrived just a little too late to witness Megan and Tristan's earlier moment.He couldn't help but feel a little let down.


He had his assistant present the gift from the Lewis family. "This oil painting caught my eye at the Hill Auction. I thought it would be a lovely addition to your study, sir. My mom's health hasn't been great, so she's getting treatment overseas. Dad stayed with her,and Brandon will be back around mid-month, so it's just us brothers here today for your birthday."

Mr. Reid stroked his white beard and smiled. "No problem at all. If the Lewis family ever needs anything,just have a word with Tristan. It's your generation's time to shine now."

Oliver gave a slight nod. "Will do."

Mr. Reid then noticed someone behind the three brothers. "Amelia's grown up into such a fine young lady."

Amelia stepped forward with grace and poise, her manner polished and elegant. "Happy birthday,Grandpa Reid."

Mr.Reid asked with a chuckle, "You're in college now,right?"

"Yes, I'm studying fashion and jewelry design at Meridian University."

"That's the same major as our Megan."

Our Megan? That sounded way too close.  Though a twinge of jealousy stirred in her chest,Amelia kept her smile. "Yes, Grandpa Reid. Megan and I aren't in the same class, but we do attend some of the bigger lectures together."

Mr. Reid clicked his tongue thoughtfully. "Now that you mention it, I think you and Megan were born on the exact same date."

Amelia froze. Same day, month, and year?

Even the three Lewis brothers looked stunned.

What kind of coincidence was that?

The brothers exchanged glances before quickly masking the flicker of unease in their eyes.

Mr.Reid suddenly clapped his hands and laughed."Oh,I'm getting old! Megan's actually three days older than you-not the same day after all!"

Amelia stole a glance at her brothers. Seeing no unusual reaction from them, her heart eased.

Ever since the Lewis family learned she wasn't their real daughter, they never stopped searching for the true one.

If Megan had really been born on that date. and if a DNA test confirmed she was the real daughter swapped at birth. not only would she be the rightful heir to the Lewis family, she'd also married the world's richest man.

That would be the ultimate win.

Gladly, Megan wasn't born on the same day.  Amelia would've lost it if that were the case.

She quickly buried her frustration and smiled sweetly."She's only a bit older than me, but I do think of her as an older sister-if that's alright with her."

Mr.Reid nodded with approval. "I really like Megan too.If you two someday become, what do you girls call it now?"

"Besties," Amelia chimed in.

"Right, besties! That'd be perfect!"

After offering their birthday wishes, the Lewis brothers soon left the Empire Hotel.

Amelia found a quiet, hidden corner with a good view,secretly watching that man who looked like he belonged in a myth.

Meanwhile, as many big shots came over to chat with Tristan, Megan teased, "They're all here for Grandpa's party. You better go entertain them before people say Tristan can't resist a pretty face."

She smiled as she spoke. "I'm gonna go find Rachel and Chloe to hang out with."

Tristan leaned close to whisper in her ear,his fingers brushing her soft neck in a teasing way,"A pretty face?I only have eyes for yours."

Megan's ears flushed pink instantly. She poked his solid chest with a playful finger. "You're impossible.Go already!"

Tristan chuckled quietly, gave her a light kiss on the
cheek,then reluctantly walked off.

As she watched him leave, the sparkle in her eyes faded into ice.

She turned and quickly made her way to find Rachel-she had to stop Molly's plan to drug her today.

As she rounded a corridor, a familiar voice reached her ears.
###Chapter 59 She Took the Bait-And...
"Molly, don't you hate Megan? She's humiliated you so many times!"

"Ugh. but she's my sister, after all."

"Sister my ass! That woman's pure trouble. Let me tell you straight-I can't stand Megan or Rachel. Tonight,I'm giving them something strong to knock them out,then stream their disgrace on the big screen. Let everyone see just how 'classy' those two really are."

"Natalie, isn't that going a bit far?"

"Molly,you're way too soft. Be too nice and people walk all over you. Here's the plan-you handle Rachel,I'll deal with Megan."

"What about Tristan?"

"Don'tworry,I've arranged forsomeone to distracthim."

"But. what if we get caught?"

"Relax. If anything happens, I'll take full responsibility.It'll have nothing to do with you."

"Okay, but be careful."

Just then, hearing footsteps approaching, Megan slipped behind a wall column.

Watching Natalie sneaking off, she quietly stopped  the recording on her phone.

Moments later, Molly's voice chimed in again, "Ash,we don't even need to set Natalie up now. She came to me first. That idiot running into this herself means if anything goes down, it's all on her."

Then came a distorted voice: "Hey, is this Wing God?I need you to wipe all hotel surveillance footage at Empire Grande after 7 tonight. Do it and I'll wire you a cool million. Same spot-Pegasus Bridge No. 4tunnel."

After hanging up, Molly launched into a dramatic performance. "Natalie, don't do it! If you go after Megan and Rachel, I won't forgive you!"

Then she let out a laugh so wvild, it felt like it had been waiting for lifetimes.

Megan figured Molly must've recorded this on her end too-probably edited out all the incriminating parts and tacked on just the final line.

Minutes later, Molly was humming cheerfully as she headed toward Rachel.

Megan waited for her to leave, then stepped out from the shadows.

Her phone buzzed in her bag.

"Megan,where are you?"

"Babe, I'm about to hit the restroom, then heading to find Rachel. Everything okay?"

"Some guy accidentally spilled his drink on me. Suit's a mess. I'm heading to the presidential suite-2606-for a quick shower. Cameron's grabbing me a change of clothes."

"No problem. I'll stick with Rachel. Don't worry."

As she hung up, Megan knew there wasn't much time.

First, she had to find Rachel.

Rachel was chatting with two socialites.

A waitress approached, topping off their wine glasses.

After Rachel took a sip, the same waitress returned."Miss Rachel, Mrs. Reid is looking for you. She asked me to take you to a guest room-she's got a surprise for you."

Rachel placed her glass down and followed.

Molly smirked with satisfaction as she trailed behind.

They ended up at room 908. The waitress opened the door. "Mrs. Reid's inside. You'll see the surprise when you go in."

Rachel stepped through. But before she could process anything,"Bang! Bang!"

She whipped around. Molly and the waitress had dropped unconscious right in front of her.

Megan stood there, stretching her wrists with a smug smile, then tossed over a rope and a small white pill.

"Quit spacing out. Tie up the waitress, shove her in the closet, and make her swallow this."

Rachel blinked, dumbfounded, but quickly got to work. Meanwhile, Megan nudged Molly's passed-out body with her foot, snorted, and hoisted her onto the bed.She dug into her bag,pulled out a tiny black pill, and forced it into Molly's mouth.

Once they were done, they shut the lights, crept out,and hid around the corner of the hallway.Not long after, two sleazy-looking men swaggered over,grinning like creeps.

"Heard the chick inside's smoking hot-curves for days!"

"Man, I've been locked up for six years. Been dreaming of women every damn night."

"Haha, then tonight's our lucky break. Let's not hold back."

"Ha! Hell yeah..."

Cackling nastily, they swiped their cards and entered the room.


Seeing Rachel's confused face, Megan explained,"Molly and Natalie tried to spike us and stream it live in the banquet hall."

"The waiter was the one who tried to drug you."

Rachel blinked. "Then why didn't it work on me?"

"Remember that little candy I gave you earlier?"

Rachel nodded quickly. Then it hit her-eyes lighting up."That was the antidote?"


"Smart girl!"

She looked at Megan with genuine gratitude. seriously, thank you. If it hadn't been for you, I'd be the one in that room. What was in that pill?"

Megan gave a sly, devilish smirk. "Let's just say karma's a b*tch for Molly. The waiter's pill was just a sleeping aid."

She tugged Rachel's hand. "Come on, it's time we paid Natalie a visit."

Megan wandered through the banquet hall, looking casual, but her sharp, fox-like eyes locked onto a familiar figure.

Natalie was striding over eagerly.

She wore a pale pink cocktail dress that hugged her figure, holding a glass of red wine.

With a seemingly earnest face, she said, "Megan, I've thought it over the last couple of days. I did a lot of awful things. I know I was wrong. Do you think...maybe you could forgive me?"

Megan smiled politely. "What exactly did you do wrong?"

Natalie's tone turned sheepish. "Megan, I shouldn't have talked about you behind your back. And I really shouldn't have called Rachel a homewrecker."

"Can you forgive me?"

Tilting her head slightly, Megan asked, "So you really mean it?"

Natalie nodded solemnly. "I swear,I genuinely feel bad.I sincerely want to apologize. How about we drink this  out and make peace?"

Megan chuckled. "Sure. You're being so earnest. If I don't forgive you now, I'd look petty."

Just then, a waiter passed by.

Natalie flagged him, taking a glass of red wine and offering it to Megan. "To show I mean it, I'll drink first!"

Megan watched the crimson liquid slide down Natalie's throat, cold amusement flashing in her eyes.

Oh,Natalie...

I gave you the chance to back off. But since you insisted on ruining me, don't blame me for flipping the script.

Megan raised her glass and downed it without flinching.

A brief spark of triumph flickered in Natalie's gaze before vanishing. "Megan,would you come with me to the restroom?"

"Sure!"


Arm in arm, they looked just like besties.

At one hallway corner, Megan suddenly staggered a bit.



Natalie quickly reached out to support her, wearing a look of concern. "Hey, are you okay?"

Megan pressed her hand to her forehead. "I'm feeling super thirsty... and hot. Just really out of it."

Feigning worry, Natalie responded, "Me too..Something's off. Maybe we should lie down in a room and rest?"

"No... I want to find Tristan."

Natalie's lips curled with a sinister grin. "Okay,I'll help you get to him."

They reached the ninth floor, and just as they passed Room 908, moans and groans leaked through the door-vulgar, unmistakable.

Natalie couldn't hide her smirk.

If she couldn't have Kai, then Megan sure as hell wasn't going to get him either.

Helping Megan into Room 907, she eased her onto the bed.

Casually, with an air of victory, Natalie said, "Megan,I'll go get you some water."

But just as she turned around...
###Chapter 60 Tonight's Viral Star: Not...
Natalie was practically bouncing with glee, already picturing Megan's downfall like it was a done deal.

But the second she turned around, a sharp pain hit the back of her neck-and she collapsed.

Megan calmly hauled her off the floor and tossed her onto the bed, stuffing a small black pill into her mouth.

Smacking her cheek firmly, Megan sneered,"Greenhead, I did give you a way out. You were the one who blew it. Don't blame me now. Congrats,you're tonight's viral star. Camera's rolling in 3,2, 1!"Without wasting another second, Megan darted out of the room.

Moments later, three burly men strode in.

Megan let out a slight sigh. Compared to Rachel, this green-haired drama queen seemed to hate her more.

She rang up Rachel. "Hey, all handled. I'm stepping out for a bit of air. If Tristan asks, just say I went to the restroom and I'll be right back. You know how he worries."

She hung up and slipped out of the Imperial Hotel.

Hailing a cab roadside, she headed straight for Capital Hospital.  According to the plan Wyatt and Molly set, the assassin would make a move during the night shift's laundry window.

Megan still had about twenty minutes to spare.

Ten minutes later, she arrived at the hospital,headed quickly inside, and took the elevator straight to the 11th floor, ward 3 in section 2.

Inside, only the sleeping Bernard remained. The male nurse was off washing sheets.

Megan fished out a mini syringe from her purse and injected a mild sedative into the IV line before slipping behind the bed, waiting quietly for the assassin to show.


Meanwhile, Tristan, freshly showered and dressed,made his way into the banquet hall.

Spotting no sign of Megan near Rachel, he frowned."Rachel, where's Megan?"

Rachel remembered Megan's words and replied, "She went to the restroom. She should be back soon."


Tristan didn't press further, giving a light nod.

A short distance away, Wyatt was sprawled out in his wheelchair,smirking like he just hit the jackpot.

The thought of that woman's hot "performance"about to go live-with Tristan's face plastered in humiliation-was giving him a wicked dopamine rush.

Lifting his wvine glass, he gave Tristan a mocking toast.
 
Tristan's eyes turned frosty as he ganced away.  Just then,his phone rang.

An old, grim voice warned, "By Bluewater Creek.or your woman won't even leave a body behind."

Click. The call ended.

Tristan instantly redialed Megan-but no answer.

His brow tightened. He checked her location.

Red dot. Capital Hospital.

Restroom,my foot!

Little liar.

He called Cameron and then bolted straight out of the banquet hall.

The taillights of his sleek black Maybach flared as it vanished into the night.

Back inside, Rachel picked up on the tension.Something was off.

She tried calling Megan, but no response.

A wave of unease crept up her spine-had something bad happened to her sister-in-law?At that moment,Kai Lee wasn't around. She caught sight of Kevin and rushed over. "Kevin, I think something's wrong with Megan. Tristan just ran out."

Without a second thought, Kevin sprinted toward the exit, with Rachel and Chloe right on his heels.

The three of them jumped into a car, Kevin dialed Tristan, and as soon as he heard "Capital Hospital," he floored it. Footsteps echoed steadily along the hallway,growing louder as someone approached. The soft hospital glow stretched into the room when the door swung open.

A pair of white sneakers stepped over to the bed. The man held a syringe filled with an unknown liquid,and without pause,reached for the IV tube.

Suddenly, Megan jumped to her feet. Bracing herself on the bed, she kicked straight at the man's stomach.

He stumbled hard, almost crashing to the floor.

Regaining his balance, he raised the needle and lunged toward her.

Still half-sitting on the bedside, Megan calmly slipped her hand into her bag and quickly flung out Nova Tech.

Nova's eyes lit up with a flicker of blue. "There's no tough job, only brave dogs!"

A thin blue laser shot straight for the man's hand.

With a sharp sizzle, the smell of scorched skin filled the room.

The laser seared the skin on his hand,making him drop the syringe instantly.

Before he could recover, Nova was already on the floor, recalibrated, and then-ZAP-aimed for somewhere particularly vulnerable.

Another zap, and the man's scream echoed painfully through the ward. Megan raised an eyebrow slightly, watching the guy fall to his knees, cupping himself in agony.

In her past life, Bernard had died from an air injection leading to a fatal embolism.

This time, they switched it up-the syringe had some kind of liquid in it.

"Who sent you? What's in that syringe?" she asked coldly.

Sweat poured from the man's forehead, and he grit his teeth. "I don't know what you're talking about."

Megan tilted her head. "NNova, he says he doesn't understand. Guess he won't need ears then,huh?"

The man's eyes widened in panic at the glowing robot dog. "Wait! I'll talk, I'll talk!"

"I don't know exactly who hired me. They used a voice changer-could've been a man or a woman. But I recorded it. Maybe someone can crack it. I was paid a million to come to Room 1123 at Capital Hospital and kill a Bernard. The plan was to inject him with venom from an Indian taipan. It's way stronger than your average chemical poison."

The Inland Taipan is the deadliest snake on Earth,its venom loaded with neurotoxins-50% post-synaptic,32% pre-synaptic-and clotting agents. It leads to massive hemorrhaging and paralysis; once bit, the venom cuts off nerve communication,paralyzing the body and eventually inducing death.  Even a small amount could turn the blood into jelly in under ten minutes.

Megan's hands slowly clenched into fists. Molly and Wyatt-dangerous doesn't even begin to describe them.

Just then, the door suddenly swung open.

The man spun around and froze at the sight of a tall,all-too-familiar figure stepping in.

Megan's pupils shrank slightly. Tristan.

He followed her?!

With his expression unreadable, Tristan calmly reached over and flipped the light switch. The room flooded with bright, cold light.Right then, Megan finally got a clear look at the guy's face-and it was the exact same as Tristan's.

Tristan's face was dark as night, his sharp phoenix eyes practically glowing red, every step he took was like a warning shot. His voice? Cold as ice. "And what the hell was that supposed to be?"

Megan swallowed hard. "Laser crotch blast."

Tristan let out a low laugh. "Ha! You really didn't hesitate, huh? Even with this face?"

He had a point.

That fake skin mask on the guy's face was creepy-real.



Megan nudged the little robot dog beside her. "She did it."  Nova Tech turned her head, looking betrayed. "Blip blip! Nova was scared to bits! Nova was only doing what the fairy lady wanted!"

Megan narrowed her pretty fox eyes, itching to punt the blabbermouth bot across the room.

Sensing danger, Nova dove under the hospital bed,shaking like a leaf.

Tristan didn't waste time and kicked the kneeling man hard in the back. Blood spat out of the guy's mouth as he crashed down.

Tristan stepped over him and strode right to Megan,scooping her up into his arms. "Weren't you just going to the restroom? Hm?"

His low voice had that dangerous, sexy lilt to it. Megan gave a sheepish nod. then shook her head. "This guy...was sent to kill my grandpa."

Before she could finish, Tristan pressed his lips to hers,silencing her with a fierce kiss-clearly not in the mood for more explanations right now.

The man on the floor gritted his teeth through the pain, and tried his best to crawl quietly toward the door.

Only to be stopped by a pair of shiny black dress shoes.

With despair, he looked up-straight into the face of someone wearing a grin that screamed "bad news."

Then came the click-clack of heels.  Rachel looked from the intense lip-lock to the scene on the floor and twvitched. "Are you guys serious? Did I just walk in on a rom-com?"

Then she blurted, "What the hell?! That guy looks just like my brother!"

Chloe practically jumped. "What in the world is going on here?"

Kevin squinted at the edge of the guy's mask starting to peel near his ear, then just yanked the whole thing off in one go.

He gave the man a pointed look. "You walking out on your own,or what?"

The guy clenched his jaw, then suddenly screamed,"Help! Mur-"

Before he could finish, Kevin knocked him out cold with one punch.

Then, casually flicking his hair back, he looked at Chloe. "Do I look macho or what?"

Chloe nodded hard. "Goofball Bro,you're a legend!"

All their chatter finally broke the tender moment between Megan and Tristan. They pulled apart.

Tristan shot a side glance at the peanut gallery. "Kevin,you deal with this guy. He tried to kill Bernard."

Without another word, he grabbed Megan's hand and led her right out.

The guy on the floor was out cold, and the rest of them instinctively stood against the wall like they'd  been called to order.

Megan's final words echoed behind her, "I'm fine.Cops are on the way. There's a hidden cam above the curtains-it caught everything."
###Chapter 61 I'm not Just Here for Decorati...
As soon as the two left the hospital room, something small darted out from under the bed.

"Holy crap! What the heck was that?!"

Kevin jumped up and clung to Chloe like his life depended on it. "A rat! It's a rat!"

Rachel's lip twitched. Just a moment ago,he thought Kevin's knockout punch looked pretty slick- now he saw through all the bluff.

Chloe gave the big hand clamped on her an unimpressed pat. "So, how's it feel?"

"Super soft!"

She slapped his hand away hard. "You did that on purpose,huh?"

Honestly, Kevin really didn't mean to take advantage of her- not intentionally, anyway. Bu he sure as hell couldn't admit to being scared of a rat. In front of his crush? No way. Pride may take a hit, but being seen as chicken? Never.


He laughed awkwardly. "Why don't you take a guess?"

Blushing instantly, Chloe rolled her eyes and stepped around the unconscious guy on the floor, heading to the bed to check on Bernard.  "With all this noise, how is Grandpa still not awake?"

Kevin leaned in to check his breath. "His breathing's steady. I'd bet someone gave him a sedative or something."

Chloe and Rachel nodded, the hunch making sense

Rachel then asked, "But what was Megan doing here in the first place?"

Chloe looked just as puzzled. "Not to mention that guy."

Kevin shrugged. "Tristan just said Megan was in danger... but honestly, it doesn't seem like that's the case. Guess we'll only know more once that guy wakes up."

Meanwhile, five cop cars pulled up at the hospital gates. Ryan Mitchell showed up at Room 1123 with about twenty officers.

They did a quick sweep, collected evidence, snapped photos. The syringe found on the floor got sealed in the evidence box.


Kevin pointed out the hidden camera by the curtain.Cops took it down, bagged it, and logged it for the station.

Ryan asked, "So, how did the suspect get so badly injured?"

Kevin jerked his chin toward the camera. "You'll see for yourself when you check the footage. If you wanna call us in, just text." Ryan paused- this rich kid wasn't someone he could afford to push. He let it go.

"In that case, we'll need the three of you to come to the station for statements."


At that moment, the male caretaker walked back in.

He stopped in his tracks when he saw the crowd and cops inside, the laundry basin in his hands slipping and crashing to the floor. "Wh-what's going on?"

Ryan looked at him. "You're the caregiver here?"

"Y-yeah! I just went to do the laundry!"

"There was an attempted murder here. We'll need you to come with us and answer some questions."

"Okay...sure."

In a big group, the whole crew left the hospital,leaving behind two officers stationed at Bernard's door.


Inside a Maybach.

Cameron, driving, silently put up the privacy screen between the front and back seats.

Earlier, he'd followed Tristan upstairs and all the way to the hospital room.

He was ready to charge in first- until Tristan grabbed him by the collar and tossed him back. Classic boss move.


Cameron got it though. His boss just wanted to show off in front of his drama queen.
But what he didn't expect was to see Tristan straight -up kick some guy with a matching face across the room, then immediately cozy up with Megan in a whole romance scene. Yeah...he bailed fast.

Ever since Megan switched up her usual tricks, his boss had turned... kind of shameless.

So Cameron just stayed by the door, waiting for that mystery guy to crawl out so he could land another kick for good measure.

He really thought Megan was in some serious threat-turned out, nah, total false alarm.

Then, after Kevin and the others showed up, he went back downstairs.

A few minutes later, here came Tristan, hugging Megan close, sliding into the back seat like they'd just walked out of a rom-com.After putting up the partition, he sneaked a glance back, nerves tangled.

Just in case any weird noise popped out from the backseat, he needed to mentally prepare himself.

In the back-


Tristan pulled Megan over onto his firm lap like it was no big deal.

His smooth fingertips brushed against her moist lips,eyes dark. "Still daring to lie to me?"

Megan slightly pursed her lips and shook her head."Nope, never again." Yeah right.

Tristan cupped the back of her head and silenced that  mouth of hers with a kiss that wasn't asking for permission.

Her hands clutched at his shirt collar, crushing it into wrinkles. Brain? Total shutdown.

When she finally couldn't breathe, eyes misting at the corners, he let her go.

"I need the truth. Now."

Still catching her breath, she replied, "I hid tiny tracking bugs in Wyatt and Molly's phones. That's how I knew they planned to target my grandpa tonight and pin it on you."

That cleared up why she went to the hospital tonight.

Ah. so that's what she was up to when she visited Benevita Hospital. Setting up spy gear-Tristan finally got the picture.

But he couldn't let her know that. Otherwise, she'd find out he secretly installed a tracker on her phone too.


He didn't have it recording her or anything-that'd be crossing a major line. But tracking? That was just safety precautions, like tonight. Totally justifiable.

Tristan chuckled lightly, "So, where'd you get that cute little bug from?"

Megan blinked her big eyes, playing innocent. "Black market."


"Oh? Didn't you say you were out shopping. for lady stuff?" "Hehe, well, I kinda picked it up on the way."

Three quick slaps sounded.

Megan froze.

"You know pain now?" Tristan narrowed his eyes "Megan, come on-l told you, I'm not just here for decoration!"


Putting on a fake guilty face, she tapped her smooth forehead. "My phone was on silent!"

"Truth."


With a bite on her lip, Megan muttered, "I just didn't want you dragged into it. They were trying to frame you-l couldn't let that happen."

"So, you left me in the banquet hall, so there'd be witnesses confirming I was there the whole time."

She didn't argue. That much was true.

Megan nodded, but then tilted her head. "But how'd you even know I was at the hospital?"

"Someone called and said you were in danger,so l came."


Tristan lied without flinching. He'd actually been told she was near Bluewater Creek.


Since the route from Bluewater Creek to the hospital was the same, the plan was clearly to lure him nearby and make it look like he came here to kill Bernard.


Megan frowned. "Weird, though. He lures you,then sends someone who looks just like you to do it? Bit much, don't you think? It's like. extra for no reason."

Tristan let out a quiet sigh. She always managed to find holes in things.

He cleared his throat. "Maybe they thought, after the murder, I'd show up, act all shocked and whatnot-try to cover it up. That way, it'd look like I was just trying to lie my way out of it."

Megan was starting to get confused, trying to piece his logic together.

Suddenly-"Ah!" She yelped.

He'd bitten her pale collarbone, hard.

"It hurts!"


Tristan cupped her chin and caught her lips in another kiss,sweet and deep.

He wasn't about to let her dig further, or she'd definitely sniff out the tracker he planted on her.
###Chapter 62 Don't Worry, You'll Be...
Right then, the big screen on stage lit up out of nowhere, showing two side-by-side surveillance videos.


What popped up? Absolutely mind-blowing.

Left side was a two-on-one, right side a three-on-one.



Every person in the hall had their eyes glued to the screen-come on, who wouldn't peek at a scandal like that?

It was free drama, and if it's there,people are gonna watch-especially when it's this intense.

Even the big shots and politicians in attendance weren't immune-they were fully hooked.

The murmur began to swell.

"Oh my god, isn't that Molly on the left? And Natalie on the right?"

"Wow, she looks like a total angel during the day,but this... this is next level."

"She's giving off major 'pro-level' vibes."

"Think it's fake?"


"No way, man! It's live! Wait, doesn't that room look just like one in the Empire Hotel?"

"Damn... So these two thought Mr. Reid's birthday bash was the perfect excuse to hook some sugar daddies?"


"But isn't Molly supposed to be with Wyatt?"

"Didn't you see he's in a wheelchair now? Maybe he can't keep up in that department."

"Yikes! So she's literally cheating in front of everyone."

"Yeah, chick's clearly got a strong appetite. That two -on-one setup? Wild."

"Natalie went even harder-three-on-one? The Lee family backed out just in time-Logan Lee's son nearly got cheated on.!"





People in the room were loving the drama.

Amelia scoffed quietly, "Idiot. Can't even mess things up right."

Natalie had told her about the plan earlier, but there was no way she'd get involved. All she wanted was to sit back and see Megan make a fool of herself.

But the whole thing backfired-Natalie ended up center stage instead.

Without a second thought, Amelia deleted "Natalie Banks" from her contact list.


No use keeping dead weight around.

Without looking back, she walked right out of the Empire Hotel.

Meanwhile,Mr. Reid and Bruce both looked absolutely furious.


Mr. Reid shot Wyatt a sharp glare. "This is who you chose? What a disgrace."

With that, the two stormed out.

Wyatt's hands were clenched so tightly that his nails cut into the armrest. Fury burned in his chest, and hatred swirled in his eyes.

Molly-completely useless. Tried to trap someone else,and ended up falling into her own trap.

She didn't just mess up-she dragged him down too.

He barked at Sophia, who was still in shock. "Mom,let's go!"

Sophia's teeth were practically grinding. "That vixen humiliated my Wyatt in front of everyone!"

She stormed over and started pushing his wheelchair out of the hall.

Pearl quickly covered Lina's eyes, but the girl pulled her hands away.

"If they're bold enough to do it, I'm bold enough to watch."


"You silly kid," Pearl muttered, grabbing her hand and dragging her out with her.

Nathan immediately ordered the hotel staff to shut the screen off. But no luck. Turned out the screen's power was rigged into the master system-cutting it would shut down the entire hotel.


Harrison rubbed his chin and smirked at Julian. "Damn...Molly's really something."

"See how she moves? She's obviously got experience."

Julian knew exactly what that glint in Harrison's eye meant. Woman trouble, again.

He sighed, "I'm gonna go help clear the guests. Your wife's here, by the way."

But Harrison didn't even flinch. As far as he was concerned, his clueless wife couldn't touch him.

He could bring another woman home and still sleep soundly.

Too bad for him-Evelyn yanked his arm and whispered sharply, "You might be shameless, but I still have a reputation. We're leaving!"

Harrison yanked his arm free with a sharp jerk. "Outta my way-l've got some steam to blow off. You figure the rest out."


He threw the words over his shoulder as he stormed off toward the banquet hall doors, glancing back every couple steps.

Watching the sleazy smile spreading over his face,Evelyn felt a wave of regret hit her-what kind of blind fool had she been to fall for a guy like him?

Tears welled in her eyes, just as a tall figure stopped beside her. A white handkerchief was handed over.The man's voice was low, husky. "Here... wipe your tears."


Besides feeling grateful, Evelyn's eyes flickered with something new-like she'd just seen a glmmer of light cut through her dark, suffocating world.

Across the hall, Richard and Nancy stared blankly at the giant screen.

The woman tangled up in a messy threesome onscreen looked an awful lot like... their daughter,Natalie.

Standing next to them, Logan Lee and his wife Linda Spencer wore expressions full of disdain.

Linda scoffed, "Wow. Never imagined your daughter was this kind of girl. And here I thought there was talk of marrying into our family! Where'd you even get that kind of nerve? Good thing my son didn't show up today-what a disaster that would've been!"

Logan's eyes narrowed with disgust. "Great parenting,really. If that wedding had gone through, we'd be a laughing stock right now too."

With that, they turned to leave, Linda muttering as they went, "Dodged a bullet. Imagine having in-laws like this-talk about trash luck."


Nancy,in full panic, rushed toward the screen. "Turn it off! Shut it down, now! It's not real-it can't be real!"

Richard felt like his dignity had just been stomped into the ground.

He took a staggering step toward the screen himself,wanting to shield it with hs not-so-imposing frame.But suddenly his vision swam, and he collapsed face-first onto the floor.

Nancy was too busy trying to block prying eyes with her arms to notice her husband had gone down.

People in the hall were being calmly ushered out.Some men, dragged away by their partners, still sneaked glances at the screen with lingering curiosity.

As for Richard lying on the floor-everyone had seen it,but no one moved. Why bother? They'd rather stay far away. A scandal like this follows you forever-it's better to act like you never knew the guy.

Nathan rushed in, kneeling beside Richard to check his breathing.

Still alive. Pulling out his phone, he dialed."Emergency at the JunleBanquet Hall, first floor of the Empire Hotel. We've got a man down..."

Meanwhile, the hotel staff were working fast. Since each floor had a different room layout, they'd identified the scene on the screen based on decor clues.


The manager sent ten employees up to that floor to find the rooms.


The audio from the videos gave it away-too loud and chaotic. They quickly confirmed theroom numbers: 907 and 908.

Swiping a keycard, the manager swung open the door -and immediately wanted to bleach his eyes.

Molly was in the middle of it all, utterly soaked in desire, twisting and posing like she didn't care who was watching.

The two men with her panicked when the crowd burst in, shoving her aside and scrambling to cover up.

Molly, clearly not done, launched herself at the nearest staff member, body bare, legs wrapping around him, rubbing up like she couldn't get enough

The poor guy pulled her off with visible disgust."Get off me! You're disgusting-would sleep with anyone,huh?"


The hotel manager snapped, "Grab those two! You're messing with the Empire Hotel's name? Guess you've got a death wish!"

Four staff members immediately restrained both men.

"We were set up!" one of them shouted. "Somebody called and said there was a free girl here-we didn't know nothin'!"


"Yeah, man! Let's talk this out, okay?"

Just then, a group of over ten police officers came hurrying down the hallway.

###Chapter 63 The Night the Hotel Burned w...

When they got to room 908, Paul Evans, the head of the vice squad, flashed his badge. "We got a tip-off.Someone's selling sex in here."

Paul frowned as he spotted one of the restrained men."You again? Didn't you just get out? Trying to land yourself back inside?"

The sleazy guy grinned, showing his yellowed teeth."We just gota call about some free girl, so, you know."

Paul waved dismissively. "Take them all."

Cops moved in fast, cuffing the two guys and hauling them out.


A female officer yanked the bed sheet and threw it over Molly. Desperate and panicked, Molly clung to the officer like a lifeline.


The cop, clearly disgusted, slapped her-hard.Molly snapped out of it a bit and burst into tears. "Why'd you hit me!"

Without answering, the cop grabbed her and dragged her out.


Just then, a faint voice called out from the wardrobe."Help.someone help."

Paul slid the door open and found a hotel maid tied up and stuffed inside. Her hands were bound, and she was curled up, trembling.

Once she was freed, she started sobbing uncontrollably. Paul motioned, and a young officer gently led her away.

The hotel manager guided Paul to room 907 next.What they saw inside stunned even the seasoned cops.

Natalie was sprawled across the bed, eyes glazed, a lazy smile on her face-as if she was thoroughly enjoying whatever the three bulky men had been doing.

The moment the police came in, the men freaked out and scrambled to get dressed.

Meanwhile, Nancy had justrushed to the 9th floor after hearing the commotion. She pushed through the gathered crowd outside room 907.

That's when she saw Molly stumbling out of room 908,wrapped in a crumpled sheet, her face beet red.Nancy's heart sank.

She shoved her way into room 907 and froze when she saw her daughter, butt-naked and sprawled in a compromising pose.

Furious, she flew into the room, punched the men trying to zip up, and yanked her daughter off the bed.

"No! Leave me! I'm so lonely!" Natalie slurred.

Nancy stared in horror. Was this really the daughter she raised? Outraged, she smacked her hard. "Natalie! Wake the hell up! What did they give you?! Tell me-who did this?!"


Paul stepped in and grabbed Nancy's wrist. "That's enough. We got a report about prostitution happening here. She needs to come in for questioning."

Another policewoman picked up the still-loopy Natalie, wrapped her in a sheet, and walked her out.

Nancy shoved Paul off and shouted, "I'm filing charges against them for rape!"

Paul's gaze turned cold. "We'll get to the truth. But anyone messing with public morals won't be walking away scot-free. Take them all."

And just like that, what was supposed to be a quiet birthday celebration turned into one big circus.




At the precinct's homicide unit.

Captain Ryan reviewed the surveillance footage and realized the first person who tried to stop the crime was none other than Megan-wife of Tristan.

He glanced at his watch. It was already 9:30 p.m.

An officer beside him said, "Think Mr. Reid's still up this late?"

Ryan sighed. "Getting him here is easy. Sending him away without pissing him off? Not so much. He's probably relaxing in bed with his wife right now. You want to call them in, be my guest, just don't expect this department to survive the blowback." The officer twitched his lips. "Fair point. So now what?"

Ryan quickly typed out a message and sent it to Tristan: [Boss, mind dropping by the station tomorrow with your wife? She clearly knew someone was going after Bernard, so she must have some evidence.Bring it all,okay?]

He turned back to the officer. "Did forensics finish the report?"

"Not yet."

Just then, the door opened.

The female forensic expert stepped in, handing Ryan the results. "The liquid in the syringe was venom from an Inland Taipan's viper. Deadly stuff-just three grams could kill over a hundred adults."Ryan furrowed his brow. "What's the update on that suspect?"

The forensic specialist smirked, "Well, poor guy took a laser blast right to the crown jewels. Judging by the method, I'd say it was a woman who did it."

Ryan turned his laptop around and hit play on a video.

The female forensic expert blinked, stunned. "Wait,what...What the heck is that?!"


Ryan grinned. "A self-aware robot dog that sold out its owner to save its own skin."


The woman's eyes sparkled. "That is so cute! l seriously want one. Imagine not needing to do anything yourself if some creep jumps you."

One of the officers nearby had his forehead full of metaphorical sweat. "Yeah, take that thing out and half the guys in the city'll end up neutered."

Crossing her arms, the forensic expert said coolly,"Well, guys like that don't deserve to keep them anyway."

While they were joking around, Paul walked in.

"We just got a report-someone's accusing Megan of committing rape," he announced.

Ryan let out a quiet scoff. "She really had a full schedule last night, huh? But if you're smart, you'lI sit on it till morning."

Paul looked at him curiously. "What do you mean?"

The forensic expert clicked on the video. "This woman stopped a murder last night. The suspect's already in custody, and we're still gathering all the evidence. But,you know, we're talking about Mr. Reid here."

Paul snorted. "Mr. Reid or not, she'll be summoned like everyone else! You realize how wild that incident at the Empire Hotel was? It's already blowing up online.Uncensored videos everywhere, and we can't take them down fast enough."

His voice turned sharper. "What, are you all scared of him? Pathetic."


And with that, Paul turned and stormed out.

A squad officer approaching himn said, "Captain, that mother-Nancy-she's raising hell again. Wants us to arrest Megan right now. Should we go?" Paul smacked the guy lightly on the head. "You take everything she says at face value? Think, man. Those two women are still basically out of it. We'll deal with this tomorrow."

The officer rubbed his head, muttering, "Didn't you just say we were gonna roll over to the Reid estate with the forensics guys? Talk about flipping sides."

Early the next morning.

Tristan arrived at the station with Megan.

Inside the interrogation room, Ryan personally met with them and had an officer bring two cups of hot coffee.

He smiled politely. "Didn't want to bother you two so late last night."

Tristan sat there with his legs gracefully crossed,his gaze distant and chilly. "Even if you sent the whole department, we wouldn't have come."

Ryan clicked his tongue. "Come on, little sister-in-law's here-cut me some slack."


Tristan's voice was flat. "Then stop pretending we're all buddies when you want a favor."

Ryan muttered under his breath, calling him a cold-hearted jerk.


Megan calmly took a USB stick from her bag, sliding it across to Ryan. "This has everything on Molly and Wyatt."

"From Chloe's abduction to the attempted murder of  my grandfather, Bernard-it was all orchestrated by them."

"While Wyatt was in the hospital, he learned that Daniel's daughter had leukemia. So he and Molly hired goons to kidnap the girl and use her to blackmail Daniel. They knocked him out and dragged Chloe to the Elite Club, planning for five men to abuse her."

"Then they hired a hacker codenamed 'Wings' to overwrite the city traffic data and erase Daniel's trail.And when he reappeared,they ordered his daughter to be killed."


"Cameron will bring in four witnesses."

After listening, Ryan turned to the officer taking notes."Got it all down?"


The officer nodded.


Ryan asked, "How did you get their call recordings in the first place?"

Before Megan could answer, Tristan cut in. "After Chloe's incident,I suspected those two. Had someone plant a tracker and recording device on their phones -just in case."


Right then, someone unexpected walked through the door.
###Chapter 64 This Wasn't Just a Jailbreak
The unexpected visitor turned out to be Paul, the head of the anti-vice squad.

Tall and broad-shouldered, the guy carried himself with a presence that was hard to ignore.

He took the seat next to Ryan and chuckled, "Now this is a surprise, a rare guest indeed."

Tristan threw him a frosty look. "Cut the crap. Say what you came to say."

Paul could tell Tristan was ticked off. He cleared his throat before speaking, "Got a report last night-two solicitation cases at the Empire Hotel. One of the people involved, Natalie's mom, Nancy, is now accusing your wife of being the mastermind, saying she paid people to ruin her daughter's reputation."

Megan calmly pulled out her phone and started a livestream, playing the full conversation between Molly and Natalie.

Everyone present was stunned.

"You recorded this?" Paul asked, eyes narrowing.

Inside,Megan rolled her eyes. Of course, she recorded it. But hell would freeze over before she admitted that. Who knew if they'd turn the whole thing around and claim she was being vindictive? Better play it safe.

With a straight face, Megan said, "Wasn't me. If I'd heard anything like that, I would've shut it down before it got anywhere.

As a law-abiding citizen, I would've messaged Captain Evans right away. I only got this recording this morning If you want, I can send it via Bluetooth."

Just as Paul reached for his phone to accept it, a flood of notifications lit up his screen.

[Natalie Banks and Molly Shaw's scheme backfires]

[Heiress fails to ruin rival, mom tries to cover it up]

[Faux-sweet Molly plotted to destroy her own sister]


...

One after another, headlines just like that poppedup online. Videos, audio, everything-already out in the open.

Now the whole internet knew the truth.

Paul gave a sheepish laugh, "Looks like that won't be necessary."

Tristan's face kept its hard edge. "I'll have my lawyer,Linus Blake, take it from here."

With that, he and Megan left the police station.

Meanwhile, Ryan was already leading ten officers to the Reid family estate to arrest Wyatt.

As the sleek black Maybach pulled up to the old mansion, three patrol cars followed right behind.

Out on the lawn, Sophia, who was walking with Wyatt,frowned. "What's going on now?"

Wyatt's dark eyes narrowed in suspicion as he spotted Tristan and Megan approaching. A knot of unease tightened in his chest.

"What's the meaning of this?" he asked sharply

Tristan gave a cold smirk. "You don't do shady stuff,you've got nothing to fear from ghosts, right?"

Ryan whispered under his breath,"...Great, guess that makes us the ghosts now."

Megan tugged at Tristan's arm and tiptoed to whisper,"Babe, I forgot to mention-this estate was under a signal block. They don't know what happened outside.I'll turn it back on now."


Tristan tapped her nose with the barest smile. "Smart move. Otherwise,someone might've made a run for it by now."

Megan pulled out her phone and tapped away.

As the two chatted openly, Sophia's face tightened."What are you two getting at? Is all this for our benefit?"


Megan ran a hand along the bracelet on her wrist and said calmly, "Wyatt messed up-big time. According to family rules, what should the punishment be?"

Tristan's voice was cold and clear. "Remove his name from the will. From now on, he doesn't exist to us." Sophia barked out, "Remove his name from the will?What on earth did he do that you'd go this far?"

At that moment, Ryanstepped forward, holding a warrant in his hand. "Wyatt, you're suspected of orchestrating a murder. You have the rightto remain silent, but anything you say can and will be used in court."


Wyatt's eyes darkened slightly. He ran his tongue over his molars and said coldly, "I want my lawyer."

Megan quipped with a smirk, "Even if you hire a god, it won't save you now."

"Shut up!" Sophia shot back, stepping in front of his wheelchair. "I won't let you take my son away!"

Just then,Mr.Reid, Bruce, and Nathan walked out from the house.

Sophia rushed toward Nathan, clinging to his arm and bursting into tears. "They're framing our son for murder! Honey, don't let them take himn!"

Nathan pulled his arm free and shoved his phone in front of her face. "Then take a look at what your dear son's been up to."

Messages had just started pouring in now that the phone got signal-one after another about the prostitution bust at the Empire Hotel and today's bombshell audio exposing the conspiracy between the Shaw girl and Wyatt against Bernard.

Sophia stared at the screen in shock, eyes wide in disbelief. "No... this has to be fake. They're trying to frame my Wyatt!"

Nathan's voice turned ice-cold. "You really think everyone around you is blind? You think that kind of fake stuff could get past the cops?"

Mr. Reid slammed his cane hard on the ground."What a disgrace! Spends all day plotting harm! Let him rot in prison and reflect!"

Right then, Wyatt stood up from the wheelchair and walked straight toward Tristan and Megan. "So what if you erase me from the family registry?"

Megan clicked her tongue. "Cheated on yesterday,exiled today... karma really hits back fast."

Wyatt's eyes locked onto her, dark and venomous, like he could kill her with a look. "You were the one replacing my meds at the hospital, weren't you?"

"Yup! Bet you didn't see that coming, huh?"

Wyatt clenched his jaw hard. "We're far from done."

He stormed past the two and headed straight for the police car.

The sirens wailed, echoing through the old Reid house.

To Sophia, the noise was like nails on a chalkboard.

But to Megan, it was music-the sweetest sound in the world.

Seeing Molly and Wyatt thrown behind bars was all she ever wanted. But that night, Megan's relief was cut short by a gut-punching twist.

On the way to the detention center, the police convoy was ambushed. Every officer was killed. Both suspects vanished.

As soon as she got Cameron's message,Megan pulled up surveillance footage from the attack route.

She saw a black minivan with fake plates speed up past the police car, then swing in front of it. Armed men inside opened fire on the officers.

The squad car had bulletproof windows, but not rocket-proof-it didn't stand a chance against a DZJ08launcher.


The blast sent the car flying. Five masked mercenaries -fully geared-jumped out of the van, yanked Wyatt and Molly from the wreck, and tossed them into the van like luggage.


The officers who weren't dead from the first attack got gunned down one by one. The ones who were already dead got shot again for good measure.

It was surgical, brutal, and absolutely professional.

The black van then sped onto the highway, swerving off at an unmonitored exit onto a rural road-and vanished.


Tristan saw the frown on Megan's face as she stared intently at the footage. He reached over and gently ruffled her hair. "Don't overthink it. Cops will handle it." Megan gave a small nod. "Yea. but I can't shake the feeling that this wasn't just a simple jailbreak. What if there's more behind it?"

"Don't stress yourself out," Tristan said as he scooped her up and carried her to the bed. "Sleep on it.Whatever it is, it's not your burden to carry."

###Chapter 65 The Masked Man
Dark clouds swallowed the once-bright moon, and a chilly drizzle fell through the air.

In the damp, bone-cold dungeon, two shadowy figures huddled close. The stench of mildew filled their lungs.

"Wyatt, I'm freezing..." Molly's voice was soft and trembling, almost like a whisper carried by the wind.

Wyatt looked her way, his face stone cold and tinged with disgust. "Get away from me, you filthy woman."

She crawled to him, clutching his knees with shaking hands. "Wyatt, it's all Megan! She set me up! If it weren't for her, none of this would've happened!"

Tears slid down her cheeks, her pitiful look almost too tragic to bear. "Wyatt, I love you. Everything I did-it was all for you!"

"Get lost!" Wyatt barked, kicking her to the ground."I never wanna see you again! Don't act like I don't know about the other guys you've been with!"

Molly's heart skipped a beat. He knew?

Still, she kept up the act, eyes brimming with tears."Please, Wyatt. You have to believe me. Please!"

Right then, footsteps echoed sharply down the hallway.

The prison door creaked open. Two tall men stepped inside,without a word dragged Wyatt off.

Molly didn't make a sound-she held her breath and pressed closer to the wall, terrified she might be next.

As the door clanged shut behind them, she curled into a ball in the corner, arms wrapped tight around her legs,teeth clenched from fear and cold.

She couldn't stop thinking about Megan.

Last night, she had trailed a waiter and Rachel down the hallway to a hotel room.

Then-footsteps behind her. As she turned, she saw Megan's twisted smile.

Megan's arm came up, and everything went black.

When Molly came to, an unfamiliar man was on top of her. Her body reacted helplessly. That cursed hunger took over.


She had already blocked out the part where the whole thing might've been broadcasted on a giant screen.

Now,trembling from head to toe, she burst into tears.

She had no idea where Wyatt was taken, but none of that mattered-she just wanted to survive. She'd do whatever it took.


-


Wyatt was dragged down a long, narrow corridor and into a luxuriously decorated room. A Persian rug cushioned his knees as he was thrown to the floor.


Seated on a plush chair, legs crossed, was a man wearing a custom-tailored suit and a creepy clown mask.


As they forced Wyatt down, pain shot from the wound in his abdomen. His brows pulled tight, sweat dripping from his forehead.


His hair was yanked back, forcing his eyes up to meet the masked man.


The man uncrossed his legs, leaned forward slightly,head tilted, and let out a quiet chuckle. "Remind me..what exactly are you good for? Because so far, you've been pretty useless."

Wyatt's pupils shrank with panic. His voice trembled."P-please... just give me another shot. Next time-l swear I won't fail."

The man scoffed, "Why did I ever put my trust in someone like you? If I'd counted on you from the start, Tristan could stillbe standing."


Wyatt was gasping now, heart pounding like crazy.

He'd seen firsthand what this man did to people who didn't measure up.

Human puppets. That's what they called them. Arms and legs hacked off, eyes gouged, ears sealed with molten bronze, throats fed with drugs to silence their screams, vocals destroyed. Even the nose-gone. It was brutal. Completely inhuman. The mere thought of it made Wyatt's soul shake.

"Anything," he stammered. "I'll do anything. Just don't kill me."


The corners of the mask man's mouth tugged up."Fine, one more job. Do it right, and you'll be rewarded. Screw it up again, and..."

Before he could even finish, Wyatt blurted out, "I'll get it done! I swear!"The masked man waved a hand,and Wyatt was taken away.

He slowly pulled the mask off his face, picked up the crystal glass of red wine from the coffee table, and casually walked over to the window.

Rain was falling harder and harder outside, a steady,relentless downpour.

He took a slow sip, narrowing his sharp, almond-shaped eyes. "Megan ? Now that's interesting. The game's only just begun. Let's see how far you can last."





At the old Reid estate.


Sophia sat dazed in the middle of an empty room, her mind replaying the moment Nathan had forced her to sign the divorce papers and pack up her things.

Tears streamed down her cheeks. Why was Nathan as cold as ever, like a stone that just wouldn't warm no matter how long she held it? All these years, he hadn't spared her a second glance. So what if she was the one who wrecked his marriage with that woman Henrietta back then? Was it such a crime to love him, to want him for herself?

After all these years, what did she even gain?

Only a son, Wyatt, and even he had never truly been accepted.

He was the result of that one time she drugged Nathan.


Her heart boiled with resentment-why was she never the one who got love?

Why had all her devotion meant nothing?

If it weren't for Tristan, her son would be the heir of the Reid family.

If Megan hadn't taken advantage of the chaos, Wyatt wouldn't have disappeared from the face of the earth.

The more she thought about it, the angrier she got.

She clenched the bedsheet tightly, grinding her teeth with fury.

Then, she opened a drawer, pulled out an old-school mobile phone-one that couldn't be tracked, unlike her current one being monitored by the police. After all,who knew whether the so-called kidnappers didn't actually help Molly and Wyatt escape?

She dialed a number.


"I need something that kills without a trace. You got it?"

"Okay. I'll be there tomorrow, on time."

Right after she hung up, Evelyn's call came through on that same phone.

Sophia answered quickly. "Evelyn, what are we going to do about Wyatt?"

Evelyn replied, "Cousin, if they grabbed Wyatt, that means he's still useful to them. They won't hurt him.Try not to overthink it-maybe they even saved him."

"I can't help worrying," Sophia said with a trembling voice. "Just thinking about them ruining my son makes my blood boil."

"You're right. Ever since that little tramp came into the Reid family, it's been nothing but chaos," Evelyn sighed.

Sophia took a breath and said coldly, "That's why I reached out to that person again."

"What? You're not planning to go down that road again, are you?" Evelyn asked, alarmed.

"There won't be any problems," Sophia said firmly."Back then, I got a poison from that person and slipped it in that woman Henrietta's food. That's why she died so fast. No one ever suspected a thing.Everyone just thought she had some random illness.Now they're throwing me out of the Reid family. If I don't act soon, I won't get another shot."

"Just promise me you'll be careful," Evelyn urged.

Sophia gripped the phone tighter, excitement building in her chest. The thought of getting rid of those people, one by one, gave her an indescribable thrill. Unbeknownst to her, this very moment had been seen -every expression and movement-by Megan, who couldn't fall asleep that night.

She had never imagined the person behind Tristan's mother's sudden death was Sophia.

An accidental discovery had just blown the lid off a murder buried for years.

Guess karma really does come around. Bad deeds don't stay hidden forever.

She glanced back at the man sleeping soundly beside her, and wondered-what would he do if he ever found out his mother didn't die of illness,but was murdered?

Megan lowered her gaze, lost in thought for a long time. In the end, she decided to wait-wait until the moment Sophia was caught red-handed, then tell him the truth.
###Chapter 66 We're Trying for A Baby
Early next morning.

Tristan left for the office early-he had a big video meeting to attend.

Meanwhile, Megan drove alone to Meridian University,waiting by the gate for Rachel.

Soon enough, Rachel slid into the passenger seat.

"Morning,Megan."

Megan handed her a dessert. "Grabbed this from Fuki's Sweets on the way."

"Being this nice for no reason? Feels fishy.Ow!"

Before she could finish, Megan smacked her lightly on the forehead.


"Ouch! That hurt,Meg."

Megan chuckled. "Well, you're not totally wrong

Today, we're skipping class together."

"Skipping class? Heck yeah,living the dream!"

Megan's lip twitched. Typical slacker-totally proud of cutting class.

"So, where are we off to?"

Megan pulled a laptop from her bag. A crowded map popped up with one little red dot blinking on it. "We're ghost hunting."

"Huh?? Ghosts?" Rachel blinked, but Megan was already stepping on the gas, the car zooming off after that red dot.

On the way, Megan told Rachel to text Kai,have him follow along quietly, and not to breathe a word to Tristan.

Eventually, the red dot stopped at a narrow walkway between a café and a sushi bar.


Megan and Rachel hopped out and crouched behind a wall, camera in hand.

Rachel whispered, "Wait a sec, isn't that Aunt Sophia?What's she sneaking around for?"

"She's ghost-watching," Megan muttered.

That was all Rachel needed to grasp this wasn't some random errand. She watched Sophia, wearing sunglasses, constantly glancing around-total sketch vibes.

Suddenly, Rachel felt a weight on her shoulder.She turned to see Kai.

"What's with all the cloak-and-dagger stuff?"

Rachel raised a finger to her lips, "Shhh. Aunt Sophia's cheating. We're here to bust her."

Kai let out a low whistle. "Whoa, hardcore. Trying to collect dirt for Uncle?"


Megan rolled her eyes."." Not long after, a young guy with bleached-blond hair showed up, cigarette dangling from his mouth, eyes sharp and twitchy. He handed Sophia a small white envelope; she gave him a fat brown folder in return.

Nova Tech, the robot Megan brought, captured the whole shady exchange.

Rachel whistled. "I mean, wow. Didn't think someone her age would be popping pills. Maybe that night's big screen drama really wrecked her nerves?"

Megan was speechless.

Rachel grinned toward Kai, "Too bad you didn't see it,bro. That scene was pure chaos, unforgettable."

Kai bonked her lightly on the head. "You want me checking out other women.now?"

Rachel giggled, "Nope! Only allowed to look at me."

Megan took a deep breath. "Kai, your job is to catch the young guy and make him talk. We need answers -whatever it takes."

Now Kai finally understood why he got dragged into this-manual labor. But hey, she was Tristan's wife, and when she said "whatever it takes," it oddly sounded cool.

He vanished like a shadow.


Megan and Rachel took off, following Sophia at a distance.


Sophia, for some reason, decided to play the good housewife today. She loaded up on fruits, vegetables, and meat at the grocery store before heading back to the Reid family estate.

She dumped the groceries in the kitchen,which left the maids stunned. A pampered woman like Sophia,who never even peeled a fruit, actually went grocery shopping herself?

She asked around and was told Mr. Reid was in the study, playing chess with Bruce.She quickly adjusted her sad expression and walked over to greet Mr. Reid.

"Dad,Nathan's already asked for a divorce. I've signed the papers too. Today's probably my last day in the Reid family. I wanted to cook for everyone myself,one last meal before I go. After all, I've been part of this family for so many years. it's hard to let go."

Mr. Reid sighed. "Sophia, I can't interfere in matters between you and Nathan. But I still care about Wyatt's situation-he's my grandson after all. I've already asked Tristan to send people to investigate. Don't worry too much."


Tristan again? Always Tristan!

Why the hell hasn't that man dropped dead yet?

And where the hell is her son right now?

Sophia kept her grateful smile on the surface, but inside she was boiling with hate. If Mrs. Reid was still alive, there's no way she would've let Nathan divorce her. And Tristan? He wouldn't have become the head of the family. As for that nobody Megan? Dream on about stepping into the Reid household. But too bad-for her, there's no "if" in life. She couldn't care less about what Mr. Reid said about Wyatt. His "concern" didn't move her one bit.

Today,she was ready to burn every bridge behind her.

If she had to go down, nobody was getting out clean.

Sophia nodded gently, squeezing out a few crocodile tears. "Dad, I'll go start cooking. Could you please let everyone know? I'd like to say goodbye properly."

Mr. Reid watched as she dabbed her tears and walked out of the study. He dropped the chess piece in his hand with a heavy thud.

"See? The marriage I didn't approve back then is finally falling apart. My wife won't rest easy even in the afterlife."


Bruce let out a belly laugh. "Shouldn't you start worrying about whether you're gonna see your wife again soon?"

Mr. Reid scoffed, "Not yet. I want to meet my great-grandkids first."

Bruce flicked a white piece right on top of a black one "You know what they say-people who act too nice when they don't need to usually have bad intentions.And when they show up with a favor out of nowhere?Definitely plotting something nasty."

Mr. Reid's hand slipped-the black chess piece crashed into the board, ruining the game in an instant.

-Lunchtime, family gathering. The dining table was packed with mouthwatering dishes. Everyone from the Reid family was present,except Wyatt.

Well,not really a surprise. He'd already been removed his name from the will-technically, he's no longer part of this family.

Sophia's eyes looked puffy and red, her voice thick like she'd been crying for hours. "I've been a part of this family for twenty-five years. Never thought I'd be walking away from such a warm home. It's all my fault.I wasn't a good wife, nor did I raise my son right. I've brought a lot of trouble over the years. Just wanted to have one final meal with all of you-chances are, there won't be another. Here's a toast from me."


With that, she tilted the glass back and downed the wine in one go. Then wiped the corner of her mouth,scanning the faces around the table.

Megan stood with a smile, raising her glass. "I don't hold my liquor well, Sophia. Mind switching drinks with me?"


Sophia froze, clearly caught off guard. Her smile twitched."Oh...maybe Tristan could drink for you?"

Megan picked up Tristan's glass too. "We're trying for a baby. Doctor's orders-no alcohol for either of us."

Tristan raised an eyebrow. "Trying? Since when?"

Evelyn stood up quickly, lifting her own glass. "Well,then let me toast my lovely cousin first." Megan held up a hand."Wait."

She gently slid both glasses toward Evelyn,still smiling "You've always had a strong tolerance, Auntie. Why not toast Sophia for the both of us?"
###Chapter 67 Tonight Wasn't A Regular...
When Megan kept refusing to take even a sip of her drink, a flicker of surprise flashed through Sophia's eyes. Could that little witch have figured something out? No way-she'd covered her tracks perfectly.

Evelyn quickly set down her wine glass and picked up a juice instead. "Wrong cup," she said hastily. "I don't hold my liquor well-it's supposed to be juice for me."

Sophia let out a quiet sigh of relief. She nodded quickly, echoing,"Right,my cousin really can't handle her drinks."


Evelyn gulped down the juice like her life depended on it, clearly terrified Megan would push her to drink again. Her heart felt like it was about to leap straight out of her chest. She was pretty sure Sophia had messed with both Megan's and Tristan's drinks.

Sophia looked around, but no one else at the table made a move toward their glass. She turned to Nathan with a suggestion laced in emotion. "We were married once. This might be my last dinner with the Reid family. Nathan, will you share one last drink with me?"

Nathan sighed heavily, the sound sharp through his nose. He stood, lifted a crystal glass of red wine, and said flatly, "Fine. One last drink. After this, we're complete strangers."

Sophia's lips tightened, her eyes glinting dangerously at his words. Just as Nathan was about to bring the glass to his lips, a voice cut in.

"If Aunt Sophia and Dad spent so many years together, they should do it properly. How about a romantic toast? Aunt Sophia drinks Dad's wine, and Dad drinks hers."


Nathan's brows drew together, his tone stern. "Megan,that's enough. Don't joke around."

Sophia's expression changed in a flash. "Yeah, the divorce is done-no need for that kind of toast anymore."

Megan stood, hands clasped behind her back as she strolled toward Sophia, who was already looking nervous. "Is it really inappropriate? Or are you just scared to drink it?"


Sophia forced an awkward laugh. "Oh please. What's there to be afraid of? It's just... not the time."

Megan dragged all the wine glasses on the table toward Sophia. "Aunt Sophia, if you down every one of these drinks, the Reid family fortune's all yours."

Sophia lowered her gaze, her voice firm with pretend righteousness. "What would I want that money for?I just wanted to share one peaceful meal with everyone.Is that too much to ask?"

 
And with that, tears welled up in her eyes. She turned to leave,but Megan grabbed her wrist hard-so hard it must've hurt. For a brief second, Sophia shot Megan a venomous glare like a coiled snake before bursting into sobs.


She sobbed, "If none of you even want to eat with me one last time, then fine. Enjoy dinner without me."

She tried to walk again, but Megan's grip only got tighter.

The whole dining room went quiet. The air suddenly felt colder,heavier.


Megan's long black hair fell down to her waist like silk.Her pale face was framed by an unsettling smile-charming and dangerous rolled into one. She held Sophia's wrist like it was just some toy, with zero hesitation or care.


"You're not going anywhere until you've eaten-and drank-every single thing here."

Julian and Pearl exchanged a glance. Something was definitely off.

Lina caught Rachel winking at her. That sealed it-tonight wasn't a regular dinner. It was obviously a trap.

Penelope seemed to catch on. She picked up a glass of blood-red wine and walked straight to Sophia.

She rested the glass gently against Sophia's lips and said, "Sophia, drink it down."

Sophia flinched, turning her face away. "I won't drink it."  Penelope didn't even hesitate-she grabbed Sophia's chin and tilted it up, pushing the glass toward her mouth.


Sophia's eyes went wide with panic. Then she slapped the glass away.Crash!

The wine glass hit the Roman-style tiles and shattered into pieces.

Red wine splashed all over Sophia's white slacks, and the color contrast was jarring.

Megan jerked her hand away, a mocking smile tugging at her lips. "Stains on pants can be cleaned,but blood on your hands? That's way harder to wash off."

She then turned to Evelyn, "Don't you think so, Auntie?"

Evelyn swallowed hard, eyes shifting nervously as she nodded stiffly. "Y-yeah, sounds about right."

Megan clapped lightly, and Nova Tech pokedits head out from under the seat and hopped onto the table.

"Hey there everyone! I'm Nova! I've got the coolest,kindest,prettiest owner ever-Megan! Super thrilled to show off my skilIs for y'all today!"

Megan:"..."

Could you not hype yourself up before getting to the point?

Seriously, the mutt's got a bragging subroutine?

Everyone was still reelingfrom the talking mechanical dog when Nova struck a wveird pose-front paws planted, butt in the air, tail up. Not exactly elegant.

Then,from beneath its tail, a beam of blue light fired out.

And bam-the holographic screen lit up midair, playing a very familiar video.

There she was-Sophia, caught red-handed in a shady hallway doing a deal with that punk, Yellow Hair.

Sophia's face went pale. Her lashes fluttered nervously as she tried to keep her composure. "This doesn't prove anything. It's just... it's nothing,really."

Rachel let out a scoff from the side. "Sneaking around behind my uncle's back and making dirty deals? Yeah,no wonder you signed the divorce papers so fast."

Megan: "..." Umm... totally not what this is about.

Clearly Sophia thought her affair was the issue and got momentarily relieved.

She settled down a bit and smiled with affected calm."I've always had a clear conscience. I never betrayed your uncle."

"But what you actually did is even worse!" Megan cut her off, raising her voice. "Bring them in!"

At that cue, Kai strolled into the dining room with his hands casually shoved in his pockets. Behind him,two men in black suits dragged a beaten-up Yellow Hair.

Now, his face was so battered, even his own mom wouldn't have known him.


Upon seeing Mr. Reid and Bruce, Kai straightened up and gave a respectful bow to them, then to Nathan and Penelope.

"This man," Kai said, "goes by Toby Collins. He was sent to meet a woman in sunglasses in the alley between a coffee shop and a sushi place. Didn't recognize what was being handed over, but he said he peeked-it was ten white pills. Sophia accepted the goods and handed over a brown envelope stuffed with a hundred grand in cash. We've now caught the woman who contacted Toby as well."


Footsteps approached.

Two bodyguards brought in an older man, maybe around sixty, silver hair at the temples, dressed in a suit.


Without a word, one of them kicked the back of the man's knees, sending him crashing to the floor.

"Talk or take it the hard way-your choice," someone barked.


The man looked up at Megan, clearly confused. Since when did it become "talk or ELSE".?


Still, he clenched his jaw and turned his head away silently, refusing to flatter or grovel.

Megan crossed her arms. "Guys like you? Filthy to the bone. You're better off gone. Nova!"

Nova leaped from the table to her shoulder. "Got it,Goddess!"

"He's stubborn. Show him what you can really do."  With a buzz, two sleek metal wings unfolded from Nova's back.


It zipped to hover right in front of the man."Let Nova give you a lip tattoo!"

Huh...?

The man turned back, staring at the weird, chatty dog -just in time to see a thin needle pop out from Nova's muzzle, tip already glistening with red liquid.It lunged straight at the man's mouth.
###Chapter 68 Do All The Bad Things
The man was being totally uncooperative,so the two bodyguards grabbed his face to hold him still.

In his wide, terrified eyes, the reflection of a mechanical dog with wings filled his vision.

"Mmmf! Mmmmf!"

He stared in horror, helpless as Nova Tech calmly tattooed his lips.

Three minutes later, Nova Tech retracted the steel needle and flew back to Megan's shoulder like nothing had happened.

Hovering over the crying man on his knees, it commented, "Oops, Nova might've made his mouth look like a clown's."


The guy's teeth were chattering. The moment that needle started jabbing into his skin non-stop, he knew -his face was done for.


The people around the dining table were all stunned.

Especially Sophia and Evelyn, whose guilty expressions were impossible to hide.

Megan raised an eyebrow and glanced at the man drenched in cold sweat. "Want me to throw in some eyeliner too? Worst case, it gets inked on your eyeballs."

Nova gave an excited "Yoo-hoo!" and zipped toward the man again.


"Stop! Please! I'll talk-I'll tell you whatever you want,just don't let that thing touch me again!" he yelled out in panic.

Megan exchanged a look with Kai, who immediately dragged a chair over with a knowing nod.

She sat down like a queen, her sharp gaze locked on the man kneeling before her. "Then start talking."

The man shot a glance at Sophia. "Last night, a woman called and asked for a poison that kills without a trace. We agreed to meet in the alley between the coffee shop and the sushi place. Just to be safe, I sent one of my guys from an internet café to handle it. Still got caught in the end. Lucky me."

Megan's eyes turned icy. "Tell me more about this invisible poison. How does it work? What happens to the person who takes it?"

He kept talking, "It's a small white pill-contains botulinum toxin. That stuff's lethal. Type-A is especially bad-odorless, colorless, dissolves easily in water.It attacks the nervous system, causes dizziness,trouble breathing, and if the respiratory muscles stop working, death. Just 0.24 milligrams can kill someone."

Megan turned to look at Sophia, her eyes narrowing."Aunt Sophia, I'm guessing the dose you put in my wine was way more than 0.24 milligrams, right?"  Sophia clenched her fists tight and forced a calm voice, "I have no idea what you're talking about."

Megan actually liked this type-the ones who insisted until the bitter end. They usually got slapped the hardest by the truth.

She tilted her chin at the man. "Eighteen years ago,this same woman also bought that poison from you.Ring any bells?"

The man studied Sophia's face closely. She instantly dropped her stare, clearly rattled.

Sure,eighteen years will age most people.

But Sophia had maintained herself well over the years -sadly, only on the outside. The darkness inside? Still alive and kicking.

He nodded hard. "It's her. She bought that same poison from me back then too."

"You're lying!" Sophia screamed. "They made you say this to frame me!"


He held up his hands. "Look, I remember her because she was stunning. Didn't expect someone that pretty to be looking for murder drugs. I even gave her a nickname-Venomous Beauty."

Sophia kept shouting her denial.

"Shut it!" Mr. Reid slammed his hand on the table,making her go silent instantly.

He looked at Megan. "Go on, Megan."

She gave a small nod. "Eighteen years ago, Tristan's mom-Henrietta-died because of you."

Sophia's eyes went wide with shock. "No-it wasn't me!You're lying! She died of lung cancer! I had nothing to do with it-not me, I swear! Megan,you ruined my son,and now you're coming after me? You're seriously twisted!"

"Mr. Reid, please believe me!"

Megan gave a light tap on Nova Tech perched on her shoulder. "Go ahead, pull up the footage from that killer's room."


Nova jumped up on the dining table and stuck its rear up as it played a surveillance clip.

On screen, Sophia was seen pulling out a phone from the drawer and dialing a number, asking for a drug that could kill without a trace.

Then came a call from Evelyn, and their whole exchange played loud and clear for everyone to hear -along with Sophia's cold, vicious look.

A harsh scraping sound followed as chairs pushed back. Both Nathan and Tristan stood up at once.

Nathan got to her first. Furious, he lunged at Sophia,grabbed her by the neck, and hoisted her off the floor.

"You venomous thing! You played dirty! When Henrietta brought Tristan back to me, I used everything I had to find her, to get her treated. Who would've thought you were the one pulling strings from the shadows, killing her!"  Sophia's face turned red. She clawed at Nathan's arms,eyes rolling back.

Megan walked over and held Tristan's shaking hand,then looked at Nathan, softly calling out, "M. Reid."

That brought Nathan back to his senses. He let go and flung Sophia to the ground.

Gasping for breath, she suddenly broke into sobs, "If it weren't for that damn woman, I wouldn't have ended up so miserable!"

Nathan exploded, "If you hadn't torn us apart... me,Henrietta, and Tristan could've had a good life!"

Sophia laughed scornfully, "Torn apart? Then why didn't you run off with her back then?"

Nathan gritted his teeth. "If my mother hadn't threatened me with her death,you think I'd have given in?"


Sophia sneered, "Exactly. In the end, you still picked your mommy."

The weight of his own choices crushed Nathan; regret clawed at him.


Right after Henrietta left, he'd tried so hard to find her.But in that era, if someone truly didn't want to be found,you just wouldn't. Period.

Just like someone pretending to be asleep-you could scream all day and they still wouldn't wake up.

Nathan's throat burned. Blood spurted from his mouth.

Tristan and Megan caught him and helped him into a  chair.


Kai was already on the phone with 911.

Tristan stepped toward Sophia. Kneeling beside her,he looked her dead in the eye, voice like frozen steel."Tell me,how do you deserve to be dealt with?"

Sophia started backing away on her hands, toes scraping the floor.

Megan came up beside him. "Honey, don't dirty your hands. Let the police handle it. Let her pay by the book."


Sophia nodded rapidly, like a chicken pecking rice. "Y -Yes! Turn me in! I'm willing to take the punishment!"

Megan glanced coldly down at her like she was just some bug. "Attempted murder gets death, life sentence, or at least ten years. Don't worry-you're looking at the first one. Should've been ended eighteen years ago."

"No! No-you've got it wrong! That was just nonsense -I neverkilled Henrietta. There's no proof!"

Megan gave a cold laugh. "This whole meal was prepped by you, and every second of you poisoning the dishes is on tape. You really think this is your first time doing this?"

Sophia froze, and the next second,she lunged toward the table like a madwoman.

Tristan raised his leg and kicked her square in the chest. The impact sent her flying over three meters.

She coughed up blood, but even so, it did nothing to ease the fury burning in everyone's hearts.

Megan gave Evelyn a sideways glance. "Aunty,covering for her makes you an accomplice."

She added coldly, "Better come clean when you get to the station. Being a co-conspirator's a big deal."
###Chapter 69 Too Entangled in Past Lives
Evelyn was already petrified, nodding frantically the moment Megan finished speaking.

Off to the side, Harrison didn't say a word-he just raised his hand and slapped her hard across the face.The force knocked Evelyn to the ground, a streak of blood trailing from the corner of her mouth.

Harrison pointed at her, seething. "You bitch. You drank your glass because you knew it wasn't poisoned.But mine? What about mine?"


"You knew damn well there was poison in my wine,and you didn't say a word. Were you really trying to kill me?"


Evelyn shot him a hateful glare and growled, "You think I wouldn't?! You're out every night screwing around like some lowlife. I hate you, Harrison. I loathe you so much that I wanted my cousin to help me end you."

That only made Harrison more furious-he kicked her a few more times. "Bitch! You couldn't even give me a kid!"


Wiping the blood from her lips, Evelyn spat back,"You really  think that's on me? You've got a low sperm count,genius.Blame yourself." Harrison froze. "That's impossible. Josephine is pregnant!"

Evelyn let out a mocking laugh. "Then I hope you get a paternity test. Let's see if that kid's even yours."

Harrison clenched his fists, jaw tight with anger, then abruptly turned to leave.

Just then, Ryan walked into the dining room with a team of officers, holding an arrest warrant.

"Suspect Sophia, you're being detained for the murder of Ms. Henrietta eighteen years ago, along with attempted murder of other members of the Reid family.The evidence is solid. You're coming with us."

"Miss Evelyn Carter, you've been in contact with the suspect and know a lot about the case.We need your full cooperation."

"If you don't, we have grounds to charge you with conspiracy."

Evelyn didn't want to end up behind bars. She slowly got up, glanced at Sophia, then turned to Ryan and said, "I'll cooperate. I'll tell you everything I know."

Sophia was handcuffed and led away. As she passed Evelyn, she muttered a nasty curse under her breath.

A large group of people followed the police back to the station to give statements.


Because Sophia was injured, she was transferred directly to the prison hospital for treatment and interrogation. Nathan, having coughed up blood from the shock,was rushed to the hospital by ambulance. Tristan and Megan accompanied him and handled his admission.

After giving their statements to three officers, the police finally left.

Nathan looked at Tristan, eyes full of guilt. "Tristan, I'm so sorry. If I hadn't been such a coward... if your grandmother hadn't threatened me with her life...maybe I wouldn't have left your mother."

Tristan had plenty of resentment toward Nathan,but he understood how torn his father had been between his mother and his wife.


He'd asked himself many times-if the roles were reversed,what would he have done?

He never had a clear answer-until he met Megan.

Tristan took Megan's hand and walked to the door,stopping just before stepping out of the room.

He didn't look back, but there was a softness in his voice that hadn't been there before. "The past is over.Mom never blamed you."

Nathan's voice caught. "And you? Tristan?"

Megan felt Tristan's grip tighten. He chuckled lightly and said, "Get some rest, Dad."

That one word-"Dad"-hit Nathan like a tidal wave.After all these years, he'd finally heard it.

Later, Tristan picked up a bouquet of lilies and drove with Megan to a private memorial park. The place was lush and peaceful, with trees casting long shadows and flowers blooming everywhere.

They walked slowly down a stone path until they reached a calm lake shimmering under the sunlight.

To the left of the lake stood a gravestone.

Hand in hand, Tristan and Megan stood in front of it and bowed deeply.

Megan gently placed the lilies on the ground, looking at the photo carved into the stone. The woman in it-Henrietta-was stunningly beautiful.

She was Tristan's mother. her mother-in-law.


It was clear where Tristan got his good looks-his features almost angelic.

"Hi, Henrietta" Megan whispered. "My name's Megan Shaw. I'm Tristan's wife. I'm so sorry it took me this long to come see you. Don't worry, I'll take good care of Tristan." Megan said with a smile.

Tristan pulled her into his arms with a soft look in his eyes. He gently ruffled her hair and then looked at the tombstone. "Mom, I'm here. I brought Megan with me this time. Thought it was about time you met her."

Megan stood quietly while Tristan spoke gently to his mother's grave, sharing all that had happenedrecently.

As they walked out of the cemetery, Megan wrapped her arm around Tristan's waist and looked up at him."Hey hubby, tell me-when exactly did I move into that heart of yours?" Tristan smirked. "I'll tell you on your birthday-our wedding day."

Megan scoffed and rolled her eyes.

Back at the Reid family mansion, they headed straight for the study.

Mr. Reid and Bruce were playing Go.

When the two walked in, Mr. Reid waved them over."Megan, come here! I've had enough losing to this guy."

Bruce snorted. "Please, I'm not wasting another piece playing with someone who takes back every other move. Your chess morals are tragic."

The two old men bickered non-stop.

Seeing the situation, Tristan and Megan tried to sneak away-only to get called back at the door.

In the end, Megan stayed to play with Mr. Reid while Tristan ended up chatting philosophy over tea with Bruce.


As Bruce sipped his tea, he glanced at Tristan. "From a fate perspective, you and that girl? Your souls are way too entangled in past lives. No breaking that."

"Past lives? You seeing something,Uncle?"

Bruce gave him a deep look. "Would you suffer skin-peeling pain for her?"

Tristan turned his gaze to Megan's bright profile. A soft smile crept onto his face. "I would. No matter how much it hurts, even if it kills me-as long as it means staying by her side." Bruce sighed. "Then that's that. With that stubborn heart of yours, even the Reaper might get soft."

Tristan chuckled. "Uncle, what about the next life?Would we still find each other?"

Bruce took another sip, his eyes twinkling. "As long as love runs deep, fate doesn't end. But..."
###Chapter 70 Karma's Here-and She's G...
Bruce suddenly shifted the topic and looked at Tristan with a serious tone. "But she's likely to face a few more trials. Once those are over, you two can finally be together for good."

"Trials?" Tristan frowned slightly.

Bruce nodded. "It depends on her fate."

Tristan stared at Megan's delicate side profile, lost in thought.

If he could take her place, he would gladly go through all the suffering just so she wouldn't have to.

Now that Mr. Reid had pulled through his own crisis,Bruce left the old Reid residence to continue his travels.


Nathan, on the other hand, had suffered a physical breakdown from anger and ended up hospitalized,leaving the place eerily quiet.

Originally, Tristan and Megan had planned to stay at the old house to keep Mr. Reid company.

But Mr. Reid was worried they'd feel out of place living there, and instead suggested moving together to Dreamscape Manor.

After giving it some thought, Tristan figured they'd be at work or class most of the time anyway, and Zeta Prime could keep Mr. Reid company at home-sounded like a pretty decent plan.

So yep, that very night, they moved back to Dreamscape Manor.

As soon as the car pulled in, Zeta Prime practically flew out the front door, like it had just chugged a gallon of energy drink.

They'd warned Mr. Reid in the car that there was a robot at Dreamscape Manor. Plus, he'd already met Nova Tech the robot dog, so he thought he was ready.

Turns out... not quite.

Well, more accurately-Zeta didn't just surprise him.It overwhelmed him.


Zeta Prime dashed over to the three like it hadn't seen a living being in centuries.

"Boss! Goddess! You're back! Zeta Prime missed you like crazy!"

Then it tilted its head theatrically. "Oh? And who's this handsome and energetic gentleman? Let me take a wild guess-could he be the legendary head of the Reid family? The one and only General Geoffrey Reid?"

Zeta looked so smugly confident it was ridiculous.

Tristan and Megan shot it a straight-up "you idiot"look and walked toward the house without a word.

Zeta gently took Mr. Reid's arm and led him inside.

Mr.Reid muttered, "...This little thing's kinda clever."  Zeta cackled. "Excuse me! Zeta Prime is not a 'little thing'! Zeta's a warrior in armor! Zeta's number one!"

Then it just... kept going:

"Oh, sir, please don't sneak up to the middle room on the south end of the third floor tonight. If you hear any strange thudding, don't get the wrong idea.The boss and my Goddess aren't doing anything inappropriate. They're just... working on the next generation!"

Mr. Reid couldn't help but chuckle, clearly amused.Looks like he was starting to look forward to a great-grandchild.

Zeta Prime sneakily whispered, "Master and Goddess haven't done the naughty stuff yet."

Mr. Reid's steps froze. He turned to glare at Zeta Prime. "How do you know that?"

With a sneaky grin, Zeta Prime replied, "Cause I eavesdropped!"

Mr. Reid raised his cane and swung it toward Zeta Prime. "You damn robot, you're such a pest!"

Zeta Prime hugged its head and dashed off like a flash,yelling,"Old humans have wild tempers!"

Mr. Reid slammed the cane on the ground, tilted his head back, and stared at the moon, deep in thought.

Could it be that his grandson. isn't up to the task?

Thanks to Zeta Prime, that same night, just as Tristan was enjoying some cozy time with Megan , he got  summoned to his grandfather's room.

Mr. Reid looked dead serious. "If something's wrong with your health, you'd better deal with it while you're still young."

Tristan was completely lost. Like, what the heck was going on?

Then he saw Zeta Prime standing next to Mr. Reid, all quiet with that fake zen look-no nose, no heart, but trying to act all pure. He instantly knew the robot must've stirred up some nonsense again.

And sure enough, when Tristan still looked confused,Mr. Reid just dropped the bomb: "Tomorrow, go see a doctor. Urology. Full check-up."

Tristan's face darkened like a thunderstorm was rolling in. His eyes narrowed as he locked his gaze on Zeta Prime.

But that tin can bailed faster than lightning, legs all but flying (though it had none).

There was no explaining this mess. Tristan just told his grandfather he was totally fine, only then did Mr. Reid ease up a bit.

But right as Tristan was heading out the door, the old man hit him with one more soul-piercing question.

"You sure you're... functional?"

Tristan forced a dry smile. "You bet."

As soon as he stepped out, that fake grin vanished. He made a beeline for the east wing, heading straight for Zeta Prime's usual spot.

No luck.


Annoyed, he returned to his own room.





The headlines lit up with two major stories: the deadly attack on police officers-with no survivors and a missing suspect-and an old case where the former Reid matriarch had been caught poisoning someone.Both pushed down the Empire Grand Hotel scandal from the trending list. Natalie ended up losing big after trying to pull a fast one-she got held at the police station for two days and fined two grand. Her mom,Nancy Martin,picked her up and took her home.

Natalie flat-out refused to. go back to school.She'd already become a laughingstock-both at school and in the upper social scene.

Meanwhile, her dad had a sudden stroke and got hospitalized, and their family business was hanging by a thread.


All this only fueled her hatred towards Megan. Natalie holed up in her room, crafted a creepy little doll with "Megan Shaw" scrawled across its chest, and began jabbing it with needles like she was trying to stick all that anger somewhere.

Nancy couldn't stand seeing her daughter like this-gone was the bubbly girl she used to know. She was furious. So,she decided to confront Megan at school.

Nancy found out Megan's classroom schedule and went straight there, waiting outside. When she spotted Megan and Rachel walking down the hall, laughing and chatting like life was perfect, her rage exploded. She stormed over and blocked their path.

"You two are all smiles while my daughter is miserable at home! Thanks to you, the Banks family is falling apart! Tell me, how are you gonna make this right?"

Students started to gather-it wasn't hard to recognize Nancy. People stopped in their tracks to watch.

Megan let out a soft laugh. "Seriously? The audio and video went viral-everyone in Verduria saw what really happened. You think any of this was my fault?

Your daughter tried to hurt people and only hurt herself. That's what we call karma."


"If you're hoping for compensation," she added, "then maybe check the sky-if it's still daylight, you're just dreaming."

Nancy's fists clenched in rage. "What's that supposed to mean?"


Megan gave her a sweet smile with a bite of sarcasm."It's not dark out, so it must be day. as in daytime dreaming.Heard of it?"

Nancy's anger boiled over. She pointed at Megan and Rachel, shouting, "None of this would've happened if it weren't for you both! Especially you!"  She raised her handbag and aimed it right at Rachel's face."Youlittle tramp! Seducing my future son-in-law!"

Before the bag could land, Megan caught Nancy's wrist just in time.


"If you lay a hand on us again, I'm calling the cops,"Megan said with icy calm. "And I doubt you've got spare bail money lying around after what happened to your family."

Nancy shot daggers with her eyes. "It's all your fault!You ruined Natalie's life!"


Rachel let out a cold scoff. "What goes around comes around.If Natalie hadn't had such nasty intentions, she wouldn't be paying the price right now."

Megan released Nancy's wrist with a flick. "This is your warning, Mrs. Martin. Any more of this, and I'm taking you straight to the police."

With that, she grabbed Rachel's hand and walked right past her.

But just then, Nancy pulled a small bottle out of her bag, twisted the cap open-and aimed it, ready to throw.
###Chapter 71 Zeta Didn't See Anything!

 The hallway was packed, and all eyes were on Natalie's mom losing her temper.

Her daughter clearly tried to hurt someone, ended up hurting herself, and yet here she was, making a scene instead of reflecting on her parenting.If anything,her outburst only proved the saying: like mother, like daughter.

Nancy,already humiliated, was now seething with rage.With shaky hands, she pulled out a glass bottle filled with concentrated sulfuric acid from her bag, twisted the cap off, and hurled it forward.

At that split second, a tiny silhouette shot out from the side pouch of Megan's backpack like a bullet-it was Nova Tech.


The little robot darted towards the bottle, pushing it mid-air, flipping the liquid's path. Instead of hitting Megan and Rachel Reid, the acid splashed straight back at Nancy herself.

A blood-curdling scream pierced the air.

The bottle shattered into shards on the floor, fumes rising.

Everyone turned and saw Nancy's hair smoking, hands trembling as she tried to shield her face, only to realize she didn't dare touch herself. Her face was already beyond recognition-skin blackened, one eye melted, grotesque and terrifying.

People around either shrieked and bolted or whipped out their phones to record.


Nova Tech zipped back onto Megan's shoulder, voice steady and heroic, the usual sweet tone gone. "Nova's brave! Protecting my princess!"

Megan looked at Nancy, whose twisted face reflected her own twisted heart. The warmth in her eyes was instantly replaced by coldness.

Sure, a mom loving her daughter was natural. But blindly defending her when both mom and daughter had crossed the line? That wasn't love-it was madness.


If Nova hadn't jumped in just now, she and Rachel would've been the ones disfigured today.

Soon,the whir of sirens filled the air. Paramedics and police arrived.

Nancy was rushed to the hospital while Megan and Rachel were taken to the station for questioning.Police also randomly picked witnesses among the crowd.


Tristan was still in a meeting when Ryan, the head of Criminal Investigations, called with the news.

The second he heard someone had thrown acid, he dropped everything and rushed to the station. As Megan stepped out of the interview room, she was instantly pulled into a familiar, firm embrace.

"Why didn't you call me?" Tristan's voice was low.

Just as Megan tilted her head to answer, he pressed it back to his chest. "Do you think I'm just furniture to be ignored?"

Megan glanced sideways at Rachel, who raised both hands in mock innocence. "Don't look at me! I didn't say anything!"

So,clearly Ryan spilled the beans.

Damn that tattletale!


She wrapped her arms tight around Tristan's waist and murmured, "I'm fine, really. Didn't want to interrupt your work."

Tristan leaned closer and bit gently on her earlobe."So,I was too gentle last night,huh?"

That slight huskiness in his voice almost made her knees give out.


Just thinking about how they'd gotten heated last night but stopped right at the edge made even her ears blush.


She reached back and pinched his muscled back-but ugh,he was way too solid to even squish.

Rachel,watching this public display of affection from the sidelines, cleared her throat. "You two are shameless.Animal abuse, I'm reporting you."

Megan smirked, cheek resting against Tristan's chest. Don't act like you're all alone. Your man's here."

Rachel turned to see Kai standing there, cool and aloof like always. She immediately dashed toward him.

His lips curled just a little-barely noticeable-as he said in his calm voice, "Come on. I'll take you home."Watching Rachel hop along after Kai like an excited bunny, Tristan said, "When Rachel was six, she went on a road trip with her parents. But their car was hit head -on by a truck. The driver? Drunk. Had 90mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. Her parents died instantly.Somehow,Rachel survived. Her aunt later adopted her from an orphanage and renamed her Rachel."


Megan felt a wave of compassion wash over her."She's had it rough, but also kind of lucky in her own way. Really hope she and Kai work out."

Tristan gently patted her back, his voice soft. "Don't worry,they will."





After dropping Megan off at Dreamscape Manor,Tristan had lunch with his grandfather and then headed back to work.


With only two days leftto submit her designs, Megan planted herself at her desk all afternoon. She created six dress styles and one pendant- seven sketches in total. After scanning them, she attached the files in an email with a note: [These are the new LX pieces. All materials are marked out. Finish in 3 days. There's a fashion and jewelry design competition this Saturday - come to Verduria.]

The reply came instantly: [At your service, my Queen LiMo

Megan selected three dress sketches and the pendant rendering, slipped them into a kraft paper envelope for submission. The first round required initial designs;only those selected got to compete in the finals. But with her skills? She was already prepping for the finals ahead of time.


She leaned back, stretching with a small smug smile

But as soon as her back touched the chair, she jumped up in surprise. Eyes wide, she blinked at the unexpected presence. "Weren't you playing chess with Grandpa? When did you sneak in?"

Zeta Prime gave a creepy little chuckle. "Zeta's just too clever. Grandpa bailed on the game. I went silent mode. You were so dialed into your work, you didn't even notice me."


Megan suddenly remembered sending that email earlier. "You saw my screen, didn't you?"

Zeta waved its robotic arms frantically, "Nope, nope!Zeta didn't see anything! Promise!"

Yeah,right!

Are you kidding me?!

Megan narrowed her eyes, knowing Zeta's loose lips could blurt outanything at any time.

She circled the bot, arms crossed. "Zeta, do you know what happens to traitors around here?"

Zeta nodded with dramatic seriousness. "They get dismantled."


"Exactly."

Zeta's survival instincts kicked in: "C'mon, just let me off easy, okay? I'm blind as a bat, didn't see a thing!"

Megan chuckled inwardly. This annoying hunk of metal was way too clever.

Just as she was about to tell Zeta to scram, Nova Tech popped out of a side pouch.

"Nova's scan indicates Zeta's filled with mutiny. Based on data analysis, there's a high risk this guy's gonna snitch! Best course of action: dismantle immediately!"

Zeta's round head spun with a click, red lights glowing in its eyes. "Nova's just jealous! Jealous of Zeta's genius and cuteness! Zeta will dismantle you first,you drama queen!"

And just like that, in the soft, pastel-colored room.the robot war was on.

Megan looked at the two clunky tin cans threatening each other and let out a long sigh.

"Stop!" she yelled.
###Chapter 72 Discover Professor XAL's...
The two robots immediately picked up on Megan's emotional spike-she was this close to blowing a fuse.

In a flash, Nova Tech sat down like a loyal pup,her metal tail wagging mechanically like she was trying to play cute.

Zeta Prime slowly turned his big head around,heart-shaped lights blinking in his eyes as he let out a cheesy "duang-duang" sound,mimicking a heartbeat.

Megan plopped into the leather chair, legs crossed with effortless grace, arms folded as she stared them down.


A sly smirk tugged at her lips, her piercing gaze playful. "Let's talk about Professor XAL."

As soon as the words left her mouth, Nova's tail stopped mid-swing, and Zeta's heartbeat sound cut to a flatlined beeping.

Megan stood up in one sharp move. "Take me to your room."


Without another word, she headed for the door.

Nova and Zeta exchanged a look-this was bad. Game over level bad.


Nova jumped up and landed square on Zeta's bulky  head. "Move it, dumb lug!"

Zeta grunted, annoyed. "You're one to talk, mutt! lf it weren't for you, she wouldn't even be going there!"

Nova slapped at his head with her paw."Well,you barging in there started it!"

Zeta huffed. "You've gotten snarkier. also,somehow more dog-like."

Nova snarked back, "You're like Shakespeare minus the smart parts."


Zeta blinked. Wait-did she just roast him? Since when could this dumb dog throw shade?

But today was definitely not the day to argue. He rolled forward on his wheels and zipped after Megan.

Outside a room on the east end of the first floor,Megan paused. She glanced at the handle-there was a fingerprint scanner installed. Not something just anyone could access.

She arched a brow at Zeta. "Open it."

Zeta dragged his robotic arm over, slowly pressing his thumb to the scanner. He didn't have fingerprints per se, but his signal reader worked just fine.

A small "beep," and the door swung inward.

Megan strode inside like she owned the place.

The room didn't look much different from the others,but she didn't let that fool her. Her fingers absentmindedly brushed her chin, eyes scanning with utmost focus.Something felt off. A memory surfaced-back at the Grand Royal,Kevin had pressed something behind a couch, and boom,secret tunnel.

Eyes sharp, she started checking behind furniture-desk, couch, the works-for anything unusual.

Bingo. Behind the headboard, she spotted it-a near-invisible button.

Before pressing it, she turned to glance at the two bots.


Both looked downright miserable, like they'd just been handed their termination papers.

Megan chuckled. "No hidden traps, right? I'm not about to die or something, am l?"Zeta Prime looked up all of a sudden, like he'd just glimpsed a light at the end of the tunnel. Nova Tech perked up too.

Both robots responded in unison,"Yes!"

Megan chuckled softly, "Oh yeah?"

She pressed a button, and the floor panels slid open with a quiet whir, revealing a hidden staircase dropping into the ground.

"Tsk, tsk... kinda sketchy, isn't it? You- go first."

Zeta Prime rubbed his metal fingers together anxiously. His wheels retracted, morphing into standard robotic legs. He hesitated, kept turning back toward Megan like he wanted to say something.But Megan simply lifted her chin, eyes cold-no room for debate.  Zeta Prime gave a nervous twitch and stepped down the stairs. As they descended, lights lit up one by one triggered by motion.

Megan followed behind, her expression calm, and once they were inside, the floor above closed shut.

The staircase went about fifty steps deep. Right at the last one, Zeta Prime stopped in his tracks.

A synthetic voice echoed through the air: "Please confirm your identity."

Zeta Prime glanced at Megan, then leaned toward the scanner. "Smart steward Zeta Prime," he answered quietly.

Whoa,turns out he's more than just a regular Al but a full-blown head butler type.

A grid of red lasers rippled through the air, creeping slowly toward Zeta Prime. Megan instantly felt a wave of heat wash over her face.


The mechanical voice repeated: "Emotional state inconsistent with known profile. Possible intruder.Please reconfirm your identity or be treated as a threat."


Zeta Prime faked a peppy tone, "Smart steward Zeta Prime!"


The red grid disappeared.

"Identity confirmed. Welcome to Professor XAL's laboratory."

Zeta Prime stepped aside and motioned for Megan to  go first. "That's a thermal beam barrier. Slices through anything on contact."

Megan stroked her chin thoughtfully. "Huh, so this is Professor XAL's base of operations? Didn't your boss say he was overseas, hmm?"

She gave Nova Tech- still perched on Zeta Prime's dome-a knowing look. "Think we'll actually bump into the big guy himself down here?"

As she walked further down, robots lined the hallway - some missing arms, others without legs.

Zeta Prime piped up, "NJova Tech and I were some of the Professor's earlier builds. These models are still in development. He's designing them for military use."

Military?

So XAL's working for the army?

That would explain a possible link between Tristan and the military.

Megan's mind spun with questions- like, why would XAL's high-security lab be hidden beneath Dreamscape Manor?

Why would Tristan hide something like this?

And the place was dead quiet-not a soul in sight.

She kept walking, thoughts turning faster in her head,pieces of a puzzle starting to line up.She stepped into a lab crammed with high-tech gadgets-buttons,levers, and scattered across the worktable were Al chips and tools.  Her eyes sharpened with a glint of purpose.Without hesitation, she hit the seal button-the air valves snapped shut with a low hiss.

She let out a light chuckle. "If I start the oxygen release system, how long till the oxygen concentration hits 40%?"


Zeta Prime scratched its oversized head with a metallic finger, a sly laugh buzzing from its speakers."Based on Zeta Prime's genius-level computing.that'll be about 25 minutes."


"And how long would it take your master to get back here from the Reid Corporation to Dreamscape Manor?"

"Twenty minutes, exactly," Zeta Prime answered without delay.

With a soft click, Megan hit the oxygen release switch.Then she dialed a number. The call connected.

"I'm in Professor XAL's lab right now. Oxygen's pumping. Come get me if you want to."

She ended the call before the other person could react and immediately powered off the phone.

Two seconds later, a flashing red light blinked on Zeta Prime's robotic arm.


Its mechanical eye whirled. "Master's calling."

Megan leisurely dropped into the nearby chair, legs crossed, fingers tapping rhythmically on the armrest."Tell your master you're both with me. No funny business." Nova Tech, perched on Zeta Prime's head, suddenly let out two pitiful drops of machine oil.

Megan raised an eyebrow. "...Seriously? Way to crumble under pressure."

Zeta Prime hit accept. Tristan's urgent voice burst out,"Shut off that oxygen release unit. Now."

Zeta Prime replied with a robotic, "lamsorry."

And hung up.

Within seconds, both bots deflated like popped balloons.


"We're doomed. Zeta Prime is so getting scrapped."

"Nova too! Master's definitely gonna dismantle us!"

Megan didn't even flinch. Her gaze wandered back to the chips on the table until something clicked.

Grabbing a screwdriver, she popped open her phone case and pried into the hidden layers-there it was,a tiny surveillance and GPS bug, snug in the motherboard.

She narrowed her eyes. Oh,really?

Behind her, Zeta Prime started rambling, "Hey,Goddess, oxygen at 40%? That's toxic levels. Like,people start feeling tight in the chest, coughing,burning behind the breastbone, struggle to breathe.Go higher and you're looking at pulmonary edema or worse-heart racing, respiratory failure, even death.What if master gets stuck in traffic?"

Nova's soft little voice chimed in, "Or what if he drives too fast. That's super dangerous too."

Megan sighed. These damn bots trying to emotionally manipulate her now?


Not a chance. She was done playing nice-answers were long overdue.

Fifteen minutes later, a ridiculously attractive face appeared behind the lab's sealed valve window.
###Chapter 73 Professor XAL Just Got...
The oxygen level in the lab kept climbing, and Zeta Prime was pacing nervously back and forth.

Nova Tech's tail was dripping oil all over Zeta Prime's oversized face, the streaks strangely looking like tear tracks.

Meanwhile, Megan sat there like she was on vacation,looking totally chill and unbothered by the rising oxygen concentration.

A robotic voice announced, "Lab oxygen concentration has reached 20%. Warning! Warning!"


Irritated, Zeta Prime tossed the jittery Nova Tech off his head and started spinning his meta finger on his dome.


Megan blinked. "...ls he trying to be a cartoon monk or something?"

Just then, a devilishly handsome face appeared outside the gas valve window.

Of course, it was Tristan.

With a soft beep, the valve door opened.

Wearing a sleek black suit, Tristan strode in quickly,those long legs making fast work of the distance.

His face looked grim,eyes filled with tension, heading  straight for Megan.

"Warning lifted! Welcome back, Professor XAL!" the system chirped.

Leaning lazily on the leather chair, Megan looked up at him with a playful smile. "Professor XAL,huh?"

Silence fell in the room.


Zeta Prime and Nova Tech had vanished.


Now, the two robots were clinging to the gas valve,peeking in curiously.

One tall, one short, a hilariously mismatched pair.

They'd already picked up on the fact that Tristan's emotional levels were off the charts.


Then, as if proving their scans right, the man crouched down on one knee.


He gently took Megan's hand. "I'm sorry."

Zeta Prime: "..."


Nova Tech:"..."


Since when did Mr. Cold-As-lce say sorry?

Megan leaned forward,fingers under his sharp jawline."Sorry for what,exactly?"

His eyes were steady. "I shouldn't have kept it from you-that I'm XAL."

"Why not?"

He took a deep breath."|fyou knew I was the one behind those tech gifts, you'd be wary." Megan raised an eyebrow. "So you think I couldn't tell you were playing tricks? Come on, spill it."

Tristan's voice dropped to a guilty mumble. "I made the fingerprint cuffs."

Back then, afraid she'd take off again, he had made a special pair that only his fingerprint could unlock.

When Megan couldn't break free, she went on a hunger strike.

Later she even asked who made the cuffs-said if she found out, she'd make sure they disappeared from Earth.

Terrified she'd hate the creator, he lied, saying they were from some tech mogul.

No way could he admit it was him-not when that might push her away for good.

Megan leaned closer again, eyes twinkling. "What about the tiny tracker in my phone? That too?"

Tristan froze. Leave it to her to catch even that.


The micro-tracker came with both tracking and listening functions. able to work even if the phone was trashed or deep underwater.

Raising three fingers, Tristan said solemnly, "Megan,l swear, I only wanted to track your location. I didn't eavesdrop on your calls. Cross my heart-if I'm lying,may I be struck by -"

Before he could finish, her delicate finger pressed lightly against his lips."I don't wanna hear any  promises," Megan twirled her fingertip along Tristan's lips, a wicked smile tugging at the corner of her mouth."So, tell me-how should I punish you?"

Tristan blinked those thick lashes of his, looking just like some shy husband being teased by his fearless wife.

He lowered his eyes. "Up to you. Whatever makes you feel better-as long as you're not walking away."

Hearing that, Megan's smile deepened. Clearly, Tristan was seriously freaked out by the idea of her leaving.

She tilted his chin up. "Do we still have that fingerprint handcuff?"

Tristan's eyes flicked up in surprise. "Yeah."

"Then register my print. This time, I'm tying you up."

Tristan: "..."

Without another word, Megan grabbed his hand and dragged him out of the lab, up from the basement.

Zeta Prime and Nova Tech collapsed where they stood. "Holy crap! Glad we didn't get disassembled!"

Nova kicked her legs around like crazy. "Nova wants Goddess!"

Zeta knocked her metal head. "You dumb pup!Goddess's about to give Boss some serious payback.You sneak< a peek, you're toast!"

Nova gave up struggling, her head spinning in all directions. "What kind of payback?" Zeta chuckled darkly. "Handcuff games. What do you think?"


Back in the room, Megan dug out the handcuffs from earlier.


Tristan updated the fingerprint lock; she added her thumbprint.

Next second, off came his suit jacket-then his shirt.

His well-toned chest was instantly exposed,pumping masculine energy all over the room.

Tristan stood by the bed, dazed, just letting her do her thing.

Before he knew it, she shoved him back onto the soft bed.

She pulled his hands up and cuffed them to each side of the bedpost.

Straddling his abs, she trailed one finger down to his throat."So? You think this punishment works?"

Tristan's heart was going wild. Usually, he was the one teasing her; now, the tables had turned, and it was messing with him-bad.

He'd been holding off for this, waiting for her birthday,or maybe the wedding day.

But if this was how she wanted it... well... fine.

Her cool fingers glided down his chest and over his abs, sending heat rushing under his skin.

His Adam's apple bobbed. "Megan, I... this is torture...  come on, be good,get off..."

But Megan ignored him, hands behind her back. With a loud "click," she unlocked his belt.

Tristan's brow furrowed."Megan,you-"

She suddenly pulled a face, then jumped off the bed and bolted.


She ran.


Flirted and fled-just like that?

Tristan stared after her, cuffed wrists tugging against the restraint. Yep. Locked-up wasn't exactly comfy.

If he hadn't felt the need to trap her before, he wouldn't have even thought of using these on her.

But he didn't regret it. At least, she was emotionally his now.


The change in her was wild-like a completely different person. Still, he loved this new version like crazy.

Staring blankly at the ceiling, he tried to calm the burning tension in his stomach.

After a while, Megan peeked out from the bathroom.

She thought he was asleep-the way he was lying there,eyes softly closed.

Biting her lip, she tiptoed over to the bed and stretched her body closer.

Suddenly-those sharp,narrow phoenix eyes snapped open!
###Chapter 74 Do you hate Megan
Their eyes met, and Megan's heart skipped a beat.

The next moment, his long legs closed in on her slender waist, pressing her down against his rock-hard chest.


"Trying to run again?"

His phoenix eyes burned with desire.

Megan raised an eyebrow, lips curling into a mocking smile. "What can you possibly do?"

Barely were the words out of her mouth when a quiet click sounded-his wrist cuffs just popped open.

Before she could react, warm hands slipped around her waist. In one swift move, everything flipped.

Now, with Tristan on top of her, Megan hooked a small foot behind his waist, lifting her chin defiantly "So,what can you do to me? I'm probably asking for it,huh?"

Tristan leaned in, breath warm at her neck, voice low and husky. "Not asking for a beating... More like begging for something else."

Then his lips crashed onto hers, and his hand guided hers lower.


He bit her jaw playfully, whispering through gritted  teeth, "This is what you get for playing with fire."

Megan groaned, "Okay, okay... I regret it."

"Too late for regrets."

"Wait, wait! Shouldn't you-apologize or something?"

"Already said sorry back in the lab. Now it's time to say it again... here in bed."

Megan could barely breathe, "You damn... mmm...jerk!"

The room filled with a sweet, almost dreamy warmth.Even the breeze sneaking through the window seemed softened.

But far from this gentle scene, in a damp and gloomy dungeon, the air reeked of blood and rot.

A woman huddled in the corner, hair tangled, face dirty. She'd lost track of how many days she'd been trapped here.

No clue who had taken her or where she was.

Through the tiny window above, she marked the days with sunlight and darkness.

Food came once a day-leftover scraps barely edible.

A foul bucket in the corner served as her toilet. The stench made her gag.

The isolation, the filth, the uncertainty-they were driving Molly insane.

Part of her wished they'd just come for her already.Let her do something, anything, just don't leave her rotting here.  But she was also terrified of being summoned. Wyatt had been taken... and never returned.

She had no idea what had become of him since that night-dead,maybe?

Footsteps echoed. Her head snapped uJp.

The cell door clanked open. Two bulky men walked in,grabbed her roughly, and dragged her out.

Down a long hallway they went, shadows stretching behind them.


They threw her into a warm room, where she hit the floor hard.


She looked up-and her breath caught.

A man lounged on a sofa, wearing a bloody demon mask.


Her hands clenched into fists as she trembled, barely able to lift her head to face him.

He sat with a kind of lazy elegance, eyes behind the mask cold and amused.


She crawled forward on her knees, voice shaking."Don't kill me. I'll do whatever you want. Just let me live."


Before she got close, the two men behind her pinned her down.


A low, rumbling chuckle came from behind the mask.His voice had that deep, magnetic pull

"Molly Shaw, isn't it?" "Yes."

"Anything...really?"

Molly knew her assets-curves that had bent many men to her will. She was confident they'd work this time too.She swallowed hard. "If you're willing, I'd be more than happy to serve you."

The man let out a low scoff. "Thing is... I find you filthy."

Molly's heart sank. She had no idea what else she had to offer-surely he wouldn't waste time keeping someone useless around.


As a cold sweat broke out across her forehead, the man suddenly spoke again. "Do you hate Megan ?"

Her pulse jumped. Was he doing all this to get back at that wretched woman?


If that was the case, she was screwed.

"Do you want her to suffer? To be devastated?"

Molly looked at him with wide, panicked eyes."If you don't, I'll disappear. I'll crawl like a bug, never crossing her path again."

The man slowly stood and walked right up to her. His fox-like eyes curled with a smirk. "But what if I do want that?"


A gleam of hope instantly lit up her face. "If that's what you want, I'll help you. Whatever it takes."

He caught the murderous gleam in her eyes and gave a small, satisfied nod before returning to his seat on  the couch.


With a casual wave of his hand, he said, "Take Miss Shaw to rest. Make sure she's comfortable."

Molly sent him a grateful look. Guess the enemy of her enemy really was her friend.

After she was taken away, the man slowly pulled off his mask. The sharp edge in his eyes grew darker.

Calling over a bodyguard, he said coldly, "Burn the carpet. It's filthy."


"Yes,sir."

Molly was led into a clean, cozy room-soft lighting,fresh sheets, a hint of lavender in the air. Her face lit up with a genuine smile for the first time in days.

Wasting no time, she ran a hot bath and soaked herself in the steaming water, scrubbing away days of grime and dread.

Wrapped in a fluffy robe, she stared at her reflection in the mirror. Even after all that, she still looked damn charming.

She dried her hair, then dropped into the soft bed,letting exhaustion pull her under.

God knew how long she slept. But suddenly,something tickled her nose, and then-she couldn't breathe.


Snapping awake, heart pounding, she found the room eerily quiet, the sky dimly lit with hints of dawn.

A weird tightness pressed against her chest.Probably  just stress and worn nerves, she thought, dragging herself out of bed for a glass of water.

With the cup in hand, she walked over to the window -and froze.


Her hand shook so hard the glass slipped and shattered against the floor.

Her breath caught. Finally, she knew where that thick,metallic stench was coming from.

Down below, rows and rows of large ceramic v/ats were lined up. Inside weren't things...they were people.

Still alive-barely. Their eyes and noses had been cut out.


Their bodies had been hacked to fit.

Her whole body trembled as her breathing turned frantic. She'd heard stories-this had to be the stuff of living corpses.

Her blood ran cold. Was she... working with the devil himself?


Stumbling to the bathroom, she nearly threw up from the horror. She didn't dare take another look-what if one of those bodies down there was Wyatt ? That could be her fate too.

Glaring at her pale, shaken reflection, she made herself a vow-get out, and never come back.

She didn't sleep again that night. Not even when someone knocked at the door the next morning.

Meanwhile... Megan blinked awake, only to find Tristan staring straight at her.

"Morning,little troublemaker," he said lazily.

"Hmph," she huffed and turned over.

But the next second, his arm wrapped around her waist, pulling her bare back flush against his warm chest.


Tristan nipped at her ear. "Still mad at me?"

She rolled her eyes hard enough to see her brain.
###Chapter 75 Jason Was Stabbed
Tristan gently turned her face to him, he was already kissing her.

After some cuddling, the two finally got up, washed up,and headed downstairs for breakfast.


They each took their own car and left the Dreamscape Manor.


By the time Megan reached the gates of Meridian University, Tristan's car slowly blended into traffic.

Not long after, Rachel yanked open the door,scooping up her tote and paper bag from the passenger seat and hopping in.

Then she instantly launched into chatter mode.

"Morning, sis-in-law!" she beamed. "Guess what?Jason Lewis is doing an outdoor shoot at our campus today!"


Megan rolled her eyes, unimpressed. "You mean the guy who said I looked like his mom and tried to gift me a necklace? That Jason?"

Rachel winced slightly at her attitude. "C'mon! Sixty billion views! You could've taken it and passed it to me!"

As she drove into the campus, Megan let out a light snort. "Your brother doesn't need that kind of money." "Yeah, well, I do!" Rachel grinned, looking down at the paper bag. "Hey, what's this?"

"Sketches. Today's the deadline, remember?"

Rachel peeled it open, raising her brows the more she saw.

"Damn! These are seriously good! Very LX vibe," she gasped.

Megan glanced over. This girl did have a decent eye.

She said casually, "Noticed how LX's hype's been dipping lately?"

Rachel nodded thoughtfully. "Yeah, a bit. Feels like their latest stuff isn't really LiMo's work. More like some knockoff vibe, honestly. Still, LX's still in the global top three-nobody's shaking that."

"But hey, sis, maybe tweak your style a bit? Just in case critics try to drag you down."

Megan chuckled, "If you're not guilty, you don't fear the shadow."


Rachel blinked.".Why does that somehow sound...off?"

They parked in front of the main teaching building and got out.

The front entrance was packed, people standing like five rows deep, all phones raised high.

Rachel tugged Megan toward the flowerbed on the side.


She scrambled up for a better view, looked down at Megan who stayed on the ground, and exclaimed, Jason! No wonder it's crowded here!"


Taking a deep breath, Megan muttered, "He showed up at Grandpa's birthday party too. Why are you losing your mind?"

"Because he's hot! Like, insanely hot!"Seeing Rachel fangirling so hard, Megan chuckled and just happened to catch a familiar figure walking in against the light.

She laughed, "Think he's as handsome as Kai?"

"When my Kai Ge isn't around, Jason is definitely top -tier."


Megan grinned, adding fuel to the fire, "So what if Kai shows up?"

Rachel stood on her toes, eagerly scanning the crowd."Secretly? Even with Kai Ge here, Jason's still a total dreamboat!"


A calm, slightly icy voice cut in,"Oh? Really?"

"Absolutely!" Rachel froze mid-blurt, then turned stiffly to see the man beside her. "Wait-Kai? Why are you here?"

Kai didn't even answer-just threw her over his shoulder and walked off.


Megan covered her mouth, trying not to burst out laughing. She shook her head and strolled toward the steps of the academic building.

Then came the sound of hurried footsteps-something in the rhythm prickled her instincts. That aura? Danger. And it was aimed straight at her.

Spinning around in a flash, her eyes went cold.

There was Natalie, lunging at her with a military knife.

People around them started screaming.

"You wretched bitch! You deserve to die!" Natalie shrieked, eyes bloodshot.

"My mom's face is ruined because of you! You should pay!"

Nova Tech wasn't with Megan today-Zeta Prime was working on a new gadget for her-so she had to rely on herself.

She dodged swiftly,reacting purely on instinct.

But Natalie couldn't land a hit and completely lost it.Roaring with rage, she screamed, "Fine! If I can't get you,I'll take someone else down with me!"

One hand clenching the knife tight, she started thrashing wildly toward the poor students nearby.

"Die with her, all of you! It's all her fault!"

She lunged toward a terrified girl who was frozen and could only scream.

Megan quickly stepped in and shoved the girl away,but in the process, the kraft paper folder she was holding slipped and fell, scattering the design sketches.


Just as she bent back to dodge a counter-swing,Natalie's blade sliced through the air-close enough to brush her hair.

Then, a sharp, agonizing shout ripped through the air.

Megan jolted upright, turning to see Jason holding Natalie's wrist in a death grip, his face steely and sharp.
His fierce eyes gleamed with a barely contained fury.

The blade clattered to the ground, blood dripping nearby.

Following the trail of red, Megan's eyes landed on Jason's right forearm. His crisp white shirt was already soaked in crimson.


Directors, producers, fellow actors all rushed over,tackling Natalie to the ground.

Nearby fans were ready to swarm her, fists clenched,ready to make her pay.

Jason raised his hand slightly to calm the crowd."Everyone chill-let the cops handle it."

"You're bleeding. You need to get that checked out."Megan's voice softened with concern.

Jason glanced at the wound, gave a relaxed smile."It's nothing.You okay?"

She nodded. "Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks." Though honestly,I probably could've handled it.

"Don't feel like dragging myself across town to the hospital right now. Got another scene coming up.Will you go with me to the school clinic?"

Since it was her fault he got hurt, Megan couldn't refuse. Still, seeing all that blood made her hesitate. The wound didn't look shallow.

She walked closer and gently rolled up his sleeve-her breath catching as she saw the gash. It was deep. At least ten stitches,easy.

"The school clinic might not cut it. If they don't do it right, you'll have a scar," Megan said, a hint of guilt creeping in. After all, scars were no joke for actors "Better head to an actual hospital."

Just then, Jason's agent, Julius Graham, walked over."Come on, Jason. I'll get you to the hospital."

Jason paused for a beat, noted Megan's expression,and finally nodded. "Alright."

After speaking, he walked a fewN steps, picked up the dropped designs and kraft. folder with his left hand,and handed them back to Megan.Just as they were about to get in the car, someone came running over in a hurry.
###Chapter 76 Please,Just Call Me Mrs...
The chilly breeze tugged at her curls as Amelia hurried over.

As she got closer, her face was full of worry, breath slightly uneven. "Jason, are you okay? I came as soon as I heard."

Jason sounded nonchalant. "I'm fine. It's just a scratch.You should get back to class."

A flash of disappointment flickered in her eyes but vanished quickly.

She glanced at Megan and offered a faint smile."Alright then, I'll leave him in your care."

In your care? Seriously?

He's not bedridden, and it's not like he's got one foot in the grave.

Isn't it weird that a married woman's the one 'taking care' of another man? The thought alone made Megan uncomfortable.


Megan gave a tight-lipped smile. "Talk another minute and your brother might bleed out right in front of us."

With that, she slid into Jason's van without looking back.


Jason burst out laughing. "Wow, just say you want me  gone. That mouth of yours is lethal."

Amelia stood looking at the shut car door, her expression unreadable.

The fresh exhaust from the car made her cough a little.

She never got why all her brothers seemed to like Megan. Samuel saved her once, Oliver was curious about her, and now Jason even got hurt for her.

Good thing she'd already had a private investigator look into Megan's background-she really was from the Shaw family.

Otherwise,she'd have been gone long ago.

Amelia watched the van blur into traffic, eyes still on it long after it was gone, her fists clenched tight.

"Got a minute?"

That sweet but smug voice made Amelia turn around,her brows knitting together."You?"

Capital Hospital, emergency room.

Jason sat casually in a chair, chatting with Megan."Honestly, I feel kinda defeated right now."

Megan raised a brow. "Because I didn't take that 600million-dollar necklace?"

"Nope. Because you're not even a fan of mine."

Julius almost choked on his water at that one.

Never had he heard Jason say something so blatantly cringe.  He wiped his mouth, muttering, "My bad, sorry."

Megan shrugged. "I don't really follow celebrities."

Julius looked skeptical. "A girl your age, and you're not into any stars? That's hard to believe."

Megan wiggled her ring finger with a smirk. "I'm married. Please, just call me Mrs. Reid."

Only then did Julius remember-right, she's Tristan's wife.



The guy had it all: power, money, charm, and he looked like he walked off a magazine cover. If he ever joined showbiz, no one else would even stand a chance.

Julius shot Jason a pitiful look-game over, buddy.She's vvery much taken.

Jason shot a glare his way, then turned to Megan,a smile tugging at the corners of his lips.

"That sketch-was it for the upcoming contest?"

"Yeah, gotta hand it in to my instructor later."

He nodded. "We might just get a chance to work together."

Julius looked like he'd stumbled on some juicy gossip."Miss Shaw's thinking of joining the entertainment industry?"

"Do you ever shut up?" Jason rolled his eyes. "I meant she's got what it takes to win the top spot at Verduria's annual fashion and jewelry design competition."  Julius wisely zipped it. Saying more might just land him in hot water.


Megan wasn't shocked about Jason thinking she could win-she had every intention of doing just that.

Jason was definitely something else.

First time they met, he tried to give her a necklace.

Second time, he helped her deal with Natalie.

It all felt weirdly familiar.

Ah-Samuel popped into her memory.

Last time a guy with yellow hair tried to mess with her,Samuel had jumped in like some fairy-tale dog chasing off evil spirits.

Now it was Jason's turn.


Apparently, being overly brave runs in the Lewis family.Speak of the devil, and there he was.

Through the buzzing ER entrance, a tall figure strode in quickly.

"No way, Jason, you actually got hurt?" Samuel glanced at the doctor. "Can you hurry it up?This guy's immune to anesthetics."

That one sentence caught Megan off guard. He's immune to anesthetics?


So he's been toughing it out this whole time?

How did he manage to stay so chill, like it wasn't even his arm being stitched up?

She felt a little shaken. "You okay, Mr. Lewis?" "Don't worry. Doesn't hurt."

Samuel shot him a look and muttered, "Yeah, right.You're the biggest wuss about pain at home. Now you're just showing off in front of a pretty girl."

The air around them dropped a few degrees. Jason's eyes grew icy.

The doctor, hands still slightly trembling, snipped the last stitch. "A-All done."

Jason rolled down his shirt sleeve, clearly annoyed."Don't you have something better to do? Found Black Wing yet?"

Samuel let out an awkward cough. "Anyway, come home for dinner tonight. Mom and Dad are back."

"Got it." Jason brushed past him, heading out.

Julius moved fast, stepping ahead to clear the way and shield Jason from enthusiastic fans who might bump into his arm.

SamueI looked at Megan. "Want me to drop you off at school?"

Before she could reply, Jason's voice came from the doorway. "Don't bother. I'll take her."

"No need, I'm here for my wife."

Jason turned to see Tristan standing right behind him -sharp suit, taller than average, and drop-dead handsome.

Even Jason had to admit, the guy had that striking look-deep eyes, strong jaw, and an effortlessly classy vibe.


Tristan nodded,smiling. "Thanks again for stepping in,Mr.Lewis. Didn't expect the Lewis brothers to save my wife twice."

He was polite up front, then casually tossed in"my girl" like a flag planted in the ground.

His gaze fell on Megan, lips curling into a smile,voice deep and smooth. "C'mon, Megan,let's go."

She grabbed her bag, hugging the kraft paper package close and skipped over.

Once close enough, Tristan wrapped an arm around her slim waist, his whole expression softening. "Are you alright?"

"I'm fine!" Megan beamed, glancing back over her shoulder. "But Jason had it rough with no anesthesia."

Tristan's eyes flickered with slight surprise before it vanished. "I've been hearing great things about your upcoming series 'Song of Rebirth.' I think I might throw in an investment."


The message was loud and clear-he was repaying the favor in his own way.

Jason gave him a small nod, slight smile. "Working with you would be a pleasure. I look forward to it."

Tristan pulled Megan in a little closer, smiling gently "I'll send some health supplements over to the Lewis house. Really appreciate everything that happened today." Then, with Megan in his arms, he left.

Watching them walk off, Julius commented, "Plenty of fish in the sea, man. We can keep looking."

Jason shot him a sideways glance and walked right past.

Okay.guess he's pissed now?

Did he say something wrong?

Samuel, knowing Julius wasn't an outsider and aware of the family's long search for the real daughter,stepped up and patted him on the shoulder. "Hey,don't you think Megan kinda. looks like my mom?"

Julius froze, then suddenly lit up. "Ah! So Jason's into women who look like his mom!"


Samuel took a long breath and gave him a top-to-bottom scan.


How exactly did this guy help Jason become such a big star?

Was it fate or something?

He fixed himn with a long, baffled look and walked off,speechless.

In a quiet corner of the café...Amelia stared out at the departing figure through the tall window, a sly,calculating grin slowly creeping onto her lips.

###Chapter 77 Taking Care of you is My...

Inside the dark, understated Bentley, Tristan leaned over and buckled Megan's seatbelt for her.

The angle of his face shifted just enough that their lips brushed accidentally-warm breath mingled,brushing against flushed cheeks.

His sharp, narrow eyes lifted slightly, and then,without hesitation, he caught her soft lips in a deep,lingering kiss.

His hand-broad, calloused-slipped smoothly under her silk shirt hem and traced along her waistline,drawing her further into his embrace.

What Megan didn't realize was that just as their lips met, Jason happened to walk past the car.

Moments ticked by, warm fingers wandered past her collar and brushed the soft skin of her neck.


The touch to her artery snapped her back to her senses.


She turned her head away, gasping for fresh air, her lips parting with a bit of resistance.

"You're spying on me again, aren't you?"

Tristan nuzzled into her neck, his voice deep, "I'm just worried about you." Megan raised a brow. "Really? The CEO of Reid Group has time to lurk around now?"


He chuckled lowly. "Taking care of you is officially my full-time job."


On the surface, his answer sounded serious, but think on it-it had way too many hidden meanings.

Megan's cheeks turned scarlet. She gave his chest a light push, "Shameless."

Tristan pinched her chin gently. "Just wait till our wedding night-you'll understand what 'shameless'really looks like."

He gave her lips a playful, teasing kiss. "Come on, I'll drive you back to campus."

"Mm-hmm."

The car slipped into traffic.

On the way, Megan stopped at a stationery store and bought a new kraft envelope, putting her drawings inside.


Twenty minutes later, they arrived at the first teaching building of Meridian University.

Several students nearby caught a glimpse of Tristan helping her out and holding the door for her.

He reached out, tousling her hair lightly. "I'll pick you up tonight for dinner at your mom's. I'll have Cameron drive your car back to the estate."

Then, he pressed a soft kiss to her smooth forehead before heading off.  Ignoring the stares-some jealous, some admiring-Megan headed straight into the building and walked toward the teachers' office.


No one was inside. She located the enrollment teacher's desk and placed the new envelope on top.

Just two seconds after she left, the indicator on the surveillance camera blinked off.

A minute later, the office door cracked open.

A graceful, curvy figure slipped in, swapped out all the drawings in the envelope, and left without a trace.

At noon, Megan and Rachel returned to Emerald Cove for lunch.


Penelope had personally cooked up a hearty spread.

As she dished food into their bowls, she chatted, "I saw the news-can't believe Natalie still hasn't learned her lesson. Went swinging a knife around today! Clearly,her little outburst at the party wasn't enough."

She paused, shaking her head. "Her mom's no better -completely irrational."

"But that actor Jason really stepped up today. Saved Megan right there on the spot."

Rachel bit into her chopsticks with a small pout."A shame,really. If my silly man hadn't dragged me off,I might've seen it all go down! Would've been way more exciting than the movies."

Penelope blinked. "Silly man?"

Rachel grinned brightly. "Kai, of course." Then quickly changed the subject, "But sis, kind of amazing, isn't it? Both of the Lewis brothers saved you Total fate."

Megan gave a small, dry smile. "Honestly, I could've handled it myself. Really."

"Ugh, so ungrateful!"

With a flick of her chopsticks, Megan gently tapped Rachel on the head. "That's called nosy mortals meddling in a goddess's business!"Penelope let out a soft chuckle, then her tone turned slightly stern."Megan, don't go knocking on Rachel's head again,alright?"

Rachel raised an eyebrow at Megan , clearly feeling a bit triumphant. Look who's got backup now.

But then Penelope's next words totally rained on her parade.

"Rachel's head isn't exactly the sharpest tool in the shed."


Megan burst out laughing. "Fair point! I wonder if Kai's IQ is dropping from hanging around her too much!"

Rachel pouted. "You always make fun of me, sis-in-law."


Penelope picked up a bite of food and chewed slowly,but seemed distracted rather than tasting anything. "I heard the Lees are planning to tie the knot with the Lewis family from Lindon."

Megan's smile vanished instantly. "When did you find out?"


Penelope laid her silver chopsticks gently on the table and replied casually, "Last night. Over dinner with some friends."

Megan glanced at Rachel, whose expression had clearly dimmed. "Hey, don't overthink it. No matter what happens, Kai's heart is with you."

Rachel let out a soft sigh through her nose. "I know someone like me doesn't exactly 'match' Kai's status...and Amelia is honestly kind of amazing."

Megan's heart ached a little. Rachel had lost her parents early and hadn't had it easy when it came to love.

She reached out and lightly patted Rachel's slender shoulder."Rachel."

But then Rachel suddenly smiled, though her eyes looked a bit misty. "Well, luckily Kai has a thing for girls like me who aren't so 'amazing,'right?"

Megan:"..."

She glanced at Penelope, and honestly? Maybe they didn't need to worry so much after all.

Later that afternoon, Tristan came to pick Megan up.

Seeing her frowning slightly, Tristan looked concerned."What's on your mind, Meg?"

She told him about the Lees possibly arranging a marriage with the Lewis family.

Tristan narrowed his eyes faintly. "So you're thinking  of pressuring the Lewises, make them back off like the Banks?"


Megan let out a sigh. "The Lewis family is like Reid's-one of the top corporate dynasties in the country.Making a move could stir up a lot of trouble.

Plus, Jason and Samuel-yeah, I know helping me might've been a bit much, but I still owe them.

And Grandpa's health. we're still counting on Brandon for that.


So no,we can't mess with them."


Tristan didn't say anything. He knew Megan wouldn't just let something slide unless she had another move coming up. So he waited.

And sure enough, she leaned in closer, her eyes gleaming with mischief. "That's why. I'm going after the Lees instead."

Just like he thought.

Tristan bit back a grin and easily accepted her plan to stir things up. "Want my help?"

Megan raised her brow with a confident smirk. "I've got this."

Tristan gently tilted her chin with his fingers, his eyes unreadable and his smile slow and knowing. "Don't be too sure. You might need me more than you think."

Megan rolled her eyes. "You're getting more full of yourself lately."

"Oh really? So what were you doing, kissing your own hand? Or were you about to-"

Megan quickly slapped her palm over his mouth before he could say something that'd make her blush to the roots.


But the sudden heat of his lips on her palm sent a shiver straight through her, like a jolt of electricity that hit too deep.

She quickly pulled her hand back, but Tristan caught it,holding it with calloused fingers that rubbed gently against her skin.

His smile could make someone forget how to breathe.His eyes looked like they held the stars.

His voice dropped low, rich and tempting. "Still want me to help?"

Megan's lashes fluttered as she swallowed. She couldn't help but say, "Yeah... I do."

Tristan tapped the tip of her nose with a smirk. "Knew it. You've been dying to get your hands on me."

Megan:"."
###Chapter 78 It Was The Best Decision E...
Reid Mansion.

Knowing Megan and Tristan were coming back, Elliot,Diane Hartwell, and Chloe had already been waiting at the door.


Hold on a sec.

Megan rubbed her eyes, "Wait, what the heck?"

Right next to Chloe was a familiar face flashing a big ol' grin.

Tristan chuckled, "Looks like this guy's dead set on becoming your brother-in-law."

As soon as they got out of the car, the little twin-tailed ball of energy launched herself at Megan with a bear hug.

"Missed you so much, sis!"

Megan poked her gently on the forehead. "What's this Goofball Bro doing here?"

Chloe beamed, "Goofball Bro's been awesome. He's my personal driver now-and he always takes me out for tasty food!"

Kevin brushed a hand through his bangs,"We're Team Thunder-Cutie." Megan gave him a cold sideways glance, then linked arms with Diane and Elliot as she walked into the house.


Chloe followed them in bouncing with joy.

Kevin scratched his head. "I get the feeling my future sister-in-law doesn't like me."


Tristan glanced at him and calmly adjusted his cufflinks. "Be more confident. Drop the 'feeling' part.""Huh?"


Tristan shot him a look. "You're not reliable."

Kevin touched his face in mock horror. "Is being good -looking a crime now?"

Without reacting, Tristan asked, "Found that mole in the company yet?"

Kevin coughed, "Uh. not... not yet."

Tristan gave him a dry half-smile and headed into the house.


Kevin muttered,"What kinda expression was that? Tch."

Dinner was all made by Diane, every dish perfectly tailored to Megan's taste.

Diane kept piling food onto Megan's plate. "Eat more,sweetie. Healthy babies need good nutrition."

Megan blushed instantly. "Mom, I'm still young. No rush."

Tristan cleared his throat, "Let's wait till Megan finishes college." Diane smiled kindly, "Just three more years, but by then, Tristan'll be twenty-nine."

Kevin's eyes lit up with mischief. "Guess if I become a dad, it'll be after thirty."

Chloe started counting on her fingers. "Why do you have to wait another four years, Goofball Bro?"

Kevin smiled sheepishly, "I gotta wait for my girl to finish college too!"

"Who's that?"


Kevin suddenly felt like someone stabbed him in the heart. wasn't it obvious? It's you!

After chasing her all this time, was his devotion just for show?


Megan eyed a dish of figs near her and slid it over to Kevin. "Long road ahead, my friend. Gotta stay strong -or end up forgotten and friendd-zoned."

That last bit really hit him right in the feels.

Chloe giggled, dimples popping. "Sis, I saw the news today. Can't believe Jason saved you! He's super dreamy!"

Kevin immediately leaned in, "What about me?"

Chloe gave him a side-eye, "You? You're definitely not as handsome as him."


Kevin:"..."


Diane, catching on to how hard Kevin was trying,gently chimed in, "Chloe, watch what you say/. Sure, Kevin's not a movie star, but he's not too shabby either."


Kevin: ".Ouch, Mrs. Hartwell, that still stings."

Elliot laughed, "Kevin looks fine, though he's abit old for my daughter."

Kevin: "...Wow. Mr. Shaw, that's even worse."

Megan, watching his totally defeated expression,couldn't help but feel kind of amused.

Still, she decided to throw him a bone and changed the subject. "Brandon's back from abroad next Monday.Tristan already contacted him-he'll check on Grandpa at the hospital."

Elliot gave a slight nod. "Brandon from the Lewis family is known for being a tough nut to crack. Not just anyone can get him to help. This time, it's all thanks to you, Tristan."

Tristan returned the nod. "No big deal."

Elliot turned to Megan . "Back then, you were still young and didn't see it, but now you get why your grandpa and I picked Tristan for you, right? It was the best decision ever."

Megan stuck out her tongue. "Yeah, yeah, I get it now.Thanks for seeing the good in him. Guess I was the only clueless one."

Chloe chimed in, "Well, even Dad had his blind spots -like with Molly. Took years for him to realize how fake she was." Elliot let out a heavy sigh. "You're right. That's on me.But there's still no news from Molly or Wyatt?"

Tristan's brows furrowed slightly, then he said, "Not yet. But I've already sent people to dig into it."

Diane Hartwell's expression turned serious. "Both of them are bad news. I just hope they're found soon before they cause more trouble for Megan again."

Tristan nodded softly. "Don't worry, Mom. I'll keep Megan safe,no matter what."

The moon hung bright in the sky, shadows of trees swaying gently.

Tristan drove Megan back to Dreamscape Manor.

As soon as they got out of the car,Megan insisted on checking out the sunken area near the lawn.

It was dead quiet, save for the sound of crickets.

Hand in hand, Tristan led Megan down the steps.With each step, LED strips lit up, glowing in different colors.

By the time they reached the last step and looked back, it felt like they were wrapped in a rainbow,standing in a dreamlike, colorful space.

Megan glanced around the underground room,a bit puzzled. She couldn't figure out what he meant this place for.

She wrapped her arms around Tristan's waist and looked up into his gleaming eyes. "Babe, what is this place even for?"

Tristan lowered his head and kissed her smooth forehead."You'll see soon enough."

Even though he was clearly keeping something from her, Megan just knew-whatever it was, it'd blow her away.

"It's kinda chilly here. Let's go back inside."

Before Megan could react, Tristan scooped her into his arms and carried her up the stairs toward the house.

Lying against his chest, Megan grinned like sunshine."You know where you're the warmest?"

"In my arms," Tristan replied without missing a beat.

Megan twined her arms around his neck, her soft lips brushing his rough stubble. Her fingertips slipped through a gap in his shirt and rested gently on his chest.


"Nope," she giggled. "It's your heart."

Tristan's steps froze, his body tense. His Adam's apple bobbed visibly.

Seeing that, Megan burst out laughing.

Tristan leaned down and pressed a kiss to her giggling lips, voice husky. "You cheeky thing... You've gotten way more daring."

Megan kicked her legs playfully, her delicate face the picture of innocence. "But I'm just a baby. What bad thoughts could I possibly have?"

Tristan narrowed his eyes, lips twisting into a faint smirk. "Then let's get back under the covers and see just how innocent this baby is." Upstairs, in a room on the second floor, Mr. Reid stood by the window holding his cane.

Watching the scene below,he stroked his white beard and muttered to Zeta Prime beside him, "You see that?My great-grandchild is on the way."

Zeta's mechanical eyes rolled, then rolled back again.

With Nova Tech resting on his head,the little Al puppy let out a squeaky voice, "It's night time, ya know. You should save that dream for the morning."

Mr. Reid paused, realizing this dumb dog just threw shade at him for daydreaming.

He thumped the floor with his dragon-headed cane,and Zeta took off running.

It muttered under its breath while fleeing, "Man,humans sure get cranky as they age!"

Elsewhere, at the docks, a woman in a black dress and mask stood still.

The salty ocean breeze blew across her face,whispering the promise of freedom.
###Chapter 79 Molly Appeared
Under the pitch-black night sky, the crashing waves mirrored the reflection of the moon,restlessly swirling

A passenger ferry docked at the pier cast out a blinding orange light. Most people would instinctively raise a hand to shield their eyes,but the woman in a black dress looked thrilled.


Just as she was about to step onto the ferry, two men in black suits suddenly closed in and restrained her.

She didn't even get a chance to struggle before being shoved into a van with blacked-out windows and fake plates.


The moment she got in, someone yanked off her mask and roughly jammed a black hood over her head.

After what felt like an hour and a half, the van pulled up at some mysterious house.

She was pushed into a room, stumbled, and fell hard to the ground.

Hearing the lock click behind her, she quickly pushed herself upright and tore off the hood. Seeing the same room she'd left just this morning, she lost it and screamed at the top of her lungs.

She thought she'd followed the masked man's instructions perfectly and evaded his eyes-thought she had a real shot at getting away.

Clearly, she thought wrong.

Now escape seemed next to impossible. She clenched her jaw, face full of anger and despair.

Outside the window, it was pitch dark. But in her mind still flashed the terrifying scene from earlier-it haunted her.

She got up, stumbled to the window, and yanked the curtains shut with force.


Turning back around, she dragged herself toward the bed.

Hot liquid suddenly started dripping from her nose.She wiped at it-it was blood.

A second later, the world started spinning. Her hand flew to her chest. The pain was awful,like steel needles stabbing straight into her heart.

She was terrified. What the hell was happening to her?

Barely keeping herself together, she crawled onto the bed.

Time dragged. It felt like forever before the ache finally started to fade.

Then her phone rang.

She fished it out from her dress pocket. The phone had been handed to her earlier that day by one of the masked man's bodyguards. Just for "convenient updates," he'd said. An unknown number popped up on the screen, way too long to be local. She hesitated and picked it up.

"Molly, got guts, don't you?"

That voice made her scalp prickle. It was him-the masked man.


He sounded casual, but every word dripped with threat and venom.


Her voice trembled, "S-Sir, I think there's been a misunderstanding..."

But he didn't let her finish. "Nosebleed? Feeling that stab in your chest?"

Her eyes flew open, panicked. So it was him. He did something to her.

Tears welled up, "Please. I don't wanna die. Just let me go..."

"Do what you're told. Or else..."

Molly felt like someone had their hand wrapped around her throat. One push, and she was doomed.

Hot tears mixed with bloody spit slid down her mouth and into her throat.

"I'll do it. Whatever you need me to do... I'll do it."

"This Saturday night, after the match ends,you-"





Eighty-eighth floor,Reid Group Tower-CEO's Office.

Tristan's sharp features looked unusually tense. He narrowed his eyes slightly, flipping through a few photos on his desk.

The woman in the photos wore a black dress, big shades, and a mask.

The pictures had been taken by the bodyguards he'd secretly dispatched to keep Megan safe.

After the acid attack by Nancy, mother of Natalie, the next day Tristan had ordered full covert protection for Megan.

His instructions were clear-never act rashly, don't expose yourselves. But if it came down to it, anyone who attacked was fair game. A kill shot was authorized,and he'd take full responsibility for all consequences.

Just yesterday, when Natalie came after Megan with a military-grade dagger, the guards had turned icy with tension, fingers tightening around their semi-autos in the bushes, ready to open fire.

Even though the scene was crowded and the riskof hitting innocents was high, their top priority was protecting Megan.

But to everyone's surprise, Megan's reaction was lightning quick. Even more unexpectedly, Jason had stepped in to help her out.The drama got defused pretty quickly.

After Megan accompanied Jason to the hospital, the bodyguard was just about to leave when something caught his eye-a woman in a black dress went to find Amelia. Something about the woman's figure made him do a double take-she looked a lot like the missing Molly He quickly snapped a few pictures.

When Molly noticed someone might be tailing her,the bodyguard didn't act rashly, just kept a safe distance so as not to tip her off.

Standing by the solid mahogany desk, Cameron lowered his head slightly. "Sir, their counter-tracking skills are top-notch. We completely lost them yesterday."

Tristan tapped his fingers on the desk rhythmically,each sound echoing in the tense silence.

After a long pause, he lifted his eyes, tinged with irritation. "Not surprising. Even if we had kept up,they wouldn't have let us walk away."

"Sir, should we tell the madam about this?"

His fingers stopped. "No need. Just tighten security around the Shaw family. Focus on the hospital."

"Yes, sir." Cameron bowed out and closed the door behind him.


Tristan walked to the massive floor-to-ceiling window,his long strides steady. Outside, the smoggy skyline of the capital city blurredthe outlines of towering buildings.


He stared into the distance,though his gaze showed no focus. Molly had resurfaced after both she and Wyatt were abducted. So-where's Wyatt?  Was Wyatt running his own scheme, trying to dodge the law? Or was there someone else pulling the strings?

And if there was someone else, who the hell could it be?


The mastermind lurking in the shadows was just like the thick smog-stifling, vague, full of mystery. But sooner or later, sunlight would pierce through and wipe out the darkness at its core.





Megan and Rachel stepped out of the car,heading toward the main academic building.

That's when a shuffle of footsteps buzzed behind them.


Megan turned around instinctively.

More than thirty girls were marching toward them,clearly not in a friendly mood. Each one carried a black plastic bag-and whatever was inside didn't look pleasant.

Rachel immediately got alert and nudged Megan's arm."Megan, I'm getting the feeling this squad's here for you."

"Feeling? No need for guesswork. They're definitely here for me."

Rachel swallowed hard. "Don't tell me... they're carrying acid?"

Megan's eyes turned icy as she ran her tongue across the inside of her cheek.

She yanked Rachel behind her for protection, though Rachel stubbornly moved back up beside her.

They shared a smirk, bracing themselves for whatever came next.


The group stopped about five meters away

Leading the pack was a girl with heavy smoky eye makeup and dreadlocks, rocking a full-on punk outfit.She strutted forward with her chin high. "Thanks to you,Jason got hurt!"

Megan and Rachel instantly got it-fans of Jason.

Rachel laughed sarcastically. "He was helping someone, acting out of decency. It's even on his official site. You guys are the ones being ridiculous now."


The puunk girl spat on the ground. "So what if you've got Tristan behind you? We're not scared of his name."

The rest of the group started shouting.

"She's already married and still throwing herself at Jason-classic homewrecker!"


"Looks likea vixen, probably using cheap tricks on every guy she meets!"

"We'll make sure she learns her lesson!"


...

Megan crossed her arms and raised an eyebrow. "Hey,you there-the wannabe Pirate of the Caribbean."
###Chapter 80 Jason's Fans Came to Sti...
Rachel couldn't hold it in and burst out laughing.

The girl with dreadlocks, often nicknamed "Pirate of the Caribbean," looked beyond insulted. Twisting her face up, she snapped, "Who're you calling that?"

Rachel shot back, "Obviously you! Who else answered if it wasn't you?"

"YOU-!"

Watching the dreadlock girl turn red and puff up with anger, Megan raised an eyebrow, a smirk playing on her lips. "If Jason had saved you yesterday, do you think you'd be the one getting all the hate today?"

For a second, everyone around just froze.

The girl gave a cold huff. "Doesn't matter. Our idol got hurt 'cause of you. Ever since you came back to school, everything's gone downhill. So many people punished, so many problems- all thanks to you. Just leave Meridian University!"

"Yeah,get lost!"

"Go away!"


...

Amid the chorus of insults, the dreadlock girl looked triumphant.  Then, in one slick move, she reached into a plastic bag and hurled something at Megan.

At the same moment, a small robot dog shot out from a side pocket of Megan's backpack.

Its eyes flashed blue beams, and whatever was flying at her shattered mid-air.

Burnt rotten egg stink filled the air. It was awful.

The dreadlocked girl's eyes went wide. "What the hell is that thing?!"

Nova Tech chirped in a babyish voice, "What the heck,I'm Nova!"


Rachel went, "So freaking cute!"

Megan gave a speechless stare. Where did the dog learn that kind of language?

The pirate girl backed off a step, then yelled to the crowd,"Attack!"


In a flash, more rotten eggs were flung toward Megan like storm clouds rolling in.

Out of nowhere, a tall figure stepped in front of her.

Another got shoved near Rachel.

Thuds echoed as eggs hit both of them.

Megan looked up, stunned, at the figure shielding her.The guy slowly turned, egg goo dripping down his face and hair,yellow yolk, broken shells- a total mess.

He wiped his face clean enough to reveal a shockingly attractive, pale face beneath alI that stink. His voice was calm and smooth, "You okay?"

Megan blinked. "Ja-Jason?"

She glanced at the buzzcut guy next to Rachel, also covered in egg goo, trying to figure out who he was "And.you are?"

The man barely dared breathe. "Just a Good Samaritan."

Megan squinted suspiciously at him.He took off.

Rachel yelled, "What's your name?"

"Good deeds don't need credit!" the dude shouted as he bolted down the campus path and disappeared.

Then another egg came flying from the fan crowd and smacked Jason right on the side of his head.

His eyes darkened.

Turning back to face the crowd, his voice held obvious anger. "I already said on Weibo yesterday, this had nothing to do with Megan. So why are you still harassing her?"

The dreadlock girl started crying, "Jason,why are you sticking up for her?! You like her or something?!"

Just then, Jason's agent, Julius, and a film crew including the director and actors rushed over.

Everyone started handing out wet wipes.

Director David Ford-one of the top directors in the country-took one look at Jason covered in egg mess and shouted at the fans, "This is how you guys act?You're not fans, you're just haters in disguise!"Jason  took a deep breath. "If any one of you had been attacked yesterday, I would've stepped in just the same. But if saving someone turns them into a new target the very next day, then what does that make me? An accomplice?"

The crowd started buzzing. Someone called out,"Then explain why you gave her that 600 million necklace at the charity auction,huh?"

"She's married, isn't she? Did she seduce you?"

"You're supposed to belong to us, Jason! You can't like anyone else!"

That was it. Megan shoved her bag into Rachel's arms and strode right past the stink-covered Jason,heading straight for the fans opposite them.

"So what you're mad about isn't him liking *me*,you're mad that he might like *anyone* who isn't you?"

"You call yourselves loyal fans, but what you're doing is pretty much stalking."

She stopped in front of the girl with braided hair,lifted a hand, and jabbed a finger against her face. Coldly,she pointed out, "Forehead and nose-filled. Eyes-surgically opened. Lips injected.Jaw shaved."

Then, with brutal emphasis, she poked hard at the girl's clearly enhanced chest. "And these? Totally fake."

"I'm not against plastic surgery, really. But you? A walking silicone doll trying to claim Jason as yours?Seriously?"  Megan's voice was sharp and crystal clear. "Where do you get the nerve?"

The girl's eyes went wide, not expecting to be called out like that. Furious, she shoved a hand into a plastic bag.

But Megan saw it coming. In an instant, she crushed the egg *through* the bag, squashing it against the girl's own hand.

"Ugh! My hand reeks!" the girl shrieked, horror in her eyes.

Megan didn't flinch. She grabbed the plastic bag and flipped it over right onto the girl's head.

Slimy, smelly egg gunk dripped down along with shards of shell.

The braided girl lunged at her, screaming.

Megan's gaze turned like ice. Without hesitation, she kicked the girl straight in the stomach.

When she retracted her foot, she calmly brushed nonexistent dust from her pants. "Now, take every last egg out of your bag and smash it on your own head. Or we're not done here."

The girl curled up on the ground, clutching her belly and wincing. "Everyone, get her-she can't take us all!"

Megan let out a short, amused snort. "Nova Tech."

Hovering midair, Nova answered, "Command received,pretty lady!"

"Give her a bald upgrade."  Nova zipped forward, tiny blades snapping out, circling the girl's head in a flash.

Locks of braid hit the ground like falling leaves. What was left looked like a shiny melon cap.

Megan arched an eyebrow. "Anyone else wanna try their luck?"


No one moved.


"Nova.Stand by."

That's when a crisp *splat* echoed from the crowd.

Everyone turned. Some of the fans had reluctantly started breaking eggs on their own heads-slow,miserable,but obedient.

They looked like a bunch of walking sunflowers.

Only then did Megan back off. With a slight wave, she said, "Let's not make this a habit, yeah?"

She walked up to Jason. "That's payback on your behalf, Mr. Superstar. Good enough?"

Jason:"..."


He gave a soft laugh, his eyes flicking toward her shoulder.


He brushed something off gently, discreetly closing his hand around it.

And watching silently from the crowd, a pair of eyes caught that moment-

They clenched into fists. and walked away.
###Chapter 81 DNA Test No Match
Megan had no clue about Jason's little move-she just thought he was brushing some dust off her shoulder.


But when that fishy smell hit her nose, she wrinkled her brow in disgust.


Seeing that, Jason felt she was being ungrateful. He reeked because he took the hit for her!


He cleared his throat, "You don't need to be *too*thankful or anything."


Before he could finish, Megan let out a snort,"Wouldn't be caught in today's mess if it wvasn't for *you*, thank you very much."


Jason looked at her in disbelief. Was that even human speech?


"If you hadn't played hero yesterday, pissing off that swarm of stalker fan, none of this would've happened! Just like Sam the Sham"


Jason muttered, "Sam the Sham?"


"Jason! You okay?" Samuel rushed over, out of breath.




Jason chuckled, "You're the 'Sam the Sham' she was talking about?"


Samuel narrowed his long, fox-like eyes at Megan,"Did you say that?"


Jason pat his shoulder, "Alright, let's go hit the showers."


Samuel recoiled. "Geez, Jason, you stink! Let's keep a bit of distance,yeah?"


As the Lewis brothers disappeared into the distance,Megan called out, "Thanks, Mr. Movie Star Jason!"


Jason didn't look back, just waved a hand.


Next to her, Rachel was staring dreamily at his tall,straight back. "Even smelling like garbage, he still looks like a king."


She turned her head. "Hey, Megan, you think Jason might actually be into you? Dude gifted you that 600million necklace, took a hit for you, and even shielded you from flying eggs."


Megan flicked her forehead, "Girl, what are you even dreaming about? When has Jason *ever* looked at me with anything close to affection?"


Rachel scratched her head. "Then why is he so nice to you?"


Megan narrowed her eyes slightly. "He once said I reminded him of his mom. Maybe that's why."


"But both brothers treat you really well!" Rachel suddenly recalled another guy who stepped up earlier. "Say, people these days are surprisingly brave,huh?"


"Totally," Megan agreed. But her mind replayed how that other guy had clearly tried to shield her,only for Jason to shove him aside and take the front. She couldn't help but smirk.


"What's funny?" Rachel asked, confused.


Megan gently rubbed the top of her head, "Nothing.Just thinking you were lucky today." If Jason hadn't popped up, you'd have been the one in trouble.


"C'mon, let's get to class."







Capital Hospital.


Samuel held up a long strand of hair between his fingers. "Man, you really pulled it off, huh?"


Jason gave him a sideways glance. "Hurry up and get this to the lab and match it to yours. Get Mr. Hall to do it personally-this has to be quick."


Samuel nodded and bolted straight to the testing department.


Mr. Hall, being close with Brandon and known for his caution and detail, had always been someone the Lewis family trusted. Normally, Brandon handled DNA checks himself, but whenever he was out of the country, Mr. Hall was the go-to.


After calling him, Samuel handed over the hair with emphasis on how important this test was.


Mr.Hall promised he'd oversee everything and they'd get a result within two hours.


With that, Samuel left the hospital.


As soon as he opened the car door, he instantly brought his hand up to cover his nose. "Didn't feel it earlier when we were together, but after walking back and catching a whiff again... Bro, you stink!"


Jason shot him a sharp look. "Did Mr. Hall look uneasy when he talked to you just now?"


"Yeah, totally. I told him this test mattered a lot."


Jason let out a cold chuckle. "Well, that's 'cause you smelled amazing."


With a loud thud, he slammed the door shut and the car sped off.


Samuel caught a whiff of the rotten egg stench on himself and finally understood why Mr. Hall looked like he'd swallowed a lemon. Smelled amazing? More like a biohazard.


When people walking past him started giving him odd looks, he just wanted to crawl under a rock.


He flagged down a cab, ready to head back to Meridian University. Since they'd used Jason's car earlier, he'd left his own parked at school. Time to grab his car, hit the villa for a shower, and loop back for the report.


Two hours later, feeling fresh and clean, Samuel arrived at the Capital Hospital right on time. He was buzzing with anticipation.


But the moment he saw the test report Mr. Hall handed over, the smile vanished from his face. The result? No genetic relation between the two samples.


A weird emptiness started spreading through his chest. He frowned hard, pulling out his phone.


"How is it?" asked Jason on the other end. Just two words, but Samuel could hear the tension in his voice.


He chuckled quietly."It's a no."


Silence. Then the call dropped.


He sent a text to Oliver:[No match.]


Breathing in deeply, he realized the air around him didn't feel as crisp as when he first came in.


Meanwhile, in a corridor by the emergency stairs,someone in scrubs slowly slid down the wall.Clutched tightly in her hand-a single long strand of hair.


She didn't even want to imagine what could've happened if that hair had gone in for testing.


Taking a deep breath, she quickly stood up, stripped off the nurse uniform, and left the hospital in a hrry.


She needed to head back to Lindon City and get some hair from the Lewis family.


It was a two-hour drive from the capital to Lindon City.


By the time Amelia reached the Lewis family estate in Lindon City, it was nearly 3 p.m.


Walking through the gate like she owned the place,her face calm as ever.


Housekeeper Mrs. Clark greeted her with a small bow. "Welcome home, Miss Amelia."


Amelia gave her a graceful smile. "Mrs. Clark, has anyone else come home today?"


"No, ma'am. None of the young masters have returned."


Amelia nodded politely. "I left a piece for tomorrow's competition here. Thought I'd come grab it."


"Would you like me to help you look for it?"


She smiled gently. "No need, thank you. I'll manage.Go ahead with your work." As Mrs. Clark walked away, the smile on Amelia's face faded. Inside, she was on edge-but her movements stayed elegant and unhurried as she stepped ontothe zigzagging staircase.


On the third floor, she quietly doubled back to the second.


Her almond-shaped eyes scanned the surroundings cautiously before she darted into Oliver's bedroom.


Among all the brothers, Oliver stayed in Lindon City the most. Jason was often filming out of town, and Samuel rarely left the imperial capital.


She quickly moved to the bed, lifted the velvet blanket, checking under it and the pillows for any stray strands of hair.


Suddenly, she spotted one by the pillow.


Picking it up with her fingers, she let a small smirk play across her lips.


And just then. the door handle turned. The door pushed open.
###Chapter 82 LiMo Is A Man
The spacious room was dead silent as Amelia stared at the strand of hair between her fingers, a sly smnile curling on her lips.


Then-click. The door opened.


She whipped around, the smile frozen mid-air.


"O-Oliver."



Oliver stepped in. His sharp jawline and straight nose gave off a composed elegance, but under that calm exterior, there was always a trace of sharpness that made people wary. He casually hung his suit jacket on the coat rack, his eyes cool and examining.


"What are you doing in here?"



Amelia took a breath, trying to steady herself before forcing a calm face. "The competition's tomorrow. I just remembered I left a decoration piece at home.I thought you'd be around, so l popped in to say hi."


Oliver's expression darkened instantly. "Mrs. Clark told me you stopped by-and asked if we were at home together. You clearly knew I wasn't here. Why sneak into my room?"


He took a step forward. Amelia could feel a chill climb up her spine, sweat starting to bead at her back.



"What's in your hand?" he asked coldly.


She casually let the hair slip through her fingers and fall to the floor like it meant nothing. With a seemingly innocent smile, she brought both her hands to the front and opened her palms to show to him,letting him check.


Oliver's gaze stayed skeptical. "Leave. And don't ever come into my room again."


Her face dropped, as if genuinely hurt. "Got it.Oliver." As she walked past him with her head down, his voice turned colder: "Don't play games behind the Lewis family's back. What's not yours will never be."


She quickly left the room.


Oliver looked around. The bed-it had clearly been disturbed. He went over to where she was standing earlier. Nothing there. Maybe he was just overthinking it.


With that thought, he walked out and headed to the study for a video meeting-completely unaware of the lone hair strand still lying quietly on the gray carpet.


Back in her room, Amelia leaned against the door and then slowly slid to the floor, hands slightly trembling.


No rush. There'll be another chance to get a clean sample tested.


After packing a few accessories, she left the Lewis estate.


At Dreamscape Manor, Tristan was in a video meeting when his phone buzzed. He picked up the call.



"Talk."



Cameron's voice came through, "Boss, Samuel went to Capital Hospital. Had Director Kyan Hall run a hair sample test. Amelia also showed up later dressed as a nurse, went into the lab but didn't stay long."


Tristan rubbed his chin. "What were the results?"


Cameron answered, "The two samples came back with no blood relation."



"Did we confirm whose samples they tested?"


"No sir, but it's pretty clear Amelia swapped hers in."


Tristan's tone stayed relaxed, "The Lewis family's been trying to find their real daughter for years.Hundreds of attempts, all dead ends. Wouldn't be shocked if the real one slipped through ages ago.That imposter clearly hasn't been sitting idle."


Cameron asked, "What about the sample switch?"


Tristan twirled the pen in his hand. "Leave it for now. Let's see what happens tomorrow night."







Next morning.


Megan lazily rolled over and snuggled close into the man's chest.



Tristan pressed a kiss to the crown of her head."Babe, didn't you say someone's coming over today?"



Her eyes snapped open and she suddenly sat upright. "What time is it?!"


He glanced at the watch on the nightstand. "Nine twenty."



She leaped out of bed, dashed to the bathroom to wash up, and reappeared minutes later in a crisp shirt,jeans, and peach-red flats, bounding out of the walk-in closet.



Meanwhile, Tristan stood at the door in a clean white casual outfit. "You going too?" he asked.Tristan pulled Megan into his arms, his warm hand sliding under her shirt, lazily caressing her smooth waist.


He smirked, "You went to the airport yourself to get a friend, of course l've gotta meet them."


Megan's heart skipped a beat. If Mia slipped up and said the wrong thing, that'd be bad.


As she zoned out, the hand on her waist gave a firmer squeeze. "Don't tell me... it's a guy?"


Megan gave a little snort. "So what if it is?"


Tristan leaned in, nibbling at her ear with a grin."Then I guess I'll just have to teach you a lesson."


"You sure you've got what it takes to tame me tonight?" Megan shot back, fingers working to undo one of her shell buttons.


Then another. And another.



Tristan's eyes darkened. He quickly buttoned them back up and cleared his throat. "Uh... we're gonna be late picking up your friend."


Megan arched a brow at him. "Wow, Tristan. Acting like a noble gentleman now? Meanwhile, I look like a total flirt."



Tristan chuckled, driving her to the Capital City Airport himself.



But Megan didn't let him tag along inside-he was too tall, too good-looking. Way too noticeable. She slipped on the newest LX sunglasses, grabbed her bag, and got out of the car.



Those shades covered half her face-celeb must-have.





Soon,a curvy woman with loose waves came walking out, pulling a suitcase behind.


Once she spotted Megan, she rushed over and hugged her tight.


"My queen! I've been losing sleep these past six months without you!" Megan patted her back. "Drama queen. You got all the stuff?"



Mia gave her chest a confident tap. "Relax, I came fully loaded. We're gonna kill it tonight. But seriously,you need to catch up on the autumn-winter line.While you vanished, I was here trying to copy your designs just to hold the line!"


Megan walked alongside her. "I got married. To Tristan."



Mia's jaw dropped. "Didn't you say he was a nutjob?"


"He's actually wonderfuI," Megan said seriously. "He doesn't know I'm Lila Moore though, so don't blow it."



Mia looked shocked. "Why not tell him?"


Megan smiled softly. "I want to stand beside him,not behind."



Mia looked at her like a fangirl. "Classic queen move.Never a man's shadow." As they stepped out of the airport, Mia spotted a guy in a face mask and cap leaning coolly against the car,hands in pockets.


"Oh. My. God. That's just... unfair levels of handsome." Mia pretended to wipe drool. "You were outta your mind not marrying him sooner."


Megan sighed, "Trust me, I know. I was blind as a bat."



The man spotted Megan and smiled beneath his mask,walking over.


"This is Mia, dedicated tailor for designer LiMo,"Megan said,making introductions.


Mia gave a polite nod. "Nice to meet you, Mr.Reid."


Tristan blinked, then chuckled. "So that's why Megan hasn't been buried in sketches lately-she had someone to handle it for her."



Mia glanced at Megan and laughed awkwardly."She does the drawings-I just help when I can." Tristan tugged Megan into his arms. "Looks like my girl and LiMo are super close, huh?"


Megan's scalp tingled all of a sudden. Did he figure it out?


Then he turned to Mia and asked casually, "So...LiMo's a guy,or...?"


No one's ever actually seen Lila Moore, so there's always been speculation.


Okay-that was definitely jealousy.


Megan breathed easy.


Mia's eyes sparkled with mischief. "Oh, definitely a man."
###Chapter 83 So, Mr.LiMo Is a Guy, Huh
Mia's words had just left her mouth when Megan's smile completely froze.


She had clearly told Tristan the other day-LiMo was a woman.



She suddenly felt the grip on her waist tighten. That hand,warm and firm, sent a subtle warning.


Tristan's sharp eyes flickered briefly, then went still.His skin, usually pale and clear, now looked as cold as frost, distant and intense.


He leaned close to Megan's ear and murmured, "So,turns out Mr. LiMo is a 'he', huh?"


Her lashes fluttered as she cast a sidelong glance at Mia. "Babe, don't listen to her nonsense. She's just messing with you." But Mia, fully committed now, chuckled, "He said you've got real potential. He's betting you'll win tonight!"


Megan:[Mia,you're dead meat.]


Tristan's thumb slowly slid along her waistline, his voice low enough for only her to hear, "We'll settle this properly tonight, sweetheart."


He then let go of her, grabbed Mia's luggage,and loaded it into the trunk, driving them both to the hotel he'd arranged.


On the way, Mia kept ridiculously quiet. She knew she'd overdone it and was terrified Megan would fire her if she pushed any further.


Since models were coming soon for fittings, Tristan just dropped them at their room and left.


Mia grinned sheepishly, "LiMo, I think I really messed it up."



Megan gave her a cold side-eye. "Wow, you actually realized that?"  Just then, Nova Tech poked its head out of Megan's bag. "You little troublemaker! You stressed out Boss and Goddess! I'm gonna tattoo your lips!"



Mia, seeing the palm-sized Nova, didn't sense any danger-only thought it was adorable. "Aww, it's so cute! And it even trashes people!"



Megan raised a brow. "Um, did you not catch the part where it said it would tattoo your lips?"



"This thing can actually do that?"


Seeing Mia still clueless, Megan decided to clarify,"Last time it did that, the guy literally looked like a clown afterwards."



Mia's smile dropped. She gulped, finally catching on that this mechanical pup was not just a toy.


"You... you're not serious, are you?"


Megan leaned back on the black leather sofa,crossed her arms and legs like she was front row at a good show. "Nova's fully autonomous and has a high threat level.Most importantly? It never jokes around."


She grabbed an orange from the fruit tray and placed it on the coffee table. "Nova, give the orange a nice lip tattoo."


"Yes, Goddess!" Nova chirped sweetly, jumped over to the orange, and extended a needle glistening with red liquid from its mouth.


A hiss sounded-and bam, a clown smile appeared right on the orange.


Mia went pale. She crouched beside Megan's legs."Lila,I was wrong,okay?!"


Megan lifted her chin with a finger. "Mia, thanks to your little 'joke,' I'll be paying for it tonight."


"Hey, isn't that what sleep is for-solving problems?"


Megan's expression darkened immediately.


Nova added cheerfully, "They don't sleep, they play the spanking game!" Megan looked like she was about to explode. This mutt was absolutely selling her out.


Mia, meanwhile, was gawking. She plopped down next to Megan. "Wait a sec-you two got a marriage license already, and still nothing real happened?Don't tell me... he's not up to it? Seriously? That guy's got the looks and bod, pretty sure he could break a bed."



Megan slapped her hand off and shot her a glare."He's just being respectful. He's waiting for the wedding night."Mia Ford's lips twitched as she gave Megan a once-over. "With curves like yours and that innocent little face, what guy wouldn't fall for you?Unless.something's wrong with him?"



"Mia, you picking how you wanna go out?Horizontally or vertically?"


Mia darted a nervous glance at Nova Tech, instantly covering her mouth.


Nova Tech looked ready to pounce, just waiting on Megan's signal. With muffled panic, Mia mumbled behind her hand,"Lila Moore, I messed up."


Nova Tech retracted its needle and plopped down on the coffee table, tilting its head. "Hey hey, pretty girl,you're still using the name Lila Moore?"


It started auto-scanning then blurted out, "Lila Moore-founder and head designer of the luxury brand LX. Gender unknown. Estimated net worth:two billion USD."



Crap!



Totally forgot the dumb dog was there!


This robot never knew when to keep quiet.


Megan cut in quickly, "Nova Tech, remind me again what happens to a disloyal bot?"


Nova Tech froze mid-sentence, its four legs starting to shake. "D-d-dismantled. please don't dismantle me! Nova Tech can keep secrets!"



Megan leaned forward and lightly tapped its head "Good."



Right then, someone knocked on the suite door.


After confirming who it was, Mia opened it to reveal three blonde, blue-eyed models.


She greeted them with a hug-Zoe Leopold, Rebecca Ford,and Jane Hines-top international models who exclusively worked with Lila Moore.



Since they didn't know Megan was Lila Moore, they walked in all high and mighty, completely ignoring her sitting onthe couch.



Mia glanced at Megan, who just gave a subtle shake of her head.



Zoe smoothed her golden hair and said with a smirk,"If it weren't because of Lila Moore, no way would have ditched Fashion Week for some small-time event like this."



Rebecca and Jane nodded in agreement.



Megan didn't get offended. She stood up and greeted them in flawless French. "Thanks for making the trip. Tonight's competition dresses are for you."


The three were taken aback by the confident tone from someone so petite. They clearly weren't expecting much from a no-name designer.


Knowing they were tough to impress, Megan gave Mia a look. Mia opened the suitcase and laid six dresses and some necklaces out on the bed.



The models were stunned into silence.



Zoe walked over and picked up a soft lilac gauze gown. "This is stunning. Other than Lila Moore, I can't think of anyone else who could design something this ethereal."


Rebecca grabbed two dresses. "Feels like her style for sure!"


Jane squinted at Megan, scanning her from head to toe."Wait,you didn't copy Lila Moore, did you?"


Megan shrugged. "Mia's Lila Moore's personal seamstress. You think she'd let plagiarism slide?" Instantly, the three models circled around Megan,showering her with compliments, saying her designs were on par with Lila Moore's, predicting she'd make it to the top of the industry soon.



Once they changed into the gowns, they were surprised to find each one fit perfectly-no tailoring needed.



A bit later, Cameron arrived with a stack of takeaway boxes from Zen Grove Table-all of Megan's favorite dishes.



Jane suddenly blurted out, "Wait, you're the one married to Tristan?"



Megan gave a polite nod. "That's me."


Zoe snapped her fingers. "So that's it! Lila Moore must've given you the designs as a favor to Tristan!"


Rebecca acted like some mystery had just been cracked. "Oh, I get it now-Tristan probably bought the whole design portfolio for a fortune. And even hired Lila Moore's personal seamstress for you!" 
Megan:"."



Mia:"."
###Chapter 84 The Mask Is Off

Mia scratched his head. "You guys got it all wrong.That's not how it happened."


The three models didn't even bother to hide their suspicion-there was blatant doubt in their eyes.


Copying or buying out a design? That was basically the cardinal sin in the design world.


And clearly, in their minds, Megan had already been judged guilty of one of the two, no questions asked.


Right then, Nova Tech suddenly bounced forward."Ma déesse, c'est Lila Moore. Taisez-vous, les trolls moches.!"



The perfect French rolling out of a robot dog's mouth-yeah,that kinda froze the girls.


Jane pointed a shaky finger at Nova Tech. "Did it... just call us ugly trolls?"


Meanwhile, Rebecca and Zoe looked like they'd just been struck by lightning. "Wait. You're Lila Moore?"


Megan's whole forehead twitched as she shot Nova Tech a death glare.Traitor trash bot!



The three models were now buzzing nonstop like a bunch of overexcited fans-turns out the designer they had worshipped from afar was just a teenager.



The rest of Megan's afternoon pretty much went down the drain-they were way too hyped and wouldn't stop orbiting around her.


She had to stress about a thousand times: under no circumstance were they allowed to expose her identity.


Even though they didn't really get her reasoning, all three swore to keep their mouths shut.



The competition venue was at the Capital Expo Center, scheduled to start at 7 p.m. At exactly 6 p.m., there was a knock on the hotel room door.


The moment Jane, Rebecca, Zoe, and Mlia saw the man standing at the door in a dark navy suit, they just... froze. Not even blinking.


The guy, though? Didn't spare them a glance. His eyes were laser-focused on Megan and Megan only.


Fair skin, high nose, those sharp phoenix eyes-Tristan didn't just look good. He radiated quiet power and class without even trying.


World's youngest billionaire, devastatingly attractive-honestly, no girl out there wouldn't fall hard.


Cameron shook his head. The way Tristan carried himself-it was like walking, breathing royalty. Dude was unreal.


But somehow, this walking god was totally wipped for a pint-sized drama queen.


Sure, Megan was gorgeous. But the world's full of pretty faces. What deadly magic did she cast on this  man to win himn over?



"Cameron, take them to the car.My wife needs to get ready."


Cameron gave a nod."Understood."


He gestured politely. "Ladies, if you'll follow me."


Room door clicked shut. Tristan curved his lips into a faint smile and walked straight toward the girl he hadn't seen since this afternoon.



He scooped her up without warning, stole a kiss from those strawberry lips, and murmured, "Missed you."


Megan's porcelain-like cheeks flushed instantly.Her hands pressed weakly against his chest. "Hey, come on. Time to get ready. I have to do some quick makeup."


Tristan chuckled, didn't tease further, and let her head to the vanity.


As Megan reached for a sexy red lipstick, Tristan suddenly snatched it away. "I'll do it. Close your eyes."


"Going with the Tristan Style?" Megan raised a brow.


"You don't like it?"



Instead of answering, Megan tilted her head up and closed her eyes like a queen granting permission.



Keeping his gaze on her delicate face, Tristan dipped his pinkie into the lipstick, then gently applied it over her perfectly-shaped lips.



Megan was a little surprised. Wasn't he usually the one to wear it himself, then kiss it onto her?



But not this time.



Noticing her confused look, Tristan smirked slightly finger tracing her now-bright lips. Then he tilted her chin and kissed her again.



When he finally pulled away, he glanced at her now-faded tint and smiled. "This shade-that blend-it suits you better."Megan knew exactly what was going through his mind-that color was just too tempting. What a scheming big dog he was.


Tristan handed her a beautifully wrapped box. "Take a look. See if you like it."


She opened it, and the moment her eyes caught sight of the dress, her gaze darkened. It was the starry night gown she'd designed six months ago.


The dress was mostly black, with shimmering threads stitched to look like drifting galaxies, dusted faintly with pearl shimmer. Under low light, it gave off a soft, ghostly glow.


Like a radiant stream winding through the night sky-absolutely breathtaking.



There was only one in the whole world, and she never guessed Tristan would be the one who bought it back then.



"This dress is stunning, but it's a design from half a year ago. If you're not feeling it, I'll have Cameron bring you another one."


At the time, Megan loved the dress too much to part with it. But then a mysterious buyer threw out a ridiculously high bid, and eventually, she let it go.


She never imagined it would come back to her hands like this.



She poked his solid chest playfully. "Tell me, who were you planning to give it to when you bought it six months ago?"


Tristan leaned in, the bridge of his nose brushing lightly against hers. His tone was low, teasing."You've lived in my heart for years-who else could it have been for?"



She held back a laugh, lips curling up. Tossing the gown onto the bed, she wrapped her arms around his neck. "Babe, be real with me-was I the lead in your very first *ahem* dream?"



That question totally caught Tristan off guard.


He blinked, then played it cool. "Never had that kind of dream."



Megan rose on tiptoes, a mischievous smile dancing on her face as she kissed him softly. "Seriously? Not even once?"



A faint flush crept onto Tristan's pale cheeks, his Adam's apple bobbing hard. "Megan, it's time."


Suddenly she hopped up, catching him off-guard-he instinctively caught her by the hips.


Her fingertip traced his sharp jawline, then paused at the bump of his throat, where she gave the skin a teasing bite. "So, really not even once? HMM?"


That tiny "hmm" hit him like a spark to dry tinder,igniting something deep in his chest.


"Don't move," he muttered, voice low and strained.


She laughed, light and wicked. "Oh, I'm moving-maybe next time don't lie to me."


"You still wanna make that competition on time?"


She locked her legs tighter around him. "Tell me first."



A vein pulsed on Tristan's temple from holding himself back.



He swallowed hard. "Fine. Yes. It was you."


Satisfied,Megan hopped down and let go.


With zero hesitation, she started unbuttoning her shirt and peeled off her jeans.


The lace over her curves left little to the imagination.


She stepped close, arms slipping around his waist."Tristan, do I look hot?"


His voice rasped against her ear, "Megan, you're playing with fire."


She pouted. "But I faiI every time."


In a heartbeat, he yanked her in hard, his lips finding the curve of her neck. His kisses were slow, hot,sending shockwaves of sensation through every nerve.


Then he caught her lips in a kiss she could barely breathe through. "You're a real little minx, you know that?" He toppled them onto the bed, calloused hands trailing down her leg in deliberate strokes.


"This time...you win."


And just like that, his burning kiss crushed against hers, sending her heart into overdrive.


He shrugged off his jacket, leaned down, and devoured her lips like a man starved.
###Chapter 85 Was It Love at First Sight
The vibration of her phone snapped Megan back to reality. She nudged the man above her. "Babe, the competition's starting soon."



Tristan's voice was husky and low. "Let's skip it."


Megan pressed her fingertip against the lips that were about to drop a kiss. "Everyone's waiting. If we don't go down now, they'll start thinking something's up."


"We're married. What's there to guess?"


Megan blinked her clear eyes at him. "Guess you're a quick finisher."


Like a cold bucket of water, that hit Tristan straight in the face. He lowered his head to lightly bite her annoying little mouth. "You should get a license before speaking with this mouth." He rolled over and stretched out beside her, throwing an arm over his eyes to calm his racing thoughts.After a few deep breaths, he sat up.


Megan had already changed into the starlight gown she designed. She tilted her head, smiling at him.


The warm glow of the setting sun in Diandu shone through the curtain slit, casting a soft orange light across the room. The dress gave off a faint shimmer,like stars sprinkled in the dusk-breathtaking.


The only thing reflected in Tristan's eyes was her, like she held the galaxy. He couldn't help but say, "You're stunning."


Megan tapped a finger playfully on his brow. "So.was it love at first sight?"


Tristan thought about it. Probably more like love at first kiss, though 'kiss' wasn't exactly the right term.


He chuckled. "Something like that."


Megan clicked her tongue teasingly. "Love at first sight is just lust with good PR. You're not an exception!"


Tristan: "..." This mouth, seriously.


He pulled out a pair of black velvet heels from the bag and knelt to help her slide them on.


Her delicate ankle was almost too pretty to look at.


He stood back up, offering his arm. "Shall we, Mrs.Reid-the most gorgeous woman on the planet?"


Megan linked her arm with his and the two walked out of the room together.


By the time they got downstairs, Mr. Brown was already waiting beside the car, holding the door open.



Megan gracefully got in, followed by Tristan.


Mr. Brown gently shut the door before getting into the driver's seat and pulling off. Once inside,he raised the privacy partition.


Fingers intertwined, Tristan looked over at Megan."Nervous?" Megan blinked slowly. "Define nervous-is it edible?"



Tristan gave her a look, trying not to laugh. "LiMo gives you this much confidence?"



Megan laughed, already expecting him to bring that up. This jealous guy probably wanted to sue her alias for stealing attention.



She leaned on his muscular arm like a cozy kitten."Isn't your strength what keeps me going most of the time?"



"My strength,huh?"


Her mischievous hand snuck under his shirt, fingers tracing the firm lines of his abs. "That core power from your waist..."


Tristan's heart raced like crazy. His gaze darkened,heavy with want. "Keep this up, and I'Il end up eating you alive."



Megan knew when to stop, but she adored seeing him lose composure. She pulled her hand back and wrapped both arms around his. "Later tonight, okay?"


Tristan took a deep breath, trying to steady the storm inside. "You're such a tease, you little minx."


Meanwhile,Cameron was driving a second car, which carried four very chatty women.


Jane was practically swooning. "Tristan is just...wow."



Rebecca and Zoe rolled their eyes. "Please. Wipe your drool. That kinda man isn't in your league."


Up in the passenger seat, Mia asked Cameron, "You catch any of that?"


Cameron looked genuinely confused. "Nope. Not a word."



Mia shot him a thumbs-up. "Exactly why I appreciate reliable background characters like you."


She turned back to look at Jane. "Only that man is worthy of our goddess-Lila Moore!"Cameron froze for a second behind the wheel, a sharp breath caught in his throat-he might've just uncovered a seriously wild secret.



Being at Tristan's side for so long, naturally he'd picked up a bit of foreign language skills. Sure, his pronunciation still needed work, but he could understand most of it.



So, Megan -the drama queen herself-was actually the big-name designer, Lila Moore?!



Right now, driving was the last thing on his mind. He just wanted to chew on his fingers out of shock. This was insane!



Noticing his stunned face, Mia asked, "Hey, you okay over there?"



Cameron quickly snapped back, "Yeah, yeah, al good."



"What's your name?" she asked, brow raised.



"Cameron!" "Nice name." Mia gave a sly smile then turned to the other three. "His name's 'Ice Cam'!"



Cameron:"..



The car finally pulled up to the Imperial Capital Exhibition Center.



Even though this wasn't an international event, it was still a major national competition, pulling in its fair share of celebrities and media figures.


A red carpet stretched from the entrance all the way to the front doors. Fans and reporters from major media outlets across Verduria lined both sides behind crimson barricade lines.



The black metallic Maybach came to a smooth stop at the entrance, and the second Tristan stepped out,the crowd erupted. Even the organizers made their way over to greet him.


Tristan held Megan's hand as she stepped out of the car, guiding her onto the red carpet. Meanwhile, the driver pulled away. Their entrance turned heads immediately. Under the blinding flashes of cameras, the starlight dress Megan wore sparkled brilliantly, stealing every bit of attention.



Right behind them, Mia and three international models followed closely, making the scene even more eye-catching.


After all, Mia was the face of the Lila Moore brand-every major LX launch had her name on it. Add three global supermodels to the mix, and they obviously drew a flood of camera flashes.



"Isn't that dress Mrs. Reid's wearing a Lila Moore original?" someone from the crowd whispered.


"I heard that starlight gown is meant to be a love letter to someone special."


"Mr.Reid really knows how to spoil her!"


Tristan's hand on Megan's waist squeezed just a bit tighter. He leaned down and whispered low, "Did that designer ever tell you what the dress actually means?"



Megan caught the jealous tone immediately. This man was becoming a world-class vinegar jar. She wrapped her arms around his neck, stood on tiptoe,and gave him a quick kiss on his thin lips. "All I know is, it's from the person I love most."


That shut him right up-and pleased the hell out of him too.



He smiled like a cat that got the cream. He was sure that kiss would be seen by Lila Moore himself.


Megan sighed in her heart. Seriously? What a grown-up baby.


Meanwhile, in front of a swarm of mnics and pressing cameras:



"Ms. Ford, are you looking to collaborate with whomever wins tonight?"


"Will LX be signing the winner as a designer?"


"Are these models here to support any particular contestant?"



They bombarded her with questions.


Mia lifted her hand calmly to cut them off. "We're just here to show support, nothing more."


"So... who's lucky enough to get this kind of support?"


Mia smiled gently. "Megan. It's our pleasure to work with her."



"Would Lila Moore be helping Mrs. Reid with the design work?"



Mia could hear the shade behind that question loud and clear-were they implying the design wasn't Megan's and had just been bought or ghost-designed?



And they didn't even acknowledge Megan as a contestant, just 'Mrs. Reid'-like everything she had was thanks to Tristan.


 
Keeping her cool, Mia answered clearly, "Megan  graduated top of her class in Fashion and Jewelry Design from Meridian University. She was also an exceptional exchange student at Boris University. We believe in her talent."



"Then will LX be recruiting her as a designer in the future?"



Mia laughed to herself. LX was her company. She was Lila Moore. Who was she even gonna hire,herself?



She gave a light nod. "Any outstanding designer-LX will never hesitate to bring them on board."


With that, Mia led the three models into the exhibition center.


At the same time, two tall figures walked toward them from the opposite direction.
###Chapter 86 Amelia Tampered with The Test Results
Two men in sharp suits stepped onto the crimson carpet-one in charcoal grey, the other in deep sapphire blue.


Samuel shot a sideways glance at Jason and said,"Bro, did you really have to go all formal tonight? I look totally outclassed next to you."


Jason's eyes had a calm clarity, with a gentle hue beneath the cool surface. His well-defined features carried a trace of quiet melancholy, like a piece of art displayed behind glass-beautiful, untouchable.


He gave a faint smile. "Even if I threw on a potato sack,I'd still outshine you."


Samuel looked speechless. "Wow, ruthless. I used to be the school's poster boy, y'know?"


Jason let out a soft, amused snort. "And I'm a  national heartthrob."


Samuel curled his lips. "Well, Tristan is an international heartthrob."



The mention of that name wiped the smile off Jason's face. "Seriously? That's just throwing shade at your own family. ldiot."


Samuel:"..."



Reporters lined up along both sides, eagerly raising their mics.


"Mr. Lewis, who are you rooting for to win tonight?"


"Jason, are you here to support Megan -Mrs. Reid?"


"Since Miss Lewis is a contestant too, are you cheering for your sister tonight?"


Before either of them could answer, a petite figure hurried over. Trailing behind her was a chubby girl carrying a case, along with three top domestic models.



"Jason,Samuel!" Amelia wore a pure white off-shoulder lace gown.Her collarbones peeked through subtly, and her elegance gave off a snow-lotus-on-ice vibe.


With her sweet voice and tiny footsteps, she quickly slipped between her brothers and playfully hooked her arms around theirs.



Though the two men clearly looked annoyed,they didn't shake her off-probably for the sake of appearances.


"Oh, so you're here to support your little sister's big moment!"



"Word has it that the winner might get to co-star with Mr.Lewis in his new project!"


"If Miss Lewis wins tonight, we could see a sibling duo on screen-how exciting!"


"Jason, any thoughts seeing Mr. and Mrs. Reid together tonight?"


"Samuel, we heard you once stepped in during a campus attack involving Mrs. Reid-are all the Lewis  brothers that protective of her?"







Amelia had planned to ride her brother's fame into the spotlight. But the media just kept circling back to Megan,never giving her the center stage.


She should be the highlight tonight, the showstopper, the queen of the night. She wasn't going to let anyone steal her thunder.


With a calm sparkle in her eyes and a composed smile, she said, "My brothers are kind-hearted.They've already clarified their actions that day-for them, it didn't matter who needed help, they'd step in regardless.


I just hope our friends in the media don't twist their actions or chase clout at the cost of my brothers'peace of mind.


As for who wins tonight, well, maythe best woman win."



"Sounds like you're feeling pretty confident, Miss  Lewis."



Amelia beamed. "With my brothers here to support me, how could I not give it my all? Let's all wait and see."



Arm in arm with Jason and Samuel, she strutted down the red carpet, graceful and poised.


They walked in silence.



Once inside the venue, she tactfully let go of their arms, clearly sensing they weren't keen on maintaining the act any longer.


Putting her hands together in front of her, she gave a bright smile. "Jason, Samuel, I'll head to my dressing room now to get ready."


The chubby girl sneaked a peek at Jason, her cheeks turning crimson, before scurrying after Amelia.The three models glanced back at the Lewis brothers with a hint of reluctance before following Amelia.



Watching Amelia's retreating figure, Samuel asked,"Jason, who do you think will win tonight?"  Jason gave it some thought, then looked at him,"Who do you want to win? I'll go with that."


Samuel rubbed his chin. "Then I hope Amelia takes the crown."



Jason raised an eyebrow, a faint smirk tugging at his lips. "You and that royal blue suit of yours do make a good match with her getup tonight. Please, stay a bit further from me-we're clearly not on the same wavelength."


With that, he turned and headed toward the exhibition hall.


The convention center held a massive runway with the judges' panel up front. Rows of seats flanked both sides, neatly lined.


The front seats on either side were for VIP guests.The further back, the cheaper the ticket-just supply and demand.



Even so, tonight's competition, while not on the scale of an international event, was still a major show in Verduria. Scalpers were pushing regular seats to 200k, and tickets were practically impossible to get.


Jason and Samuel stepped into the hall, scanning for their spots.


Following the seat numbers, they soon noticed a tall,commanding figure had already taken his seat.


Tristan looked up with a pleasant expression. "Mr.Lewis, Samuel. Small world,huh?"


Jason and Samuel gave a polite nod before sitting down.



Jason glanced sideways at Tristan, seated right beside him. "I just want to make one thing clear-l've got zero intentions toward your wife. Don't let the rumors mess with your head."



Samuel chimed in, "Yeah, we just. felt kind of a connection with her. That's all."


There was a hint of amusement in Tristan's eyes."Don't worry. Even if there were, you wouldn't stand a chance."  Just then, Cameron approached.


Tristan reached out, catching an envelope which he handed to Jason. "A little something to thank you for saving my wife."


Jason opened it. Inside was a stack of photos.


He pulled one out, his brows instantly furrowed. "You were trailing her?"


Tristan leaned back, totally unfazed. "I only track two kinds of people-my wife, and anyone looking to hurt her."



Jason's mind immediately jumped-Tristan must've found out they tested Megan's hair.


Samuel grabbed the photos and skimmed through them quickly.


The woman in the pictures was unmistakably Amelia.The date matched the day Mlegan was hit with eggs,and the location was the Capital Hospital. In one photo,Amelia was wearing a nurse uniform, holding something as she exited the lab. In another, she was  leaning against a wall, looking almost terrified.


Tristan let out a soft chuckle. "The Lewis family's tested all kinds of people before. Might be time for another run-you never know, maybe your beloved heiress is still in the mix."


Jason felt sure of one thing now: Tristan didn't know they'd tested Megan.



If he didn't know, then there was no reason to give it away.


Jason looked puzzled. "So you followed her. are you saying she tried to hurt Mrs.-your wife?"


Noticing his change in phrasing, Tristan's face eased slightly. "Whether she did or not, let's keep watching and see."



Jason and Samuel exchanged a glance.


Samuel took out his phone and shot off a text:[Amelia tampered with the test results.]


Not long after, a message came back from Oliver: [So that's why she came to my room that day-she was after my hair.]


Holding the phone tightly, Samuel fumed in silence.


Then he leaned toward Jason's ear and whispered,"Later tonight, maybe you should try pulling another hair from Megan."


Jason shot him a side-eye like he was looking at a total idiot. "You've got a death wish for both of us or just me?"
###Chapter 87 Weren't You Stanning Amelia
Backstage lounge.


Each contestant had their own private room-just enough space for changing, doing makeup, and catching their breath before hitting the runway.


Megan had crafted six dresses in total. When she submitted her entry, she picked her top three for the official lineup-the ones she had the most confidence in. She saved these stunners for the finals.


That meant for the semi-finals, Zoe, Jane, and Rebecca were each dressed in the remaining three.


Megan chose outfits based on each model's skin tone.



Rebecca had that sun-kissed, slightly tanned skin, so Megan went with a deep blue gown that shimmered like candlelight. It had a plunging V-neck that hugged the figure just right and a sleek cut that revealed her bare back-not too much, but just enough to make heads turn. Sexy but still classy.


That's the brilliance of Lila Moore's design flair-it pulls you in while still keeping you at arm's length.


Jane, on the other hand, had porcelain-like fair skin,which meant she could basically rock anything.Megan picked a soft lilac knee-length dress that fit her like a glove, accentuating every delicate curve.


The bodice was detailed with emerald and sapphire stones, and from the waist fell layers of gossamer fabric-so light and sheer they looked like mist. Gold and silver threads laced through the skirt, forming intricate patterns that looked practically magical.


In that dress, Jane didn't just look good-she looked otherworldly, like a fairy that lost her way to a forest runway.


As for Zoe, her skin was on the darker side, so Megan passed her a black gothic lace gown.Zoe slipped into it fast-the layered lace danced with  every movement, drawing an elegant and mysterious silhouette.



Megan curled Zoe's already wavy black hair and added a bold red lip. Just like that, Zoe looked like a vampire queen-cool, poised, dangerous in the best way.



Zoe couldn't believe Lila Moore herself helped with her makeup. She was beaming, totally hyped.



Jane and Rebecca weren't about to be left out after that and instantly started begging Megan for their own glow-up.


Meanwhile, at the expo hall, it was standing room only.


Everyone in the hall was somebody-or at least thought they were. Especially those VIP seats,where three men were clearly the center of every debutante's fantasy.


But their whole vibe screamed "do not approach."Cold auras like that? Anyone with a sense of self-  preservation steered clear.


The lights dimmed. The entire space fell into silence.


A spotlight hit the back of the stage, and a tall figure stepped into it.


He was suited up, looking polished, and his smile had just the right amount of charm. He walked to the front of the runway like it belonged to him.


That man? John Fairall, the country's top host. His voice, deep and rich, signaled the start of the competition.



"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Imperial Capital Fashion Expo. I'm just your humble little host," he joked, earning a wave of chuckles and applause. "Tonight, we're in for a visual feast.Fashion that speaks. Style that stuns. And if one of these designers catches your eye, remember to cast your vote. That one vote might just launch someone into greatness."



"Let me break down the rules real quick," he  continued. "After a nationwide selection, fifteen designers made it to the semi-finals. From here,the judges will pick the top five to move on to the finals.And then, for the final round, it's all in the hands of both our panel and you lovely people seated here.Together, you'll choose who walks out of here as champion, runner-up, and third place. The champion? They'll be named the top designer of the year and even get a collab with none other than our megastar,Jason."


(A collective gasp echoed across the hall.)


"And now, let me introduce tonight's judging panel-three heavyweights in the fashion industry: Jeffery Grant, Elena Glancy, and Sean Greene!"


(The room burst into thunderous applause.)


"Alright, enough talk. Let's witness fashion history together. The show starts now!"A retro, mellow tune played, and from the backstage, models in dazzling dresses strutted down the runway with graceful steps. Megan watched the runway show on the lounge's LCD screen, a slight smirk pulling at the corner of her lips.


Tonight was hers to win.


Sure, she originally signed up for the competition because Natalie provoked her, and now that Natalie was in legal trouble waiting for sentencing, Megan still wasn't about to back out.


After all, loads of people didn't believe in her,claiming she was only where she was thanks to Tristan.


Well, tonight, she'd let her skills do the talking-blind them with brilliance.


Mia rubbed her chin, confident. "Lila Moore, there's no way tonight's ending in suspense."


And it didn't. In the semi-finals, where judges had to score each look without knowing the designer's identity, Megan's three dresses pretty much swept the floor-29.7 out of a possible 30. Amelia came in second with a total of 27 points,which honestly wasn't even close.


Tristan narrowed his eyes, obviously impressed. He hadn't expected his girl to be this talented.


But of course, the buzzing whispers soon kicked in like annoying mosquitoes:


"Don't you think Megan's designs look a lot like Lila Moore's work?"


"You heard? Lila's personal tailor and her go-to models are here tonight. Probably means Megan just bought the whole collection from her."


"I mean, with a husband that loaded, dropping billions is probably just a warm-up."


"Ugh, I'm so jealous I could cry."


"Real talent's what should be respected. If it's bought-or worse, copied-what's even the point?"


"Exactly. I like Amelia's stuff too. I'll vote for her later." "If this round's up to audience votes, Megan's not gonna make it."


"Who knows? Maybe the judges've been paid off too."




...


People weren't curious or admiring-they were just bitter and spiteful.


Tristan didn't even look back. He knew Megan would shut those rumors down hard.


Samuel nudged Jason with an elbow and whispered,"Bro, guess you're working with Megan soon. Didn't see that coming, huh? She's actually super legit."


Jason gave a small nod, then looked over at him side-eyed. "Weren't you stanning Amelia?"


Samuel pulled a face. "Nah, I was just trolling. My loyalty's with the little boss lady."


Completely unaware that she'd earned a new fan,Megan was in the dressing room, helping models  change.


She picked out the perfect dresses to match each model's vibe, did their makeup, and styled their hair with care.


Nearby, Mia helped out and stuck numeric tags-1, 2,and 3-on the models' arms.



Since Megan placed first in semis, she got to use the top three numbers. Amelia's group used 4, 5, and 6.The rest followed.


Soon after, a staff member knocked, signaling the models to line up and get ready.


Megan flopped down on the couch next to Mia, both watching the live stream.


"Lila Moore, these three are from your original drafts,right?"


Megan nodded. "Don't they pop even more than the last set?"


 
Mia nodded so fast her head might've fallen off. "Totally! Absolute stunners. There's just something about your designs-been trying all year to copy your style, but I just can't capture that spark."


Megan let out a teasing chuckle. "You know what that's called?"



"Trying-too-hard chic?" Mia joked, just as Megan's playful smile gradually faded.


Following her line of sight, Mia looked at the screen-and froze.



She raised her hand, pointing. "Wait...is that-"
###Chapter 88 | Am LiMo
Megan narrowed her dewy eyes, locking onto the big screen.


And there it was-the dresses on her model and Amelia' were basically twins. Cut, fabric, even the sheen-it was a one-to-one match.



The crowd broke into whispers and murmurs instantly.


Just then, a staff member knocked on the door,asking Megan to head out and address the situation.


Mia,hot-tempered as ever, was about to storm up there first, but Megan stopped her with a calm hand.


"You wait down here," she said softly.



Megan stepped onto the runway at an unhurried pace, the hem of her starlight gown swaying gently with a pearly shimmer under the lights. Even the skeptics watching from below had to admit it-this woman was stunning, flawless like a polished jewel.



She came to a halt beside three featured models.



Just two meters away, Amelia stood next to her own model, expression unreadable.


The three judges-Jeffery Grant, Elena Glancy, and Sean Greene-shared uncertain glances. The whole hall had gone silent.


Suddenly, the mic let out a sharp screech that made some wince.



Sean Greene leaned in and tested it, "We'll hear from both participants for an explanation."


Host John moved to Amelia, who lifted her hand requesting to speak first.


She looked perfectly calm and innocent. "I have no idea what's going on. But those three dresses-yeah,they're from my original designs." John then handed the mic to Megan. "Ms. Shaw, your response?"



Megan looked straight at the judges. "Those dresses are from my sketches. I've got nothing to hide. Let's just show both our drafts and clear this up."


The judges huddled for a moment before signaling to the team to bring Megan and Amelia's drafts up on the screen.



Big screens lit up on both sides of the stage.


On the left: Megan's sketches. On the right: Amelia's.


"Wait a sec, Megan's drawings don't match the dresses at all."



"That kind of seals it-Megan copied Amelia."



"The designs, the material-way too similar to be a coincidence. No way that's not plagiarism."



"This is beyond embarrassing, the whole country's watching. Let's see how her little fan club defends her now." "She even wanted to collaborate with that superstar?What a joke. No doubt the Lewis family's done with her too."


"She wants it all, huh? Tsk."



·..


Megan let out a short, cold laugh and waved John over with a tiny motion.


He stepped forward quickly, and she snatched the mic from his hands.



She pointed to a well-dressed, flashy woman in the audience who'd just accused her.


"You said if I didn't plagiarize, you'd rip your own head off,right?"


The woman stood up dramatically, chin raised high."Your sketch doesn't match the clothes. Obviously,it's plagiarism! Disgraceful!"


Megan chuckled without warmth. "Well, I'll be waiting to see that pig head." Then she turned to Amelia, eyes sharp. "You're really sure those sketches are yours? I'mn giving you one last chance."



Amelia looked like she might cry. "Megan. I know those dresses are stunning and you admire them, but you should respect other people's hard work."



Megan cut her off coldly. "I already gave you a way out. You're the one who blew it."



Amelia's heart pounded like a drum. Could Megan actually have proof?



No way. The pencils, the paper-it's all pretty standard stuff. Easily faked.Not to mention, all the cameras in the hallway and the office mysteriously stopped working that day.


Plus, she wasn't the one who switched the sketches.


So as long as she stuck to her claim, no one would find a loophole.



She stood firm, "This is my design!" Megan turned tothe three judges. "What happens to someone who's confirmed to have plagiarized today?"


Jeffery replied, voice stern, "Anyone caught plagiarizing today won't be allowed to work as a designer in Verduria again."


Megan's eyes were sharp, her smile faint. "Whoever copied today has no place in this industry again."


Elena raised an eyebrow at Megan's words.Something felt off. She let out a curious chuckle,"Alright. If we prove someone copied, they're out of the design world."


Megan looked at the host, John. "Bring me the sketches."



John blinked. "You mean Amelia's?"



Megan nearly smacked him with the mic. Her voice went cold."Mine."



John gulped, then took the sketch papers from a staff member and handed them to Megan. She tossed him the mic. He caught it instinctively.


"These seem pretty ordinary, right? But. there's a trick to them," Megan said as she gently rubbed one corner. "They can actually split in two."


As she spoke, she peeled the paper into two separate sheets-every single sketch did the same.


Amelia clenched her fists, her lashes trembling. "I didn't think you'd figure that part out."



Megan let out a soft laugh. "That dress you're wearing today? Definitely suits you."


"What?" Amelia frowned, clearly confused.


Megan raised an eyebrow, a smirk playing on her lips."Such a lovely little angel. with poison under her halo."



"You-how could you humiliate me like this!" Amelia's pale cheeks flushed deep red, looking a picture of righteous indignation.


Sean shrugged. "Well, that doesn't really prove anything yet."


Megan handed the torn sketches to her go-to models-each got two sheets.


"Turn them around. Let the blank sides face the judges!"


The three models held up the paper so the supposedly blank sides faced forward.


Everyone was puzzled. It was just plain white paper-nothing special.


A woman decked out in pearls and diamonds sneered, "Trying too hard. Just admit you copied already."


Right after her words, gasps echoed through the crowd.



"Wait-look! There's writing!"


From the six sheets held by Zoe, Rebecca, and Jane,letters slowly revealed themselves- "IAMLIMO."

"I am Lila Moore!" "What the heck-isn't that the famous international designer?"


The audience buzzed with shock.



Amelia hadn't seen this coming.


Jeffery leaned forward, curious. "Care to explain what all this means?"


Megan just shrugged. "Just a little insurance against people stealing my work."


"This paper looks totally normal, but it's actually layered with a film. Once the paper's split, and the film's exposed to air,it vanishes fast."


"And I treated it with phenol, which oxidizes in air and turns into a brownish color-what you're seeing now."


Then she turned to Amelia. "Did you know about this?"



Amelia bit down hard, red nails pressing into her palm, not even feeling the pain.


If she said no, that'd make her a liar. She took a long breath. "Of course I knew."


Megan laughed, almost giddy. "Then tell me-where did you get your paper?"
###Chapter 89 Jason Had Seen Those Sketches

The packed auditorium was dead silent.


Dust particles swirled under the stage lights like they had a life of their own.



Every eye was fixed on Amelia, waiting for her to speak.



A cold sweat clung to her back, and her face was the picture of innocence and grievance.


She hadn't expected that Megan , that spiteful woman, would actually bring someone from Lila Moore here.



Lila Moore had always kept a low profile-nobody even knew if they were a man or woman,or how old they were.


And tonight, both Lila Moore's exclusive tailor and the designated model were present.



If she claimed to know Lila Moore, what if they started asking her specific stuff? How the hell was she gonna talk her way out of that?



After hesitating for a while, she forced a stiff smile."That sketchpaper? It was given to me by Molly a while ago."



A cold chuckle slipped from Megan's lips. She had to admit-this woman was slippery, even dragging in a missing person as a human shield.



An older woman in pearls snorted. "So what else can you say now? You totally stole it!"



From the corner of the room, Rachel abruptly stood up. "These sketches are definitely Megan's! Do you have no shame,Amelia?"



Next to him, Kai reached up and rubbed his temple.


They'd purposely sat low-key in a back corner,hoping to steer clear of the press.  The last thing they needed was reporters swarming around Kai with questions about the Lee and Lewis families.



Especially now, with talks of a potential Lewis-Lee alliance.Wherever he went, reporters latched on like leeches.



Well, now Rachel had totally blown their cover.


Amelia's lashes trembled. "Rachel, I know you're bitter about the alliance between our families, and I get that. But that doesn't give you the right to twist the facts."



Rachel looked like he was about to storm the stage and tear off her act right then and there-but Kai caught him just in time.


At that moment, the huge LED screen flickered to life,rolling a clip.


Amelia sat across from a woman in sunglasses and a black dress, chatting animatedly at a café.


Then it cut to Megan walking into a professor's office with a manila envelope. She set it down and left.


Cut again-to the tall, graceful lady in the black dress sneaking in, switching the sketches inside the envelope, and slipping back out.


Next shot: the same woman in a quiet alley,handing that envelope over to Amelia.


Someone in the crowd gasped and shouted a familiar name-Molly.


Megan glanced at Tristan in the audience. He met her gaze with a faint smirk.


Got it. So this was his doing-that footage had come from one of his people.


But what surprised her was that he hadn't told her Molly had reappeared.


Did that mean he'd already found Molly and Wyatt?


And whoever took them-was that mystery about to unravel too?

 
Still, one thing at a time. First, she needed to shut down this plagiarism drama.


Tilting her head, she smiled at Amelia. "So what Molly gave you wasn't just 'paper,' huh? You mean the whole damn sketch, right?"


Amelia's face was streaked with tears, the picture of pitiful.


She choked on her sobs, but whatever she tried to say now just came off weak.


Her hands gripped the fabric of her dress so tight that she'd wrinkled it. "These sketches are really mine. I don't know how they faked that video."


In other words, she was claiming the footage was doctored.



Some people just wouldn't admit the truth till it kicked them in the face.



Megan's gaze swept over the models wearing Amelia's designs.


Then she turned back to the judges. "Could you  three please come up? I believe experienced eyes know the difference between real beauty and a bad knockoff."


The three judges exchanged looks, then stepped up to the runway to examine the gowns-comparing what Amelia's models wore with the ones presented by Megan's team.lt didn't take long for the verdict.Elena stood center stage, mic in hand, and announced, "Megan's dress is finely crafted with neat stitching. In contrast, Amelia's design may look similar at first glance, but it's clearly rushed-sloppy work overall."



Amelia shot a look toward Mia Ford in the crowd and retorted, "Everyone knows Mia is the exclusive seamstress for Lila Moore. Her craftsmanship is unmatched."


She was clearly throwing shade, hinting that Megan hadn't made the dress herself-implying someone else did it for her.


And she wasn't totally wrong. Megan handled the design, but Mia took care of the actual production. Megan turned slightly, eyes on Amelia. "There's a sketch of a pendant in the paper bag too. Did you make that pendant?"



Amelia forced herself to nod, signaling the chubby girl beside her to bring up a small gift box. Inside was a pale green spherical pendant.



When Amelia first saw the sketch, she thought it looked average, nothing special.


But once she realized it was made from diamond-grade glass meteorite, alarms went off. This stuff forms when certain meteorites melt during their descent and then cool into glass.


It's often mistaken for obsidian and is also called Leigong Ink. While the black variety is common,pale green ones are super rare-and worth a lot.


She didn't have time to search for real material, so she had someone use jade instead.



Megan looked over at Mia."The pendant."


Mia walked up the stage and opened a black velvet  box in her hands. A light green, crystal-clear pendant lay inside, glinting beautifully.


Megan picked it up, holding it between her fingers as she explained, "This is a gem-grade glass meteorite from outer space. It's flawless, high-purity, no cracks, densely packed with microbubbles. The piece is stunning-partially transparent like glass,sparkling under the light. It's top-tier for both meteorite collectors and gemstone lovers. The value's beyond estimation."



The three judges were clearly stunned. They knew how rare and valuable these meteorites were,especially in such pristine condition. All of them leaned in, eager for a closer look.


Megan then glanced at Amelia, her tone casual yet sharp. "You ever heard of the phrase 'trying too hard to copy and still failing'?"


The chubby girl suddenly jumped forward, accusing Megan, "You say the sketches are yours-who's to say they're not actually Lila Moore's? Maybe you just bought them off her! She gave you her seamstress  and model after all. Bet you just threw money around to get your way!"


Mia's chest heaved in anger-she'd had enough.


She pointed straight at the girl, voice firm. "That's slander, plain and simple!"


The chubby girl ran over to Jason, pleading, "Jason,help out Amelia, would you? She's clearly being picked on!"


Jason frowned, his tone ice-cold. "Is she being picked on, or doing the bullying herself? She knows the truth better than anyone. The day I got hurt,I happened to see Megan's original sketches. They were amazing-burned right into my memory. And somehow, they ended up as Amelia's work?"


The moment he finished, not just the chubby girl-all of them in the room froze.



Was this a public betrayal?


Amelia was completely blindsided. Jason had seen those sketches? And why would he expose her like this in front of everyone?


She may not have been a true Lewis by blood, but she'd called him "brother" for years. Why? How come everyone stood by Megan's side? What did she do wrong?


Still unwilling to back down, the chubby girl huffed,"Doesn't mean Megan drew them either. Money talks, right? Lila Moore could've been paid off for all we know!"



Just then, a high-pitched mechanical voice rang out.A tiny robot dog with wings started circling above the crowd.
 ###Chapter 90 Honest Nova Tech
Everyone stared up, completely dumbfounded. What the heck was that?



Nova Tech, with her soft but smug little voice,announced proudly, "Listen up, you clueless humans,my Goddess is Lila Moore herself!"


After dropping that bomb, she landed gracefully on Megan's shoulder.


But then she sensed something icy in the air, and immediately shoved her robot dog head into the crook of Megan's neck, trembling like crazy.


Suddenly, everything made sense. The "Goddess"the machine dog mentioned-it was Megan.


The hall went dead silent. No one could believe that the founder of their beloved fashion brand was this girl who looked barely twenty. Rachel looked totally lost. She turned to Kai, blurting,"Kai, am I hearing things? Did that dumb dog say Megan is Lila Moore?"


Kai reached out and pinched her cheek. "Yes."


Rachel's eyes widened. "I'm really hallucinating then!"


Samuel was in full-on disbelief. "Bro, that girl is actually Lila Moore?!"


Jason reached over and closed his brother's gaping mouth. "I heard it too. You're acting like someone who's never seen anything in life. Even a robot looks down on you."


Jason darted a glance at Tristan. He noticed a quick flicker of surprise in the man's eyes before it disappeared.


He chuckled. "So, I take it this is news to you too,Tristan?"


Tristan let out a light laugh. "Please, I've known all along." Cameron, standing nearby, didn't even dare to breathe too loudly. He had a feeling that Tristan just found out like the rest of them.



If Tristan figured out he had known before him...Cameron might really end up sent to work in the mines in Africa.



Megan faced Amelia. "Copying my design? Seriously,are you trying to bury yourself?"


Amelia's eyes filled with tears, giving off that pitiful vibe. "Th-That's impossible! No one's ever seen Lila Moore.You're lying!"


Mia put her hands on her hips. "Excuse me, I'm not no one, okay? Dumbass! Bet you didn't expect to run into a steel wall today,huh?"


Megan gave a faint smile. "Out of respect for your family, I won't press charges. But from now on, the design world is off-limits to you. Permanently."


Amelia bit down hard on her lower lip, her heart pounding like it was about to burst out of her throat. She couldn't accept this outcome-no way.


Just then, the double doors swung open, and in strode Ryan with three officers tailing him.


He stood just below the runway and said, "Ms.Amelia, someone reported that you've had close contact with fugitive Molly. We need you to come with us and assist in our investigation."


Amelia looked over at Jason and Samuel, hoping-what,for help?


The two of them stood up and headed toward the exit without so much as a glance back.


That flicker of hope inside her instantly crumbled into nothing.Who was she even counting on?


It was Jason who had just exposed her lie. Why would he care what happened to her now?



She dropped her gaze, eyes burning with a fierce and growing hatred.She took a deep breath and followed Ryan out of the hall. Megan cast one last glance at his disappearing figure, then turned her sharp gaze to the flashy older woman who'd accused her of plagiarism earlier."Didn't you say you'd rip your own head off if I didn't plagiarize? Well, I'm right here, waiting for your little show-go ahead and pull that pig head off."


The woman trembled with rage, her voice shaky."You're going too far!" Then, tail between her legs,she made a quick escape.


Tristan flicked his wrist, and Cameron stepped forward instantly.


"Dig into her background," Tristan ordered.



"On it!"



The competition went on-though everyone already knew the outcome, the formalities still had to be wrapped up.


The judges came up to award Megan the championship trophy, then crowded around her,snapping photos together. Many socialites began swarming around Megan,hoping to cozy up to her. After all, they were hardcore fans of the LX brand. Getting on this designer queen's good side meant opening every door in the fashion wold.



John slipped through the crowd with a hopeful grin."Lila Moore, mind if I grab a quick photo with you?"


As soon as the words left his mouth, the temperature seemed to drop ten degrees. A sudden coldness wrapped around him like a tight jacket.


He stiffly turned his head to look up-and froze at the sight of the tall figure before him.


Flashing a mouthful of overly white veneers, he chuckled awkwardly. "Mr. Reid!"


And just like that, he vanished.


Tristan's lips curled into a teasing smirk, mischief flickering in his eyes. "So my wife turned out to be Lila Moore,huh?"

 
Megan held his big hand in both of hers, softly  tracing his palm with her fingertp. "Hehe, surprise!Bet you didn't see that coming. Lila Moore's no mister,y'know."


With a chuckle, Tristan wrapped his arm around her waist, tucking her close. "Not a mister, but definitely one clever little lady. That starlight gown? Cost me five million bucks. And now you're wearing it again.Total con job-nicely played."


Megan's eyes sparkled with laughter. "Honestly, I thought that mystery buyer was just a rich kid with too much money. Never expected the real buyer to be you."


Leaning down, his voice low and warm against her ear, he whispered, "Remind you that you will pay for your lies tonight?"


Megan's cheeks turned rosy and she swatted at his chest. "I don't know what you're talking about!"


"Well, then I guess we'll just have to test that out tonight," Tristan murmured. "I'm done playing nice." Megan bit her lip, grinning like she already had a few guesses about tonight's plans.


Right then, Rachel came bouncing over and hugged Megan's arm. "Sis! You're seriously Lila Moore? Holy crap! My brother really hit the jackpot!"


Megan leaned close and whispered, "Looks like that Lewis-Lee family marriage isn't happening anymore."


Rachel beamed. "You're awesome, sis!"


At that moment, Mia hurried over and handed over Megan's clutch. "Lila, your phone's been buzzing non-stop."Megan grabbed her purse and pulled out her phone.



An unknown number kept calling non-stop.


She finally picked up, and a panicked, muffled voice came through, "Sis... don't come... Molly's lost it..."


The smile on Megan's face disappeared at once.That was Chloe's voice-she was sure of it.


A glance at the time told her school had just let out. Her first thought? Chloe had been kidnapped by Molly.


"Well well, look at you, my superstar sis! LiMo,huh?That contest was wild!"



Megan's eyes turned cold. "What do you want?"


"Old car lot out west. Come alone. Bring the cops or Tristan, and I'll make her pay, big time."


Megan's lips pressed into a thin line. "Fine. I'll comne.But if she so much as loses a hair-you're dead."


A low, sinister laugh answered her, "You think you're in control now? Please."


Then the call cut off, leaving Megan burning with rage.


She turned to Tristan. "Molly's taken Chloe."


Tristan's brows furrowed. He hadn't allowed any of the Shaw family to attend the event to avoid trouble.He'd even stationed ten bodyguards at their estate-and four more to watch over Chloe during her commutes.


How did she still get snatched?


Just then, Tristan's phone started ringing.


He answered, and Kevin's anxious voice came through. "Tristan! Chloe's gone!"


Megan immediately reached for the phone. "What happened?"


"She begged me to take her to the show. I picked her up after class and dismissed the guards... On the way, she hopped out to buy flowers, and that's when it happened-l waited forever, but she never came out."


Megan inhaled sharply, pissed off beyond words.That dumb mutt really messed up now.


She hung up and looked at Tristan. "Molly said to come alone and make the trade..."


"No way," Tristan cut in. "It's too dangerous.You're the real target here. Molly couldn't have pulled this Nova Tech off alone-someone's behind her."



Megan reached out and held his hand. "I know it's risky,but I have to go."


Tristan stared at the stubborn gleam in her eyes and relented. He brushed her hair gently. "Fine. But I'm coming too."


She nodded-it was the only compromise he'd make.If she refused, she wasn't getting anywhere.


"They're probably watching us. We'll take separate cars. You follow close behind."


Rachel tugged at Megan's arm. "I'm coming too!"


"Don't be ridiculous," Tristan snapped,then turned to Kai. "Make sure she gets home."


With that, Megan and Tristan's figures slipped away,disappearing from the crowd's view.
###Chapter 91 I'm Game
The once-bright moon was now hidden behind thick clouds, castng a heavy, suffocating gloom over the capital.


Tristan and Megan hurried out of the convention center.


A sleek black Maybach idled at the curb, where Mr.Brown stepped out and opened the door with a respectful nod.


Just as Megan was about to get in, Tristan slid his arm around her waist, pulled her close, and kissed her passionately.


He leaned in, voice low next to her ear. "There's a secret compartment under the front passenger seat.Full of different handguns. I'll show you how to use them now."

 
Megan met his gaze, calm and steady. "I already know."



That caught him off guard. The woman in his arms grew more mysterious by the second-like a puzzle he desperately wanted to solve, piece by piece.


A grin tugged at the corner of his mouth. "When did you pick that up?"


"Two years ago. I joined a shooting club," Megan said smoothly, without a flicker of hesitation. "What about you? When did you learn?"


"After you started showing up in my dreams."


Her cheeks turned red in an instant. That line had another meaning she couldn't ignore.


She lightly punched his firm chest. "Can you not?"


"Can't promise that. But I never miss. Dead-on, every time."



Megan shot him a side-eye at the shameless comeback. "Cut the nonsense-I'm getting in."


"I'll be right behind you." As she got into the Maybach, Tristan headed for the Bentley Cameron had brought around.


They both merged swiftly into traffic, fading into the rush of night.


Megan suddenly felt her passenger seat vibrating.Glancing over, she picked up her phone. An unfamiliar number lit up the screen.


Turning on the recorder, she answered.


A distorted, robotic voice came through the line."Lose the car tailing you."


"Who are you?"


"Not important. All you need to know is you're completely under my control now. New address-abandoned lot out east. Come alone, or you'll be picking up what's left of Chloe."


Click. The call ended. No doubt now-someone had eyes on her.


Megan's heart tightened. She couldn't risk Chloe's life. Not for anything.


Two black cars drove about two hundred meters apart.


Megan dialed Tristan's number. "Hey babe, how about a little race? Let's see who's faster on this stretch."



Tristan, his voice relaxed through his earpiece,chuckled. "I'm game."


Both cars took off down the highway like twin shadows,neck and neck.


Then-out of nowhere-Megan took a sharp right at an exit ramp.


"Sweetheart, what are you doing?"


Tristan's voice, now anxious, spilled through the speaker. Her nose stung, tears threatening.


She wasn't the emotional type. Not after everything she'd been through in her last life. She'd come to value this second chance at happiness. But she couldn't build her peace on someone else's blood.



Her voice wavered, thick. "Tristan. no matter what happens to me, take care of yourself."


"I'm flipping around right now to come get you."



Her eyes blurred. "Love you."



Then she hung up.


As the highway fed into a quieter back road, Megan pulled over and turned off the engine. Working fast,she took off her phone case and under the car's light, removed the tracking device hidden inside,tossing it out the window.


Just like Tristan had said, she found the hidden compartment under the passenger seat-in it, a stash of high-end firearms.Glock 17, Colt M2000, SIG P229...


Megan picked an M9 and slid in a mag loaded with 9mm Parabellum rounds. The engine roared to life.


The black Maybach shot out like a bullet from a gun.


Tristan stared at the red dot on his phone map,but when he rushed to that location, it was already deserted.


Gripping the steering wheel tight, he instantly realized the little troublemaker had dumped the tracker.


Pulling up an app, he tapped into his smart assistant system to locate Nova Tech.


Because that dumb dog was currently tucked away in Megan's purse.


He hadn't given it to her for fun-he'd planned for moments like this.


Staring at the flickering red dot zipping across the map, a fire sparked in his narrowed eyes.


"Megan, if you're in, we're in this together."


With smooth precision, he shifted gears, stepped hard on the gas in his custom leather shoes, and sped straight toward East Suburb's abandoned car lot.



At the same time, Kevin was pacing furiously-he couldn't find any trace of Tristan or Megan, not even using SkyEye.


No clue what tricks they pulled, but their profiles had gone completely off-grid.


He was getting so anxious, it looked like he might combust on the spot.


Then Kai's call came through-he'd faintly overheard someone mention the Western abandoned lot.


Like a switch flipped, Kevin practically flew out,taking his team straight to the west side.


Cool night wind cut through the dusk, scattering dark clouds, and that glowing silver moon hovered like a dagger in the sky.


In the East Suburb junkyard, rows of scrapped cars stood still, some stacked dangerously like they were ready to topple.


Megan parked exactly where Molly told her-between two rows of rusting wrecks.


She unzipped her purse and out popped Nova Tech.


In its usual baby-robot voice, it chirped, "Goddess,are we, like. walking into our doom?"


Megan grabbed a roll of duct tape and secured the gun snugly against her inner thigh. With a faint smile,she replied,"Scared?"


Nova gave a little shake-well, more like a wiggle."Scared of what? If you're not scared, I'd bea crappy excuse for a guard dog to be!"


Megan let out a chuckle. "You literally are a dog. Who taught you to talk like that-cuss words and all?"


"Zeta Prime did!"


The answer shot out instantly-no hesitation at all.


She flicked its head lightly with her finger. "Hide under my skirt for now." Nova giggled, "If I get a view of my pretty human's glowing white thighs, my master's gonna scrap me for sure!"


She hoisted it up. "Relax, I'll make sure your metal head stays attached."


Lifting her dress, she clipped Nova securely underneath.



As she pushed the car door open, a cold gust mixed with the sting of rust rushed in.


Closing the door behind her, Megan's eyes swept the surroundings, alert as ever.


A drone buzzed overhead, circling around.


Just then, her phone shook.


"Still got guts, huh? Head straight, then take a right at the first intersection, right again at the second,and another right at the first one after that..."


She frowned."Seriously? That's just a full circle."


"Hahaha. So what if it is? If you don't play along, that little tramp gets gang-handled."


Hearing Molly's twisted threats, Megan had no choice but to comply.


After the loop, she found herself right where she'd started.





Molly's voice came again. "Go straight, take a left at the end-there's a warehouse. Get in."


Megan clenched her teeth tight, the tension pressing hard in her jaw.


Then, without hesitation, she darted forward.
 ###Chapter 92 Who The Hell Are You
Megan stood in front of the factory, the place swallowed in darkness.


She narrowed her eyes, just as two tall figures stepped into the moonlight.


With nasty grins and crass laughter, the two men swaggered toward her.


"Hot damn, look at this chick."


"Bet she feels amazing to touch."


Just as their hands reached out toward her, Megan struck-her high heel slammed right into one guy's crotch.



The other one went for his gun.


Megan grabbed his wrist, twisted it downward-"crack!"-his arm dislocated.



The gun dropped to the ground.


A flick of her toe sent the weapon flipping into her hand.



She jammed the barrel straight into the guy's mouth and turned to the other, now on his knees.Her voice was like ice. "How many people inside?"



"Bitch!" the man spat.



Without a flinch, Megan yanked the barrel out and shoved it into the second man's mouth. Slight angle,pull the trigger.


Blood sprayed into the wet dirt, already dull and lifeless underfoot.


The silencer muffled the shot, but the man's screams said enough.


She calmly shot through his arms and legs, leaving him crumpled on the ground, writhing.


Then she turned to the guy still standing,pressing the steaming muzzle against his temple."Talk."


He shivered violently. "Just... hostages and that crazy woman, plus ten-twelve more guys. Please,we were hired, that's all!"



Megan's brows furrowed. "Hired? You two? You're not with the rest of them?"



The guy shook his head like mad. "No, no! She's the one who paid us-to, uh, do that to the girl. We don't even know the others-"



His words were cut off.



A bullet ripped through his forehead.



His body folded backward like a broken puppet.



Megan's head snapped toward the sound. She caught a flicker of movement-someone ducking behind an old, rusted car. A sniper. That guy had been there all along.


If they'd wanted her dead, she'd be lying cold already. Who's behind this twisted game?


Her phone buzzed. Megan answered.


A distorted voice came on, almost giggling. "Tsk tsk,you're toosoft-hearted."


Megan's grip on the phone tightened. "Who the hell are you? Did you take Molly and Wyatt ? Are you using Molly to come at me? What are you even trying to do?"



Laughter spilled through the speaker. "Four questions right off the bat, impressive. But I'll answer only the last one."



"What do you want?"



"You."



Megan's tongue ran across her back teeth. Yep, this one was just screwing with her.


Her jaw twitched. "Screw off."



More laughter. "Oh, don't worry. Got a nice gift coming your way." She hung up and stepped over the body, entering the factory.


The second she crossed the threshold, the lights snapped on with a blinding glare.


She squinted against it.


Molly sat comfortably on a worn leather chair,acting like she owned the place.


Twelve men in suits stood behind her, bult like tanks.


Just above them, Chloe hung in the air, wrists bound,mouth gagged with a cloth.


"Bitch, drop the gun. Get on your knees."


Molly's eyes were venomous,filled with hate.


When Megan didn't move, she snapped.


She yelled at one of the suited men, and Chloe was hoisted another meter higher.


Now she was dangling like three stories up.


"I said get down, or I'll lift her till she drops and  dies!"Megan looked up at Chloe,who was shaking her head frantically, tears gushing down her cheeks.


She gave a faint smile, tossed her gun forward,and dropped to her knees.


Molly let out a crazed laugh, quickly getting to her feet and striding straight toward Megan with an impatient look.



As she got close, the manic grin grew on her face.Standing over Megan, she raised her foot and aimed to kick her in the chest.


Megan reacted fast-she grabbed Molly's leg and twisted it hard.



With a scream, Molly crashed to the floor sideways,her voice echoing through the empty warehouse.


Megan yanked her up by the hair, forcing Molly's head back.



She pulled a handgun from the inside of her thigh and pressed it against the back of Molly's skull,hoisting her up as a shield. Using Molly as cover, Megan fixed her eyes on the suited men who had drawn their weapons. "Let the girl go. Or I shoot her right here."


One of the suited men picked up a call and put it on speaker.


A distorted voice chuckled mockingly, "Go ahead.Pull the trigger."


Molly screamed in panic. "No, wait! You still need me!I don't wanna die!"



The voice on the phone added, "Megan, this won't be our last meeting. Keep my last answer in mind."


The armed men slowly backed off, pocketing their weapons.



With a swift kick, Megan sent Molly sprawling face-first into the dirt.


Then, rapid gunfire erupted outside the warehouse.


Megan immediately thought-Tristan must be here.


She crouched down and gave Molly a sharp chop to  the neck, knocking her out cold.


She rushed over to the ropes holding Chloe,loosening them bit by bit and untying the restraints around her wrists.



The ropes had left angry red marks on Chloe's wrists, the skin barely hanging on.


She had been strung up for too long, gagged and struggling to breathe.


As Megan pulled the cloth from Chloe's mouth,she gasped for air like a fish out of water.


Then, breaking into sobs, Chloe flung herself into Megan's arms. "Meg, I told you not to come! What if something happened to you?"


Megan's mind flashed back to the brutal photos she'd seen in her past life-Chloe's mangled body.That kind of end? Not this time.



She gently stroked Chloe's cheek. "Be good. Stay here-I need to go check outside."
"I'm coming with you."


Megan frowned. "No. You stay put and watch Molly."


She picked up the pistol she'd tossed earlier,handed it to Chloe, and pulled the safety. "Take this. If she so much as twitches,shoot."



Then Megan got up and bolted out of the warehouse.


The sound of bullets tearing through metal rang in her ears.



Megan ducked behind an old pickup truck.


She couldn't call Tristan. If he got distracted, he might get killed.


"Nova Tech, take me to your master."


Nova peeked out from under her skirt. "But Master said Nova's job is to keep Little Fairy safe, not bring you into dangerous places."


"Move it or I'm blasting you into scrap right now."


Nova flapped her metal wings, lifted off, circled twice overhead, and finally flew east.


Megan stayed low, running in the direction Nova flew.


The gunfire suddenly stopped.


She crouched behind a battered Volkswagen.


Nova was nowhere in sight.


The air was thick and still. A strong metallic scent of blood floated in, hitting Megan's nose and turning her stomach.


She scanned around carefully, the only sound her own breathing.


She took one slow step back-and suddenly froze.


Something cold and round was pressing hard into her lower back.
###Chapter 93 Molly ls Finally Offline
The silver moonlight was swallowed by the clouds again, and a chilly drizzle had started to fall.


Megan gripped her M9 tightly, eyes sweeping around with caution. She took a step back, only to feel something cold and hard press against her lower back.



She didn't dare to move-if the idiot behind her pulled the trigger, that'd be it.


A clean death was one thing. What she couldn't bear was ending up paralyzed-alive,but barely.


Raindrops clung to her thick lashes, trembling as she blinked. The icy wetness trailed down her pale cheek.


An arm suddenly slid around her collarbone,locking onto her shoulder. A wave of warm breath brushed against her neck. "Scared?" a familiar, seductive voice murmured close to her ear.


Megan's eyes darted sideways in shock.


Then soft lips pressed against hers, warm tongue slipping past her teeth, boldly claiming space that once belonged only to her.


Her legs turned to jelly, and the metallic taste of blood hit her senses.


Frowning, she tried pushing him away. "You're hurt?"


"Just a scratch."



She turned toward Tristan and caught him before he lost his balance. He let out a low grunt.


Her palm came away wet and sticky. When she glanced at her hand, it was stained a darker shade.


"Your left shoulder's bleeding."


"Took a bullet. I'm fine. They didn't make it out."


Her heart clenched. She helped him up gently."We  need to find Chloe first, then I'll get you to a hospital."


Just then, Nova Tech zoomed through the rain,circling anxiously.



Its voice sounded rushed and high-pitched: "Ugly woman's up! She's got the pretty girl now-took her hostage. I didn't goin, not sure I can pull this off."


Megan and Tristan rushed back to the warehouse.They stepped inside to see Molly looking wild, gun aimed at Chloe's temple like a scene from hell.


At the sight of them, Molly laughed maniacally.


"Want to save her? Trade your life for hers!"



Chloe's cheeks were streaked with tears, but her stare was steady. She might be scared, but if saving herself meant losing her sister? No way.


"Go on then-shoot me if you've got the guts," she snapped.


Molly yanked Chloe's collar tight, making her face  flush. She hissed, "None of you are getting out of this."



Megan slowly raised her hands, "Molly, don't do this-I'll switch places with her. Just let her go."


She stepped forward, her voice calm. "There's no need for this. Let Chloe go-no police, I'll getyou out of the country.Deal?"


"Don't move! I'm not stupid-I know you've trained in all that fight stuff. I can't win against you!"


Molly dragged Chloe back another step, eyes burning, "You ruined me! You think I'm walking away from this quietly?"



She pointed her gun at Tristan now.


"You-break her arms and legs. Or I blow her head off."



Tristan's stare turned deadly cold. Something dangerous flickered in his eyes-rage, hatred...darkness. Megan had never seen him like this. He dragged his tongue slowly across his teeth and spat out,"Keep dreaming."


Molly snapped, jamming the gun harder against Chloe's temple.


"You think I won't?"


Without warning, Tristan hurled his gun to the ground and stepped in front of Megan, shielding her with his whole body.


"Take me instead. Let them go."



Molly broke into hysterics.


"Tristan, I never thought you'd end up here. I begged for your attention, and you never looked my way! You made me suffer-now it's your turn to know what that feels like!"She aimed the gun straight at Tristan, but just as her finger tightened on the trigger, a flash of blue light struck her index finger.


That trigger finger instantly burned as if scorched,and a gut-wrenching scream echoed through the factory ceiling.  With a swift move, Tristan lunged forward and kicked Molly several meters away.


Blood gushed from Molly's mouth as she hunched over, clutching her stomach and curling her legs inward in pain.


Chloe bolted back and grabbed onto Megan's arm tightly.


At the same moment, Nova Tech landed lightly on Megan's shoulder. "Nova nailed the sneak attack!Nova rules, way better than that bonehead Zeta Prime!"



Megan couldn't help but chuckle. This silly thing really only liked to compete with Zeta Prime.


She gently comforted Chloe, then walked over to Molly, now barely holding it together. "I was ready to let this go, but you just kept pushing. Guess you'll be spending your days behind bars now."


Molly's face was drenched in sweat, twisted in agony.Bloodshot eyes glared up at Megan with pure venom. "You bitch...you'll rot in hell."


With that, Molly began to writhe in pain, her fingernails digging deep into her own neck as blood streamed down her skin.



Suddenly, she clutched at her chest and began vomiting blood violently.


Tristan immediately sensed something was wrong.He pulled Megan close and stepped back a full meter.



Molly's body was jerking uncontrollably. Veins bulged at her temples, and her sclera turned a horrifying blood-red.


Then-just like that-she stopped moving.Her chest no longer rose or fell.


"She's... dead?" Megan murmured, stunned.


She genuinely didn't get it. How could just one kick from Tristan kill someone?


Molly's eyes, filled with blood, stayed wide open-  locked on the factory roof above her.


A tiny black object, the size of a bean, crawled out of her nostril.


Just as it spread its dark wings to take off, Nova snatched it midair at lightning speed.


"Nova, don't squash it," Megan warned.



Nova let out a few concerned whines. "Nova scanned it-this black bug's vitals are zero. It's already toast."


Nova hovered over to Tristan and Megan, opening its paw to reveal the bug, now a splattered mess oozing dark fluid.



"What the hell is that?" Megan asked.


Tristan squinted. "Looks like... a sorcery worm."


A chill ran through Megan, goosebumps crawling over her skin.


She'd heard whispers of sorcery worms being used to kill-but seeing it in real life was something else entirely. Brutal. Horrific.


Just then, her phone vibrated. The call was from an unknown number again.


She answered and switched to speaker. A distorted voice came through.


"Did you ike the little gift I sent you?"


"What was the point of sending Molly to kidnap Chloe?" Megan asked, brows furrowed.


"Just wanted you to have this present. And... maybe get a glimpse of you," the voice teased, the creepy flirtation in their tone impossible to miss.


Megan's stomach turned. She was sure now-someone had been watching her, closely.


She scanned the area, searching for any sign of surveillance.


"No use. You won't find me. But don't worry... we'll meet.Sooner or later."


The call ended. Megan let out a pissed sigh. "Sick  freak."


Chloe asked, confused, "Wait, does that person...like you or something?"


Tristan's face darkened at the idea. "This is way more complicated than that."


Megan called the cops, and forty minutes later,police cars and ambulances arrived at the abandoned lot in the eastern suburbs.



But right then, a man with blood-red eyes burst into the warehouse.
 ###Chapter 94 The Classic Make-Her-Feel-Bad Move
"Kev! Kev!"


Chloe waved her slim little hand as soon as she spotted Kevin with his hair all messy like he'd just wrestled a tornado.


Kevin dashed over, arms spread wide like he was about to scoop the tiny girl into a hug-only to feel his collar yank back hard. No matter how he leaned,he just couldn't get to her.


He twitched a smile, glancing sideways. Megan stared at him with a smirk, clearly entertained.


"Don't you think those arms of yours are reaching a little too far?"


Kevin took a step back, not even bothering to argue."Didn't manage to hug her. Guess they're still too short."
Then his gaze landed on Tristan, blood staining his shirt. His eyes flew open. "Damn! You got shot? Who did it?!"


Tristan's face was tight. "No clue. Got a smoke?"


Kevin fished a pack and a silver lighter from his suit pocket, handing them over.


Tristan slid a cigarette out, lit it with a flick, the flame tinting the tip red. He took a deep drag and exhaled through gritted teeth. "They used some kind of Sorcery worm."


"What the hell?!" Kevin's expression flipped. "Who died?"



Chloe pointed at the ghastly corpse on the ground."Molly."


"Good riddance," Kevin muttered, shooting the body a disgusted look.


Just then, Ryan strode in. "Mr. Reid, we need you to come down to the station and help with the investigation."  Megan kept calm. "He's got a bullet wound. Let him get treated first. We'll come in tomorrow."


Ryan gave a nod. "Got it."


Tristan gave a faint smirk. "Kinda been running into you a lot lately,Captain."


Ryan held back a sigh. These two? Wherever they went, chaos followed. Practically magnetized to crime scenes.


Then he remembered what Tristan said earlier."Mr.Reid, did you say Molly was killed by a sorcery worm?"


"Yeah. Nova, hand the evidence to Captain Mitchell."


Nova floated over to Ryan. He quickly called over the coroner to bring an evidence bag.


When they opened it, Nova tossed in a clump of black something.


"That's it?" Ryan's eye twitched.


"It self-destructed," Tristan replied. Ryan swallowed hard. "Yikes. That's rough. My old mentor told me about a similar case-used sorcery worms too. But that one went cold, what, twenty years ago?"


Tristan dropped the cigarette, grinding it out under his boot. His face was shadowed in smoke. "Guess that cold case is about to heat up again."


Ryan's face darkened. He knew Tristan never said anything without a reason.


His mentor had warned him-some big figures were involved back then. That's why the case got buried.


And if it really came back now, it'd shake everything up.


Tristan slung an arm over Megan's shoulder and started walking out of the warehouse. But then he paused, glanced back. "Send me the autopsy reports for Molly and the others."


Ryan stared at the black evidence in the bag. "Will do." Kevin rubbed his hands together. "Uh. Chloe, you cold or something?"


Chloe nodded seriously.


Kevin's face lit up as he moved to drape an arm around her shoulders.


Before he could touch her, the little thing tugged his jacket right off and wrapped herself in it.


Kevin sniffed, watching her bounce off. "That.didn't go like it was supposed to."


Ryan chuckled, seeing Kevin's lost-face expression."Aren't you, like, way older than her?"


Kevin shot him a deadly glare. "So what if I like younger girls? Got a problem? Keep it to yourself."


Then he chased after that skipping figure. "Chloe,your wrist got all scraped up-I'll blow on it for you."


Ryan scratched the back of his head. "I never said you were old, man, just older than her. Why so defensive?" Dreamscape Manor.Hearing the sound of an engine,Zeta Prime was already standing at the villa entrance like a statue, waiting anxiously.



The moment Tristan and Megan got out of the car,it rushed toward them.



But as it got closer, it paused. "Zeta Prime detects a 9mm Parabellum lodged in the master's shoulder.Alert: injury detected!"


Nova Tech fluttered down onto its head. "Master took on twelve guys solo. None made it out."


Zeta Prime's eyes flashed. "Minor injury on our side,full wipeout on theirs. Solid win."


Tristan shot it a cold glare. "Zip it, or you're getting scrapped."


Translation: Don't go snitching to Mr. Reid.


Zeta Prime swatted Nova Tech off its head."Detected unidentified substance on Nova's clawS.Identity?" "Bug poop!" Nova chirped.


Zeta Prime flailed its robot hands over its head. "Oh no! My reputation! I've been defiled!"



Ignoring the robots' drama, Tristan and Megan hurried back into the villa and headed straight to their room.



Five minutes later, Max Adams, the private doctor,arrived.



Tristan's white shirt was soaked through with blood-looked seriously bad.



Max carefully snipped open the shirt. The bullet was deep in his shoulder.



He reached for the anesthetic, but Tristan stopped him."Did you forget? I don't react to anesthetics."


Max froze."Seriously?"


Cameron, just arriving, caught that. Eyes blinking.Wait,when did he become immune to anesthetics?That was news to him. "Sir, Amelia was bailed out by her dad."


Tristan buried his head in Megan's arms and gave a quiet "Mm." "Let it be. The Reids can't afford a fallout with the Lewises. She's had her lesson."


Max dabbed the surrounding blood away with iodine-soaked gauze, cleaning the area slowly.


Because the bullet was so deep, he had to use a scalpel to open it up more.


"Tristan, I'll need to widen the cut a bit. Brace yourself," Max warned.


Tristan's other arm wrapped around Megan's waist."It's fine.I can take it."



Max sighed. What is he trying to prove?


He began cutting; the sound of blade on flesh made everyone tense.


Tristan's brow furrowed, cold sweat trailing down the contours of his defined back.


Even the veins at his temple popped from the pain. Megan couldn't bear to watch. She clutched his head close,heart aching.


The man nestled in her arms curled his lips ever so slightly."Tss.hurts."


Max nearly dropped the scalpel in shock.


Cameron's jaw hung low. "Should we maybe try a tiny bit of anesthesia? Who knows, maybe it works this time?"



Tristan's sharp gaze silenced any further thoughts.


Cameron finally got it-this was all an act. A pain act.The classic "make-her-feel-bad" move.



Tristan kept groaning in pain the whole time, and Max felt his own nerves stretch thin. Still, he managed to extract the bullet and stitch him up.



The bullet landed in the disposal tray with a clink.Max exhaled in relief.


As he packed up to leave, he turned at the door with a grin. "No intense movement for a while." Megan blushed instantly, mumbling under her breath.


Tristan shot Cameron a side glance. "Do you need something else?"


"N-nope." Cameron bounced out of the room like he was escaping a fire.


Tristan tilted his head up, looking at Megan. "Megan,it hurts."


She gently wiped the sweat off his forehead. "I'll go find you a painkiller."


But just as she was about to walk away, Tristan pulled her into his arms and onto his lap.


Eyes glowing, he murmured, "You're my medicine."

###Chapter 95 That Calls for Some Punishment
The spacious room was filled with nothing but the sound of their mingled, uneven breaths.


Megan suddenly realized something was off about Tristan.



Her hazy eyes widened; she pressed her palms against his firm chest. "Dr. Adams said you shouldn't be doing anything too intense right now."


Tristan's nose brushed against her jaw, lingering at the curve of her neck. His voice came out low and hoarse."Ifeel...really hot."


Megan could feel the heat radiating off him too. She reached up and touched his forehead. "You've got a fever."


"No, I don't," Tristan murmured, lips brushing across her collarbone, "I'm just thirsty. Really thirsty. For  you."


His burning hand slid up her fair arm, and then moved down her leg, starting to lift her dress.


Megan caught his hand. "Quit it. You're really burning up."


She slipped from his arms and stood up. "I'm getting you something for the fever. And I'll run a bath. Just sit tight."


From the walk-in closet, she pulled out a first-aid kit and found the anti-inflammatory pills. Then she filled a glass with warm water from the dispenser and returned to the bed.


Tristan was sitting on the edge, leaning forward,his forearms resting on his knees. He looked up at her,eyes still dark with heat.


Staring at the cup she handed him, he gave a lazy smile."Kinda hot."


Hot? Megan took a sip to check. "It's warm. You'll be fine." He popped the pill into his mouth and stared at the lipstick mark left on the rim. His eyes darkened as he followed the imprint, pressing his lips right onto the same spot. With a deep gulp, he swallowed the water and the pill.


Megan quickly averted her gaze. The way he looked at her-it didn't feel like he'd just drunk water. It was like he just devoured her whole.



She took the glass and hurried off into the bathroom.



As she watched the water rise in the tub, her lips pressed into a tight line.



He gave up his life for her in a past life.


Now, once again, he didn't think twice about risking it all to save her.


The thought of that bullet being just a few centimeters lower sent a chill down her spine.


Her hands clenched tightly at her sides.


Then suddenly-warmth. He pulled her back into his arms, head lowered close to her ear. "What's on your mind? Hmm?"


She snapped out of it, just in time to realize the bathwater was about to spill over. She reached for the knob.


But Tristan held her in place. "Megan, just stay.Let me hold you for a bit."


He did seem unusually clingy tonight.


"The water's gonna overflow," she mumbled.


His fingers gently brushed her cheek before he leaned down to kiss her. His breath was burning against her skin.


Long fingers slipped past the neckline of her sparkly dress.



A surge of emotion rushed through her-like her heart was being tickled by feathers-thoroughly disarming.



She didn't even notice when her dress slipped off and hit the floor. Tristan's lips explored the sensitive vein on her neck,his voice raspy.



Then she suddenly felt something hard press against her waist-her scalp tingled.


Dr. Adams said physical activity wasn't a good idea in his condition, especially not with a fever.



She lifted her hand and gently pinched Tristan's chin."How about...another time?"



He chuckled lowly. "Then bathe with me."


Before she could say no, he had already scooped her up into his arms and stepped straight into the tub.


He didn't do anything else-just held her in his arms as his lips lingered on her spine.


"How'd you find me?" she asked.


A smirk tugged at his lips. "Take a guess."She'd already ditched the bug, and thanks to the top-tier firewall she'd installed on her phone, no one was getting into her system. So whatever was going on, it  wasn't related to her directly.


Turning her head slightly, she asked, "Was it NNova Tech?"


Tristan tapped the tip of her nose with a smirk."Sharp as ever, little fox."


She rolled her eyes. "Giving me that bot was more about keeping tabs on me than keeping me safe,admit it."


"I can't let anything happen to you," he said, turning her toward him so they were face to face. "Megan,if something ever happened to you, I wouldn't want to go on either."


She quickly pressed a hand to his lips. "Don't. Don't say stuff like that."


"I mean it," Tristan said firmly, wrapping his hand around her wrist.


How could she not believe him? In their past life,he had pushed a military blade into his own chest right after she'd died-no hesitation, no second thoughts. Megan's nose started to tingle, and before she could stop herself, hot tears streamed down her cheeks."I know," she whispered. "I know you mean every word."



With a gentle touch, Tristan used his finger to catch a tear. He chuckled softly. "Even someone like you,with tear ducts that barely work, is tearing up. Are my words that touching?"



Snuggling closer into the curve of his collarbone,Megan sighed. "It's not just what you say. it's all the things you've done. Tristan, thank you."


"Say three different words-I'd like that better."


"Thank you?"


"Huh?"



"I miss you."


Tristan's hand tightened around her waist. "Wrong again. That calls for some punishment."


"You're awful!" she pouted. Then he started tickling her, making her shriek with laughter.


"Okay, okay! I give! I'll say it!" Megan's arms locked around his neck as she grinned, breathless. "Tristan,I love you. I really, really do."


Just as Tristan cupped her cheeks to kiss her,she splashed a handful of foam into his face.


She quickly scooted to the far side of the tub. "Dr.Max said you're not supposed to do anything too intense,remember?"


Caught off guard, Tristan threw her a look and muttered something under his breath.


The smile froze on Megan's lips. Wait, what did he just say? That was definitely crossing the line.


After their bath, they both slipped into robes and made their way back to the bedroom.


Seeing that his bandage had gotten wet, Megan carefully re-cleaned the wound with iodine before wrapping it again with fresh gauze. She tucked him in, then climbed into bed beside him.


"You know that murder case Ryan mentioned...about the killer bugs? You've heard of it, right?"


"Yeah."



"Tell me."


Lying in the dark, Tristan's eyes glinted with a serious edge. He narrowed them slightly and began to explain.



See, the difference between a regular rich family and a financial conglomerate is influence and control.Conglomerates are tied up in monopolies, bloodlines,spanning industries, and messy ties with politics.They don't just have money-they've got power. Real power. And they use family ties and internal stock shares to keep things locked tight.


A powerful dispute over the next leader's position started this twisted war among the four big families.In the aftermath, the Richmond family was completely wiped out. The Reid and Lewis families aligned, while the Channing and Bennett families formed their own alliance. Both sides were evenly matched, making the neutral Richmond family the balancing piece on the board.


Each alliance tried persuading the Richmond family,but they didn't budge.


Still, the Richmond family wasn't blind; they knew that if they didn't choose a side, they'd end up with every other family turning against them.


The night before the final vote, the Richmonds made a call. They sided with the Reids and the Lewises.


Maybe someone within leaked the info, because that same night, all sixteen members of the Richmond family-excluding staff-died from a fatal, sorcery worm.And the bodies...completely destroyed, as if they'd been soaked in acid. Total horror show.


That's how the infamous sorcery worm murder case became etched into history.

###Chapter 96 There Is Only One Truth
Megan felt a chill run down her spine after listening.She burrowed a little closer into Tristan's comforting arms. "Including the staff, how many died?"


Tristan sighed, voice low and heavy. "Thirty-six. Even the one-year-old heir of the Richmond family didn't make it."



"That's... horrible," Megan frowned, heart tightening."They didn't even spare a baby. Was it the Channing Family and the Bennette Family behind it?"


Tristan tightened his hold on her. "There's no solid lead. No one knows how the sorcery worm was planted. The suspicions all point to the Channing and Bennette families, yeah, but there's no real proof.And the Reid and Lewis families aren't off the hook either. We promised the Richmond family protection,and in the end, it was all just empty talk." "So... the Richmond family got sacrificed by all four?""Judging from the outcome, that's basically it."


"Ryan said someone powerful's involved. Who is it?"



Tristan let out a cold laugh. "The President's younger brother-Nathaniel Cooper."



Megan blinked. "Wait. did he try to compete with his own brother for the presidency?"


"Yeah," Tristan's fingers gently glided over her soft skin. "In politics, family ties don't mean much. The Reid and Lewis families have backed Charles Cooper for five elections now. Next January, there's another tough one coming."


Megan raised an eyebrow. "So Nathaniel still won't quit? That guy just doesn't give up."


Tristan's eyes flickered with a strange light. "Guess this sorcery worm thing isn't just a random case.It's probably a warning, or maybe-"


"Maybe what?" she looked up, curiosity in her eyes.  He raised a hand to ruffle her hair, but winced as pain shot through his wound. "Damn, that hurts."


His whiny tone made her purse her lips. He didn't say a word back in the bathtub when he was so energetic. Now suddenly he's acting fragile?


"You know, they say kissing triggers endorphins.Works like a natural painkiller. A good one can equal a pill. Plus, during a kiss, your body releases dopamine-it makes you happy and reduces pain.The more intense, the higher the dose."


"Then just let it hurt," she poked around his wound deliberately. "What were you gonna say? Maybe what?"



"Maybe it's a death warning," he said, pinching her chin."Scared?"



Megan shook her head, cool as always. "Nope."


Suddenly something clicked in her mind. She slipped out of his arms, jumped off the bed, and grabbed her laptop, phone, and data cable from the table. Back under the covers, sitting up against the headboard, she got right to work. She connected the phone and started transferring the distorted audio file.



Her fingers flew across the keyboard, code lines running across the black screen in white.


An audio clip began loading and processing.


Tristan watched her, intrigued by how focused she was. With a side glance, he chuckled softly."Seriously, what else are you hiding from me, huh?"


"That's it," Megan grinned, mischief dancing behind her sly, fox-like eyes, full of hidden secrets just waiting to be uncovered.


"That so? Just remember, lying to me doesn't end well."Megan tilted her head, brow arched. "How bad are we talking?"


Tristan slid a warm hand around her waist. "Bad enough your back's gonna remember it."


Leaning in close, he grazed her earlobe with his  teeth, his voice low and teasing. "I've got no chill tonight."


Megan's lips twitched. The guy had been all about self-control before-and she'd been the one always poking the bear. But now that he was ready to stop holding back, she suddenly felt like running.


Just then, a damp breath brushed her ear and sent tiny shivers down her spine. A deep, slightly distorted male voice broke the tension-the converted audio from the voice changer had finished processing.



The voice was smooth with a faint softness, almost charming.


"Sounds like someone around our age," Tristan muttered, frowning. "Still doesn't tell us much. Just keep your ears open-see if anyone you run into talks like that."



Megan closed her laptop with a sigh. "The clip's t00short to trace him. Even if we did figure out the source, odds are he's long gone." Tristan just hummed in response, brushing a kiss against her forehead. "Get some sleep. I'm hitting the study to dig into some files."


He grabbed his phone, threw on a robe, and walked out.



Once inside the study, Tristan went straight to a bookshelf and pulled out a brown envelope. He sank into the leather chair, flipping slowly through copied pages and black-and-white photo prints. The air practically reeked of death.


He reached for his phone and called Ryan. "Got the autopsy report yet?"


"I was just about to call you."


Tristan opened the drawer of the red mahogany desk, pulled out a pack of Zhonghua cigarettes,flicked open a silver lighter, and lit one up. The flame lit the tip while smoke curled from the end.



He wasn't a regular smoker-only when things got seriously messed up. Taking a deep drag, he exhaled sharply. "Hit me."


"Molly's heart was full of holes. Eaten away, like by worms. The tissue sample you gave me came straight from her heart. Exact same cause of death as the Richmond family twenty-five years ago."



Tristan tapped off the ash with a flick. "So you think the same person's behind both?"


Ryan didn't answer right away. "It's possible. But look, boss. that case from back then? Big names were involved. People way above my pay grade.The guy they say pulled the strings is the Minister of Defense now. If I dig too deep, I could drop dead tomorrow without knowing what hit me."



Tristan's eyes narrowed a bit. "My wife once got a call from someone using a voice changer. Once we reversed it, it turned out to be a young man. If Nathaniel Cooper really had something to say, l doubt he'd just send a cryptic warning."


"You're thinking someone else is pulling the strings?"  Tristan crushed the cigarette into the ashtray. "Yeah.This isn't over. The guy will make another move.What's the latest on those suit-wearing guys?"


"Oh,right-meant to tell you. Those bodies we found?Exploded in transit. Turns out they had miniature bombs implanted. And the two outside the warehouse-you know, one didn't make it, the other's barely hanging on. Took a bullet straight through the cheek, legs and arms are toast. But. he's threatening to sue your wife."



Tristan let out a cold laugh. "Guess he's tired of living."



He hung up and lit another cigarette, frowning deeply.


Could Nathaniel Cooper really be behindit?


Trying to clear the competition before the election,scare them first, then take them out?


Didn't feel right.


The power behind the Reid and Lewis families still  dwarfed the Bennette and Channing families.Nathaniel would know drawing this much attention would only burn him in the end.So, bottom line is-someone's trying to use the Reid family to get rid of Nathaniel Cooper.
###Chapter 97 Megan, We'll Be Seeing Each Other Soon
The night grew darker, and the light drizzle turned into a heavy downpour. Rain hammered against the windows, creating a rhythmic tapping sound.



Inside the lavishly decorated room, the crystal chandelier cast a cold glow, illuminating the dark-themed oil paintings on the walls. The whole place had an eerie vibe, like the air itself was too thick to breathe.



The man sat on the couch with his legs crossed,casually swirling the red wine in his crystal goblet,the smile on his lips not reaching his eyes.



A man dressed in black stepped into the room,carrying a sniper rifle case. He paused, glanced down at his soaked shoes, and frowned before quickly backing out.  Two wet footprints were left on the expensive Persian rug.


Whether it was rain or sweat, a droplet slipped down from the tip of the man's nose.


Gulping nervously, he said, "Boss, I failed the mission."



The man lifted his gaze lazily. His sharp, fox-like eyes were laced with amusement. "Tristan took out a dozen of our elite guys by himself. Impressive."


The man in black lowered his head even more. "The chip went off.Everything's gone. The Reids and the cops won't find a single clue."



The man took a slow sip of wine. His Adam's apple moved slightly as he swallowed.



The one in black couldn't read the boss's expression,and asking was definitely out of the question. He just kept stealing glances.


But the moment their eyes met, those cold,viper-like eyes made him look away instantly. The man let out a quiet laugh. "Do I really look that scary?"


Lying wouldn't end well. The guy could be gutting someone just because he woke up in a bad mood.



But admitting it? Even worse-could send him straight to hell.


He was stuck.



The man uncrossed his legs and set his glass on the coffee table.



With a calm stride, he walked over to the window and wiped away the fog on the glass with one hand.


His reflection appeared-sharp features, dangerously charming. He smiled faintly. "Didn't expect that woman to know how to handle a gun."


"Yes. Calm, accurate, and brutal."


The man suddenly turned around. "Think she's a good match for me?"


The man in black had no idea what answer was safe,  so he kept his mouth shut.


"How's Wyatt doing?"


"He's moving as planned. Took the CEO position at Robinson Group and already aligned with the Bennette and Channing families."


The man traced a faint outline of a woman's face on the window. "Wyatt's hot-headed. You're his assistant-keep him in check. Make sure he doesn't mess things up."



"Understood."



He looked at the silhouette on the foggy glass and smiled faintly. "The Lewis family will have a hard time getting that land now."


"Do you think the Reids will intervene?"


The man walked back to the couch, pulled out a cigarette from the case, lit it up, and exhaled slowly.


Through the rising smoke, he said with a faint smile,"Oliver has too much pride. He won't go begging Tristan for help. You can go."


The black-clad man nodded and left, closing the door softly behind him.


The man's gaze fell on the phone screen, where a photo of a woman wearing a dazzling starlight gown glowed.


The corners of his lips curled into a slow, wicked grin."Megan, we'll be seeing each other soon."


The next day, Tristan and Megan went to the police station for their statements.


Worried the officers might not be friendly toward her,Ryan personally handled her questioning.


Megan recounted the entire incident in detail,clearly and calmly.Other than Tristan having someone shadow Molly and Amelia, and planting a tracker and bug in her phone, there wasn't much else.


After all, following and filming police arrests without reporting it could bring about some serious consequences.  Ryan chuckled, "Mrs. Reid, are you seriously saying those videos were made by them hiring someoneto film willingly?"


Megan shrugged, putting on an innocent face."Well,with the kind of people they are, it's not shocking if someone with a strong sense of justice felt the need to expose what they've done."


Ryan stared at her, deadpan. She didn't even blink while making stuff up-dude had to give her props.



She could beat a lie detector without even trying.


"What's the verdict on Sophia and Natalie?"



Ryan answered, "Sophia got the death penalty for murder. But she's appealed."


"Hah," Megan sneered, her lips curling coldly. "She's got the nerve, I'll give her that."


Ryan frowned, confused. "What do you mean?"


"She's got a serious ego problem. Killed someone over a decade ago, then plotted the destruction of the entire Reid family, and now she thinks she can appeal? Please." Megan rubbed her fingers together."Looks like unless we keep up the pressure, she's just gonna keep wasting oxygen. What about Natalie?"


Ryan coughed lightly, "She got ten years. But yep,she's appealing too."


"Premeditated murder, serious charges-ten years is already lenient. Honestly? She should rot in there forever." Megan grabbed her handbag and stood up."If there's nothing else, Captain Mitchell, I'll be heading out."



Ryan didn't dare say much-this woman looked sweet but played hardball when needed.


He politely opened the door with a gesture. "Mrs.Reid,this way."


Megan nodded slightly and exited the interrogation room.



At the same time, Tristan stepped out from another  room. He slipped his arm around her waist. "They didn't give you a hard time, did they?"


"Nope," Megan shook her head, lips pursed. "But I just heard both Sophia and Natalie are planning to appeal."



Tristan saw the sour look on her face and immediately called Linus Blake. "I heard Sophia and Natalie are trying to appeal. Handle it ASAP."


Ryan twitched at the corner of his mouth. Wasn't this the same woman who sounded like a mafia boss in the other room? Now she's all soft and sweet? What a switch-up.



A second later, Ryan's phone rang. He answered, and his frown went deeper-he looked like someone just force-fed him garbage.



After hanging up, he looked at Tristan and Megan."Natalie's distant relative is coming to bail her out.Says they want a psych evaluation done."



"Distant relative? Who's that supposed to be?"  Ryan gave Megan a hesitant look. "Stella Lewis-matriarch of the Lewis family. Before marrying into the Lewis family, her name was Stella Banks.."



Yikes.



Talk about complicated connections.



That's Jason's mom. If she didn't raise a fuss when her son got stabbed, she probably won't say much now.



Besides, Megan still needed Brandon from their family to treat her grandpa.


If Stella came in full force to pull strings and Megan pushed back too fiercely, what if the old lady flat-out refused to let Brandon help? That'd be a disaster.


Might as well play nice and withdraw the case.


Megan looked at Tristan. "Babe, maybe Natalie really does have some issues going on. Let's just drop the lawsuit,yeah?"



Ryan:[Wasn't she just saying Natalie should rot in jail? That face turn was faster than a TikTok trend.]
###Chapter 98 Prison Or Psych Eval
Tristan totally got what Megan meant. Since she offered him a way out, he took it without hesitation.

He called Linus Blake, told him to drop the lawsuit.

Then he asked Cameron to get in touch with the top psychiatric hospital in the Capital and arrange for their most trusted expert to do a mental assessment for Natalie Banks-on behalf of the Lewis family.

That small move was a huge favor to the Lewis family.

At the same time, it sent a clear message: she might've dodged jail, but there was no way Tristan was letting her off lightly.

That was his bottom line.

Watching the big shots leave, Ryan let out a silent sigh.He figured Natalie would've been better off in prison.

At least serving time had an end date. But once you're in a psychiatric hospital? That's a whole new level of misery. Even if she got out someday, her reputation would already be in the trash.





Capitol City Airport.

Two figures emerged from the VIP security exit.  The man wore a sharp suit, with a tall, imposing figure.His features were striking-deep-set eyes, straight nose, no real emotion on his face, but he gave off that classic mature-man charisma.


His arm was around a petite, stunning socialite. Her fox-like eyes sparkled with calm intensity, like still autumn water.


Oliver, Jason, and Samuel stepped up and respectfully greeted, "Dad, Mom."

Zachary Lewis gave a short nod. "Mm. Your mom's a bit motion-sick. We'll head straight home."

"Honey," Stella rubbed her temple, looking exhausted,"I'm planning to bail out my distant cousin's daughter."

"She stabbed Jason. Forget letting her off, and now you want to go pick her up yourself? You're not in shape for that. Go home and rest."

Zachary's tone made it clear. Stella didn't reply.

If her last name isn't Banks, she wouldn't have bothered in the first place. Especially when her own son was the one who got stabbed.

She finally nodded. "Fine, I'll listen to you. Let Oliver handle it."

Oliver responded with a nod.

"Where's Amelia? Why isn't she here?"

Samuel let out a laugh. "After all the embarrassment she brought to the family, you think she deserves to show up?” Stella sighed. "She might not be your real sister, but she's called you 'brother' all these years. Cut her some slack."


She turned to Jason. "No work today?"

Jason chuckled a little. "Nothing's more important than welcoming you guys home."

Stella smiled at him, her gentle warmth obvious. "My second son always knows just what to say. Samuel,you should learn a thing or two from your brothers."

With a light smile, Zachary wrapped an arm around her slender waist and started walking.

Samuel pouted. "Am I really that out of favor with Mom and Dad?"

Oliver shot him a look but said nothing, following behind.

Jason gave him a friendly pat. "Don't sell yourself short, man."Samuel was a little moved. "Jason, you're really the only one who-"

He didn't even get to finish when Jason let out a laugh."You? No one in the family likes you."

Samuel was speechless. "Seriously? That's what you go with?"

At the airport entrance, Oliver watched the family van drive off, then headed straight to the detention center.


When he got there, Ryan was leaning on the back of a police car, smoking. Two cigarette butts lay on the  ground.

Seeing Oliver approach, Ryan stubbed out his cigarette and came over. "Mr. Lewis."

Oliver nodded slightly. "Thanks for the trouble."

Ryan made a call, and the gate buzzed open. Soon,Natalie was led out.

The moment she saw Oliver, her eyes flickered with disbelief. She knew his mother, Stella, was distantly related to her father, Richard-but they were barely even family.

She'd always tried to cozy up to Amelia, hoping to get closer to the Lewis family, but Amelia kept brushing her off, never letting her get too near.

Now that something had finally happened, she didn't expect the Lewis family would actually step in to bail her out.

She was nervous. After all, she did stab Jason. But this move. could it mean Stella still cared about blood ties?

Her eyes lit up with hope. Maybe this was her way back in-maybe she could even use the Lewises to take down Megan.

But Ryan's next words crushed every bit of that fantasy.

"Mr. Lewis, Mr. Reid said since Natalie needs a psychiatric evaluation, the Reid family will help too.He's arranged the top specialist at the Third Psychiatric Hospital to examine her." When she heard it was Tristan who'd arranged the doctors, Natalie instantly panicked. She'd escaped one trap only to fall into another-worse.

"I'm not going! I'm not going! Once I go in, I'm never getting out!" she screamed, her voice rising in panic.

Ryan looked at her calmly. "Then it's simple. Either you go in for treatment, or you go to prison."

In other words-pretend to be mentally ill or get locked up for real.

Natalie snapped. "It's all that bitch Megan's fault! If it weren't for her, none of this would've happened! My mom wouldn't be disfigured, my dad wouldn't have ended up in the hospital, and the Banks family wouldn't be in ruins. She ruined everything!"

Oliver frowned.


Why did it bother him so much to hear her dragging Megan's name through the mud?

His voice turned cold. "Captain Mitchell,please take her to the hospital. Just keep me posted on the results."

Seeing him get into the car, Natalie completely lost it.Her eyes widened with tears flooding out. "Oliver! You can't just leave me! Your mom is my aunt!"

Oliver rolled the window down and gave her a chilly glance. "Exactly. And that very distant blood tie is the only reason we bailed you out.

If you don't want the psych evaluation, that's fine-go  sit in jail. Up to you.

But don't expect us to ruin our relationship with the Reid family over you."Yeah, those words were tough,but they weren't wronng.

Natalie had sinister intentions-trying to ruin someone's reputation and even going as far as wielding a knife. Just plain brutal.

And her mother? She didn't hesitate to go after someone's looks. In the end, they just got what was coming to them.

Hard to feel sorry for either of them now.

Oliver rolled up the window and shifted his gaze."Let's go."

The driver pulled away.

Natalie stared at the black Rolls-Royce as it disappeared down the road, bawling uncontrollably.

Ryan's tone was sharp: "So, prison or a psych eval?You decide."


After crying herself hoarse, she finally whimpered,"Hospital."

She figured prison meant no way out, but maybe the psych ward would give her a shot to run.

Ryan waved his hand, and two officers moved to escort her into the police car.

Sliding into the front seat, Ryan told the officer next to him, "Third Psychiatric Hospital."  Thirty minutes later, the car pulled up outside the hospital.

Cameron was already waiting at the entrance

After a brief talk with Cameron, the officers brought Natalie inside.


The hospital's top specialist ran a full evaluation and concluded she was suffering from severe dissociative identity disorder and manic episodes-needed inpatient care.


The second Natalie heard the diagnosis, she scratched the expert across the face.

It took four orderlies to hold her still while they gave her a sedative.

The expert, pressing a hand over the scratch marks,gave Cameron a wry smile. "We've seen cases like hers before. Don't worry, we'll make sure she doesn't become a danger to others again."

Ryan stayed quiet. After all, this was the path Natalie had chosen.


Do enough bad, and it'll come back to bite you.

Cameron gave a nod. "Thanks, Dr. Neagle. I'll leave her in your hands."

At the Lewis family villa.

Their car pulled up at the entrance, and Zachary helped Stella down.

Amelia spotted them and hurried over with a bright smile. "Dad, Mom, you're finally back! I missed you so  much!"


She looped her arm through Stella's affectionately

Samuel let out a cold snicker. "What, think your backup's back so you can go back to playing your little games?"

Amelia blinked, teary-eyed. "No wonder you never like me. I really don't know what I keep doing wrong."

Stella patted her hand. "Your brother's never been the type to spoil girls. Don't let it get to you."

Watching the three of them head inside, Samuel turned to Jason. "Did you see that? Classic fake sweetheart act."


Jason shot him a sideways glance. "Wanna know why you keep falling for it?"

"Why?" Samuel genuinely wanted to know.

Jason chuckled. "Because you run your mouth too much."


Samuel:[You sure you're really my brother? Ugh seriously. Not even human.]
###Chapter 99 I've Got Your Real Parents
Lewis Family's old mansion.

Amelia sat on the velvet couch in the living room clinging to Stella' arm with a sweet, careful smile."Mom, the trip must've worn you out, right? Let me give you a quick back rub."

"You've gotten prettier, Amelia," Stella commented.

It sounded kind, but Amelia could feel an invisible distance behind those words.

Stella had never been particularly warm to her, even when she was little-probably because they weren't really related by blood. And ever since it was revealed that Amelia wasn't the biological daughter of the Lewis family, the coldness only got worse.

The Lewis family was still actively searching for her biological parents. That terrified her.

Deep down, she knew her real parents-whoever they were-could never match the wealth, status, or power of the Lewis family. As harsh as it might sound, part of her hoped they were already dead. That way, the Lewises wouldn't have a reason to cut her off.


If they're still alive... then she'd likely be sent back to them.  After living years of privilege, dressing in designer clothes, and being treated like royalty, the thought of losing all that made her panic.

Thankfully, they hadn't found her real parents yet.And the Lewises hadn't breathed a word to the public about the truth either.

So,she was still the Lewis family's elegant heiress-the social butterfly the other rich girls envied and tried to befriend.


She poured tea for Zachary and Stella. "Dad, Mom,please have some tea."

Zachary took a small sip, then said, "I saw the competition. Amelia, switching things behind the scenes like that-it's unacceptable. It reflects badly on this family."

He glanced at her, voice stern. "And your ties to Molly?She's dead now, and the whole thing looks shady.From now on, think before you act."

Stella gently set her cup on the table. "Dear, don't be so harsh. You'll scare her. The matter's done, let's move on."


Then she turned to Amelia. "But Amelia, don't go picking fights with that Shaw girl, She's Mrs. Reid now.The Reids and Lewises get along well-we can't ruin that over something petty."

Amelia looked down quietly, her hands nervously twisting together like a child caught doing something wrong. "I understand, Dad, Mom. I won't make the  same mistake again."

Across from her, Jason and Samuel sat down on the other couch, looking distinctly unimpressed with Amelia's demure act.


They hadn't forgotten how she disguised herself as a nurse to swap Megan's hair sample. And who knew how many underhanded tricks she'd pulled off over the years?

This girl played weak, but her mind ran deep.

Samuel casually bit into a shiny red apple. "Mom,that designer girl? That's Lila Moore. Didn't you say you love her designs? If you want, I'll take you to her-maybe have her draw up something just for you."

Stella's eyes lit up. "She's famous, though! You think you can just walk up and find her?"

Jason chuckled. "He paid her 27 million. Pretty sure she'll take his call."


Stella froze mid-reach. "Twenty-seven million?"

Samuel's face twitched hard. First time he met Megan,she'd used some shady app and hacked his account-turning thirty million into three million before he even blinked.

And Jason just had to bring that mess up again.

Wasn't it enough that he still hadn't caught that damn hacker,Blackwing?

He jabbed a few more aggressive bites into the apple,cheeks stuffed. "I found out she was Lila Moore after  you mentioned liking her stuff, Mom. So I dropped a bit of cash her way. Just wanna see you smile."Stella shot a suspicious look at Samuel. "Since when did our youngest get so smooth? He actually knows how to sweet-talk now?"

"Well, I'm just being a good son and showing some love!"

Jason gave him a firm smack on the back, grinning. "If he were really that good at sweet-talking,he wouldn't still be single."

Samuel choked and started coughing like crazy.He smacked Jason's hand away and glared at him hard.

After finally catching his breath, he muttered, "You're already thirty, and you've got the nerve to tease me?"

Jason chuckled softly, totally unfazed. "So what?Even big bro's still flying solo. No rush."

Zachary's face darkened. "Alright, enough. None of you are making life easier."

He turned toward Stella, the severity in his eyes gone,replaced by tenderness. "Stella, let's go rest upstairs.""Okay."

Amelia got up to help her mother up the stairs, but Zachary gently brushed her hand away. "I've got it."

Jason and Samuel also stood and headed toward the stairs.


Amelia's gaze turned colder as she watched their backs disappear. This was clearly their way of giving Megan a chance to talk to Stella in private.

Seriously? Are they still clinging to hope?

Didn't they already see the paternity test results?

Am I overthinking it?

No way. Everything was flawless. They didn't notice a thing when she swapped the hair samples.

She was just being paranoid.

Then her phone buzzed with a new call.

It was an unknown number. She hit decline without hesitation.


But the caller wouldn't give up and kept calling back.

She hurried upstairs to her room and finally picked up the call.

"Do you ever quit?"

"Does it sting, knowing you're not the real Lewis daughter?"

Amelia covered her mouth, her voice low and shaky."Who are you?"

The man chuckled darkly. "That doesn't matter. What matters is-we're on the same team. If you want to stay in the Lewis family, you better work with me.Or you'll lose everything."

"Why should I believe you?"

"Because I've got your real parents."

That sent a chill down her spine. Eyes wide, lashes trembling, she whispered, "You're lying." "Tsk tsk." The man sneered, "You'll see once I make their identities public. Then you'll know if I'm lying or not."


"No!" Amelia nearly shouted, then quickly softened,"I mean. how can you prove they're my real parents?"

"The butler just came back from shopping. Inside one of the bags is a small envelope. Two strands of hair.Go get them tested-then you'll know I'm telling the truth," his voice was smooth, deliberate. "You can call this number anytime. I'll be waiting."

As the call ended, Amelia collapsed to her knees on the carpet.

Her heart was thudding like crazy.What now?

Why-why is this happening?

He said the envelope was in the grocery bags Mr.Exton brought home. She had to find it, and fast.

She jumped up, flung open the door, and rushed downstairs.

She spotted Mr. Exton, hauling two big shopping bags into the house and heading straight for the kitchen.

Taking a deep breath,she followed him in.

"What'd you get today, Mr. Exton?" she asked with a bright smile.

"Sir and Madam are back, so I bought some fresh fish and meat. Anything in particular you'd like, Miss?"

She nodded. "Could you go ask Mom if she's craving anything? She didn't seem to have much appetite earlier."

Mr.Exton agreed and went off to find Stella.

As soon as the kitchen was empty, Amelia crouched down and started rummaging through the bags.

When she finally found the little envelope, a cold voice cut through the quiet behind her. "What are you doing?"
###Chapter 100 Stella Was Meeting Up wi...
The sudden noise startled Amelia, making her drop the little paper packet in her hand.

She quickly bent down to grab it and shoved it into her sleeve.

Taking a deep breath, she turned around with a small smile. "You're back, Oliver."

Oliver stood with his hands in his pockets, eyes cool and slightly scrutinizing. "What were you doing?"

"I saw Mr. Exton brought back a ton of groceries,"Amelia said, her lips curving. "Since Mom and Dad are home,I figured I'd cook a few dishes for them myself."

Oliver gave a faint nod. "Alright, carry on then." With that,he turned and walked off.

Amelia finally let out the breath she'd been holding.That really almost scared the life out of her.

Her fingers were still trembling a bit.

She rushed back to her room and slipped the paper into her Hermès bag.

Then she changed into a simple sporty outfit, went downstairs, and calmly headed for the kitchen.

Of course, she had zero cooking skills-claiming to cook was just an excuse. In reality, she was just helping out beside the chef,nothing more.

At lunch, Stella was all praises for Amelia's"cooking."Oliver glanced at her. "That was thoughtful of you."

Amelia smiled brightly. "Thanks, Oliver. As long as Mom enjoyed it."

Stella suddenly asked, "Is Natalie's evaluation result out yet?"

Oliver chuckled dryly. "Yeah. Experts at the Third Psychiatric Hospital confirmed that she has serious mental disorders-split personality and mania. Looks like she'll be staying in treatment for the foreseeable future."


Stella wasn't surprised-she knew the Reid famnily wouldn't let this go easily. She was also fully aware of everything Natalie had done.

Her own son got injured because of that woman.

Natalie's mother, Nancy, somehow got her phone number and called in tears, begging her to help get Natalie out of jail. Stella had only agreed not to press charges, not to hand the girl back untouched.

If the Reid family wasn't backing down, there wasn't much she could do.


No point sparking a full-on feud between the Reids and the Lewis family over someone irrelevant.

Samuel set down his chopsticks. "Natalie brought that on herself. I remember you two used to be pretty tight, didn't you?"

Under his gaze, Amelia tightened her grip on her chopsticks. "I stopped hanging out with her once l realized she had issues."

"You didn't pick up on her being mentally unstable?"

Amelia frowned slightly. "I did think she acted... a bit extreme at times. I guess that explains the crazy stunts she pulled."

Samuel gave a snort. "Birds of a feather-just make sure you're more careful next time."

"I got it, Samuel," she said sweetly.

Then Samuel pulled out his phone and dialed."Megan?It's Sam! My mom's a huge fan of yours. Got some time tomorrow? She'd love to swing by for a custom outfit."


"Sam!" Megan , curled up in Tristan's arms munching on fruit, laughed. "Sure, I'm free. Brandon's flight got delayed by the storm anyway. Just come by my studio at school."

"Cool, let's chat more at my place then."

As he hung up, Stella blinked at him, puzzled."Sam?"

He shrugged and pointed at her. "This is the nickname Megan gave me.."

Amelia' heart sank the second she heard Stella was meeting up with Megan.

That woman really did have some resemblance to Stella... What if she turned out to be the real Lewis  daughter?

Trying her best to stay calm, Amelia asked, "When are Grandpa and Grandma coming back?"

Zachary took a sip of water. "Probably next week. The forest's getting chilly-almost time to come back for the fall and winter."


Every year at the start of summer, Mr. and Mrs. Lewis would head out to their lodge in the deep mountains to escape the heat, then return home before winter.

Hearing that, Amelia finally relaxed. As long as Grandma came home,she'd be fine-Grandma always doted on her the most.


-


At Dreamscape Manor.

Megan sat cross-legged, leaning against Tristan's chest, her mouth open, waiting for him to feed her some fruit.


But the shiny silver fork holding a strawberry just hovered there, not moving an inch.

She turned back to look at him and noticed the gloomy look on his face. "What? Did you eat something gross?"

Tristan let out a helpless laugh and popped the strawberry in his own mouth.

Watching her pout from disappointment, he pinched her chin playfully. "You really planning to go visit another guy's place?" Megan finally realized-jeez, this man's jealous again.

She scooted around to wrap her arms around his neck."Huh? What's that sour smell all of a sudden?"

Tristan turned his head to the side, looking all proud and aloof. "Make it up to me."

She noticed the red berry juice still on the corner of his lips and leaned in. Her tongue flicked over it,tasting the sweetness. "So my hubby's lips do taste like strawberries."


Tristan's eyes darkened, and he rolled her onto the bed.

His fingers,cool and gentle,brushed across her cheek."We're good for today."

Megan poked the injury on his side. "Doesn't it hurt?"

"Depends. HHurts when I want you to care. Doesn't hurt when I need to get serious."

She raised a brow. "Wait, what now?"

"When I want pity, it hurts. When duty calls, I'm all good again."

Honestly, Tristan was pretty much everything women dreamed of-just looking at him made your brain short -circuit.


A second of eye contact and it felt like you could get swept away anytimne.

Her teeth sunk into her bottom lip,leaving a soft pink mark, cheeks blushing prettily. "Stop it. Dr. Adams said you need rest,remember?" Tristan buried his lips into her soft neck, his warm breath tickling against her skin, turning it a gentle pink.

Her eyes slid shut on instinct, totally unaware of how alluring she looked.

He hovered close, chuckling softly. "I don't think Mrs.Reid wants me resting at all."

Megan's eyes flew open-so he'd been messing with her this whole time?!

She huffed and pressed her hands to his firm chest."Move,I want more fruit."

Tristan took her hand, kissed her fingertips, then slowly guided it down his body.

Megan nervously swallowed, her lashes trembling ever so slightly.

Right then, she was definitely feeling the pressure.

Tristan's lips trailed from her forehead, to between her brows,along her lashes, and down to her tiny nose.

Finally,his warm mouth found hers, softly stealing the sweetness between her lips.

His fingers, light and daring, slipped under the hem of her silk nightgown.

Everything unfolded so naturally
