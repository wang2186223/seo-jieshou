
###Chapter 1 That Chance Would Never Come
A message lit up Stella Russell's phone,and along with it came a bunch of photos. Clothes scattered carelessly, two people holding each other tightly, messy bedsheets, and a hazy reflection in a fogged-up mirror...



Stella had seen this kind of thing before. This wasn't new to her.



One look at the big hand holding that woman's wrist, and Stella knew it was Marc's. Her husband.The same man she'd been married to for four years.



Then her eyes caught the date on the pictures,and her stomach sank. It was the same day as their wedding anniversary.



Marc had promised they'd spend the evening together, but he'd vanished for three days. All she got was a message from his assistant, saying he had some urgent business to handle.
"Urgent, huh?" Stella let out a cold chuckle.Clearly urgent-in someone else's bed. She then closed the message and called someone from her contact list.



The person picked up almost immediately.



"Stella," came the voice on the other end.



"I've made my decision about the classified research project," she said calmly.



"Who's the candidate?" they asked.



"Me."



A heavy silence stretched on the other end of the line, and then came a sharp,unwavering voice. "Don't joke around, Stella. You know what this means! Once you're in the classified research project, there's no turning back. No outside contact, no personal ties. You'll be officially listed as missing, and everything about your past will be wiped clean. A new identity will be created for you. So ask yourself-are you really ready to walk away from your family?From Marc?"
Stella's eyes fell on the framed wedding photo hanging nearby.



The smiles in it once made her feel warm,but now they just made her heart ache.



Marc's promises, which used to sound sweet,now felt cold and empty.



"I've made my decision," she said quietly. "I'll come by tomorrow to fill out the forms."



She ended the call before the person on the other end could say anything else. She didn't want to hear more. Her mind was already made up.



At that moment, a car pulled up outside.Moments later, Marc Walsh walked in, tall as ever, loosening his black tie while heading straight for the bathroom.



His jacket, tossed lazily on the hook, still carried the suggestive scent of FIRE2, the latest women's perfume of brand Vlexoot. Bold,heated-everything she apparently wasn't anymore.
Marc came out minutes later, dripping from a fast shower, wearing a gray bathrobe.



The robe hung loosely, showing off his chest and abs. Damp hair fell around his face, and the steam only made him look colder. Sharper.



Being the heir to the powerful Walsh family,Marc had everything-looks, status, and money.



Once, she'd been drawn to all of that. Now, it only made her sick.



"What's with that look?" Marc chuckled, sliding an arm around her waist, his voice low and teasing. "Miss me,babe?"



His hand slid down her side, but his touch made her skin crawl. She quickly pulled away.



Marc's hand stopped mid-move, his eyebrows knitting together. "What's going on? Are you mad at me?"



Stella took a breath, steadying herself. She wasn't going to waste energy on another fight.



Pushing down the ache in her heart, she leaned
over and picked up a locked box from the drawer, handing it to him. "Here. A gift."



Inside? The divorce papers she'd already signed.Her final present. "You'll have to guess the password to open it," she said flatly.



Marc gave it a lazy look, thinking it was just another one of her odd little games, and tossed it onto the table. Then he pulled her close again,resting his chin on her shoulder. "You're the only gift I want."


Stella stiffened without meaning to. Marc noticed and gave a low chuckle.



"Still pouting because I missed our anniversary?Work's been nuts," he said while brushing a kiss on her cheek.



Then he let go, pulled a small box from his coat,and handed it to her.



"Do you like it?"


Inside was a hairpin-delicate and gold-plated,clearly custom-made with careful detail.
"I got ths made just for you. You've always liked things like this, haven't you? Try it on."



His voice held that familiar mix of control and affection.



That tone had once been enough to melt her resolve.



People in Choria all believed Marc doted on his wife.



Stella had believed it as well.



If it weren't for the photos saved in her phone,she mnight've really been touched by the gift.



The girl in the pictures was in her twenties,pretty and confident, with flirtatious eyes and long, wavy hair pinned up using the same hairpin that now lay in front of Stella. The loose style revealed her smooth neck-marked with hickeys.



"There's only one like it in the world. You like it,don't you?" Marc gently lifted her hair, his rough fingers brushing against her skin in a way that
was both familiar and far too intimate.



Stella's patience was wearing down fast-she nearly stabbed the damn thing straight into his chest.



She looked up at him, her eyes colder than usual. "The only one in the world, huh?"


Something about her felt off. Marc felt it in his gut. But the moment she smiled, that familiar softness returning, his doubt disappeared.



"If it's truly one of a kind, then yes, I love it."Stella calmly closed the box. "I've got work to do tonight. You go ahead and sleep."



She stepped out of his arms, holding the box tightly, not sparing him a single glance.


A cool draft slipped into his open robe, and for some reason, it left Marc feeling strangely hollow.



Tonight, she seemed colder than usual.



He glanced at the locked box on the table, and a strange calm returned to him.
After all, no one understood Stella's feelings better than he did. She loved him deeply... so deeply that no matter what he did, she'd never truly walk away.



Not now,not ever.



His phone buzzed over and over inside his robe pocket.



When he finally checked it, bold, flirty messages lit up the screen, making his throat tighten.



He gave a short reply, deleted everything,and carelessly tossed the phone aside before sinking into bed.



The soft, familiar scent lingering on the sheets eased his nerves, and before long, he was fast asleep.



Meanwhile, in the study, Stella quietly snapped a picture of the hairpin and sent it to a luxury resale boutique. "Sell this. ASAP."


She attached a bank account. "Send the money
here."



It was the institute's official account.



Even something stained could still be put to good use.







By morning, when Marc opened his eyes, Stella was already fully dressed.


He leaned up on his elbows and motioned her over.



His voice was husky and soft with sleep. "Come here. Give me a hug."



Stella's fingers paused on her blouse buttons.She drew in a breath, her gaze clear and composed."Something urgent came up at the institute. I've got to leave now. Didn't have time to make breakfast-you'll have to sort it out yourself today."


She grabbed her bag and walked out, just like last night-no glance, no hesitation.
Marc's hands froze mid-motion, a hollow feeling creeping back into his chest. He slowly rubbed his brows, trying to shake it off.



No matter how packed her schedule was, Stella never missed a morning. She always made sure breakfast was ready just in time. Then she'd gently wake him, coax a hug, and offer a morning kiss with that sweet smile.



But not today.



"Stella."



Just as she opened the door, she heard his voice behind her. It felt like something ripped through her chest-sharp and deep.



She turned slowly, her eyes steady. "Yes?"



Marc looked at her for a long moment. She seemed normal. Maybe it was just in his head."Make sure you eat, even if things get hectic.And don't stay up too late. The Marina Horizon deal hit a snag, so I'll be working late this week.Don't wait up."
"Alright." Stella smiled.


With sunlight on her face, that warm smile and sparkling eyes reminded him of the girl who'd once taken his breath away.


Marc's heart skipped a beat. His voice turned even softer. "Once work calms down, let's go to Midstream Isle. Make up for the honeymoon we missed."



Her heart, already aching, felt like it was breaking all over again.


Back when they were planning the wedding,she'd carefully listed out places they'd travel to together-one for every anniversary as another honeymoon. She'd believed they'd stay in love forever.



But this year, Marc had taken another woman to that very place. The photos of them together were still in her phone.



Stella lowered her eyes and answered quietly,"Sure... when things settle down."
With that, she turned and walked out.





Not a flicker of warmth was left in her eyes.




And sadly for him, that chance would never come.
###Chapter 2 Caught Red Handed



Stella drove her modest black Volkswagen straight through the gates of the Hookwood Research Institute.



The moment she stepped inside the main office building, Lainey Lewis, her senior colleague,marched up and grabbed her by the wrist."You're seriously here to submit the application?What's going on, Stella? You didn't reply to my messages. You can't just make a decision like this on a whim. This project isn't some experiment, and you should've at least discussed it with Marc."



A sharp ache rose in Stella's chest, but she remained silent.



Instead,she unlocked her phone, scrolled to a WhatsApp conversation, and handed it over.



Dozens of provocative messagesand suggestive images stared back-sent more than
once. One photo in particular left nothing to the imagination.



Lainey glanced at the screen, then immediately shoved the phone back into Stella's hands, her eyes blazing. "That bastard! If it weren't for your patents back then, his company wouldn't have even made it past launch. And now he's cheating on you? Come on, we're going back. I swear I'll make him crawl on his knees begging for mercy."



Stella quickly caught her arm. "No. That won't be necessary."



"What do you mean, not necessary? After what he's done? You're just going to stand there and let him get away with it?"



Her voice was shaking, but Stella's was cool and even.



"Let him off? Never." She slid her phone back into her coat pocket. "Facing him head-on would be far too easy. I want him to suffer... to truly regret everything."



Lainey said nothing more. She knew exactly the
kind of person Stella was.



Brilliant in the lab. Honest to a fault. But if someone pushed her beyond her limits, she'd never let it go quietly. She'd bounce back when they least expected it-with precision and force.



They walked together toward the administrative office,and the form submission went smoothly.A few steps, a couple of stamps, and everything was nearly finalized-just awaiting the final review.



Before she left, Stella volunteered to attend an academic seminar on behalf of the institute and gather the necessary materials.


By 3:30 p.m., the event at the Grace Hotel had wrapped up. Holding a folder against her chest,Stella stepped out of the lobby, making her way toward the parking lot when a familiar, lazy chuckle reached her ears.



"Come on now, be good."



Her body stiffened at once. The moment she heard that voice, she slowly turned around. A wave of betrayal crashed over her, as if the
ground beneath her had shifted without warning.



Marc had his arm wrapped around a long-haired woman with a slim waist, guiding her through the entrance of the hotel. The woman chirped,"I miss you... miss you so much," her voice syrupy and intimate.



As she said it, she leaned into Marc, her lips trailing from his earlobe down his neck, her red lipstick smudging along his skin.



Marc laughed, low and fond, drawing her even closer, his palm firmly resting at the curve of her waist.



Stella's vision blurred for a second,her chest tightening.



So this was where the woman had followed him -to this very hotel-and they couldn't even wait until nightfall.



Then,through the slowly spinning glass of the revolving door, their eyes met.


Marc's gaze was dark and full of desire, wvhile Stella's eyes were calm and distant, with a hint
of mockery.


The air between them suddenly felt heavy.


The woman noticed Stella too. But instead of looking startled, she simply smiled smugly, then turned and kissed Marc again-this time deeper,more deliberate, as if marking her territory.


A bitter taste rose in Stella's throat. Her stomach churned wvith nausea. She turned away,refusing to witness the spectacle any longer.


She reached for her car door, but before she could get into the car, a hand stopped her from behind. Marc had chased after her, a little breathless, and the smell of that woman's bold perfume still clung to him-strong enough to make her sick.



"Let go!" Stella tried to shake him off, but the door wouldn't budge.



Marc didn't say a word-he just grabbed her waist and pushed her into the back seat, sliding in right after. His sharp features looked tense,and his eyes flickered with a strange mix of anxiety and impatience. "Stella, please, let me
explain."


With nowhere to run, Stella shifted away and spoke in a frozen tone. "Wipe that lipstick off your mouth before you start talking."


Marc's face fell. His hand flew to his mouth without thinking, eyes flashing with a hint of panic. "The Marina Horizon deal's in trouble. I've been stressing over the funding and reached out to Nova Holdings. Haley Smith-she's the daughter of a board member of Nova Holdings.She doesn't speak our language well and had been drinking. I was just making sure she got back to the hotel."



His tone was gentle, and he leaned in the way he always did when he wanted to charm her."She's from Achury. People in her country are pretty relaxed, you know that. I swear I'll be more careful. Don't be upset, okay? I'll make it up to you."



Stella looked at him, her eyes sharp and cold."So... is that how you secure investments? By getting that close to their daughters?"



There was no shouting, no tears.
Stella spoke with a chilling calm, too composed to be angry. Her quiet words stripped every excuse from Marc's mouth, leaving them meaningless.



That same heavy emptiness crashed into him again. Frustrated, he pulled at his tie,trying to breathe."Stella, come on. It's for work. Can you not blow this out of proportion?"



Stella almost laughed.



She hadn't even raised her voice.



Did he want her to throw the photos in his face to make it count as drama?



The love she'd held onto all these years now burned like a blade in her chest.



"If you're done with me, Marc,just be honest.I won't hold on-I'll give you the divorce you want."



Why did he have to play games? Why lie?



Right after those words left her mouth,Marc grabbed her shoulder-hard.
His eyes were ice. "Don't ever say that. We promised-no matter what, we'd work through it. Divorce is not an option. Don't even mention it."



Work it out?



He had already slept with someone else. What was left to fix now?



It felt like she was trapped in a web of thorns.Every breath, every movement cut deeper.


Suddenly, Marc's phone rang. He checked it,frowned, and declined the call.


But Stella caught the name on the screen."Sweetheart Wild Thing."



Before he could tuck it away, the phone lit up again-this time, WhatsApp messages popping up. The sender's name? "Sizzling Baby."



"Baby, I'm in pain."



"I need you. Come now."



"I'm bleeding... am I going to die?"
Three texts, all in Achure, one after another.
###Chapter 3 Just A Friend



It was like Marc believed she couldn't read Achure at all-he didn't bother hiding the screen and typed a swift "On my way" before shutting off his phone without a word of hesitation.



"Stella, I've got something urgent to handle. If you can't help, at least stay out of the way. Be good, alright?" He said softly, brushing her hair as if she were a child.



Then he turned and walked away without once looking back. She just sat there and let him go.



It felt like something inside her had been torn to pieces-too much pain to feel anything at all.


She dropped the conference materials off at the institute for recordkeeping, then quietly headed home without another word.



Marc didn't return for the next three days, and she didn't call.



Not even once. There was nothing left to say.
While waiting for her final approval, she kept herself occupied by sorting through her things -anything to keep her mind from collapsing.



The storage room was a shrine to their years together-handwritten notes from their first confession, the lopsided pottery they made on their first date, a small heart-shaped stone from a mountain night sky, and rows of framed photos bundled by year. Even the Polaroid cameras were neatly arranged from oldest to newest.



Stella had always been sentimental-she kept these things, hoping one day they'd sit together as old souls, laughing over the past.



But now, it all felt like some cruel joke. Without hesitation, she tossed the keepsakes into the fireplace and watched them burn.



As for the expensive gifts-diamonds, luxury watches, delicate necklaces, and even the wedding ring-she lined them up, took photos,and messaged her contact at the resale boutique. She told him to clear them all out.
When she saw the empty jewelry box, it finally sank in-love, no matter how glittering, was worthless once tainted by betrayal.


After another two days, she got the news that her application for joining the closed-door research project had been approved.



She had ten quiet days before the project would begin.



Wanting to stock up on essentials, she changed clothes and headed to the mall. But as she came down the escalator with her shopping bags, she caught sight of a scene that stopped her in her tracks.



There stood Jazlyn Walsh-her always-critical mother-in-law-smiling warmly and clinging to that Haley woman's arm like they were old friends. The affection on her face was a stab to the gut.



And next to them was Marc, the same man who'd disappeared for days, carefully slipping a glittering diamond bracelet onto Haley's wrist with all the tenderness he used to reserve for
her.



They looked complete-like a picture-perfect family.One that didn't include her.


When Haley nodded with delight, Jazlyn praised her taste with a sparkle in her eye and casually handed over a black card for payment.



But to Stella, the moment was soaked in bitter irony.


That black card belonged to her. It was her money being spent.


She had earned those privileges... deep discounts, first picks from new collections, all because of her close friendship with the brand's director.



What was meant as a thoughtful gesture to bring her and Jazlyn closer was now being used to flatter Marc's mistress.



Without hesitation, Stella marched up to the counter, yanked the card from the stunned saleswoman's hand, and said calmly, "Sorry. This card's no longer valid."
The employee blinked in confusion. "Ma'am,that's a premium card. It doesn't expire,and it can't be canceled..."



"Oh, really?" Stella broke the card clean in half and tossed it into the nearby trash without blinking. "It's canceled now."



Jazlyn's fury exploded. She slapped Stella hard across the cheek and hissed, "What's gotten into you? Do you even realize how disgraceful you're being?"



The Walsh family carried a spotless reputation,and Marc had always been praised as a prodigy in finance.



From the very beginning, when Stella and Marc had only just started dating, Jazlyn had treated her with indifference. And after the wedding,that coldness only grew. No matter how hard Stella tried to earn her approval, a warm smile never came.



She had always kept quiet, not wanting to put Marc in a tough spot.
But that patience-built on love-had finally run dry.



She had no reason to tolerate it anymore.



Then,suddenly,two crisp slaps rang out,landing squarely on Marc's face.


The noise silenced everyone around them.


This was Marc Walsh-the man hailed in financial circles like a legend, and now he stood,red-cheeked, slapped in broad daylight.


"Stella!" Jazlyn shouted, livid. She rolled up her sleeves as if ready to storm forward and retaliate.


However, Stella stood her ground, her chin lifted high. "You lay a hand on me again,and I'll hit him twice as hard. Want to test me?"


"You! You..." Jazlyn was so furious she clutched her chest for breath. "Marc! Look at her! How can you let her act like such a shrew?"


Stella turned toward Marc with a cold smirk."Tell me,Marc-didn't I have every reason to
slap you?"



Marc's expression hardened, his jaw clenched.He stepped forward and seized her wrist,muttering under his breath, "Stella, that's enough. Just calm down. You're making a scene."



Suddenly, Haley rushed into Marc's arms,dragging his hand to her waist and whining in Achure about Stella's outrageous behavior.



She clung to him like ivy, calling him "darling"again and again, asif she wanted to dissolve into his skin.



Marc murmured soft reassurances in Achure,speaking to her gently.


The sight of them, so close and cozy, made Stella laugh in disbelief.


Then,out of nowhere,Stella spoke-her Achure fluent,her tone sharp.



"If you're bold enough to be someone's mistress, at least have the decency not to play the innocent. You're sleeping with another woman's husband-don't even think about
denying it. If Achure's not working for you, we can switch. I speak sixteen languages. You pick one, and I'll keep up. If I lose the argument, I'll admit defeat."



Haley's face turned a deep red.


She had clearly never imagined Stella could speak Achure so perfectly. Hadn't Marc said his wife was just some regular office employee?


Marc's face darkened, his tone rigid. "Stella...when did you learn Achure?"


The moment hit her like a knife twisting deeper into an open wound.


Her lips curled into a bitter smile.


"Ah, Marc, you must really love me, huh?" The sarcasm in her voice was razor-sharp. "Go on,enjoy your little shopping spree. I won't get in your way."


And with that, she turned on her heel and walked away.



Marc quickly moved to follow, but Jazlyn and
Haley each latched onto one of his arms,stopping him.


"Marc, just divorce that shameless woman already! How dare she lay a hand on you?"Jazlyn snapped.


She had said those exact words countless times before, and Marc had always ignored them.But for some reason, this timne, they felt different.They got under his skin.


"That's between me and her," he muttered,shaking them off and hurrying after Stella.



Luckily, he managed to catch her just as she reached her car. "Stella."


The second his fingers touched her wrist, a wave of nausea hit her, and she shook it off in disgust. "What is it, Mr. Walsh? Done playing house with your wild little darling?"



Marc's face twisted in frustration. "Haley's just a friend. Why are you being so jealous? Can't you be mature for once? Do you have to humiliate us in public?"
Stella let out a dry, disbelieving laugh.


Of course. Somehow, in the end, it always circled back to being her fault. How convenient.


"So let me get this straight," she snapped."Even if I walk in on you and your side piece in bed, I should smile, close the curtains, and stand outside to protect the family name?"


His grip on her wrist tightened, his eyes flashing."How many times do I have to say it? She's just a friend!"



"A friend, is it?" Stella's tone dripped with irony as she looked him up and down.



Then her gaze turned playful, laced with something sharper like seduction or maybe vengeance.



"Alright then, I'll go find myself a friend too.And I'll make sure to do everything you and Haley have done-every last thing." She leaned in slightly, her voice a whisper dipped in venom."And you, dear husband... don't get jealous.That wouldn't be fair, now would it?"
###Chapter 4 Wanna Be My
One-Night Stand



Stella's final words hit harder than any slap. The way she called him "husband" carried weight.It wasn't just to remind him of their relationship but more like a warning. As if she really might walk out and find someone else... just like that.



Marc's hand clamped tighter around her wrist,his voice low and livid. "Don't you dare."



His grip was so tight it felt like he might snap a bone.



But that was nothing compared to the ache in her chest. Stella felt as if something had pierced right through her heart, each heartbeat twisting the knife deeper.



She met his eyes, pain and disbelief swimming in hers. "So you do know you've gone too far,"she whispered.



Marc froze for a second, then shoved her away
like her words had burned him. "I told you,Haley and I didn't cross any line. But if you want to go and get yourself a male companion-do what you want."



Her wrist throbbed, the ache spreading through her arm. But it was her heart that hurt more.



She gave him a slow, mocking smile. "You said it. So when it happens, don't you dare play the victim."



Without another glance, she turned,got into the car, and slammed the door. Marc ran after her,banging on the window. "Stella!" But before he could pull the door open, Jazlyn and Haley caught up, each grabbing an arm to hold him back.



The moment passed, and Stella didn't wait around. She stepped on the gas and left them behind in a roar of tires.



The bar was drenched in neon lights and thick smoke, packed with people trying to escape their loneliness.



Stella sat slouched in a booth tucked in the
corner, already tipsy from drinking too much.



She had seen the betrayal with her own eyes.Now,every bitter truth crashed into her, cutting through her like blades, mixed with memories that used to be beautiful.



"Excuse me." A deep, smooth voice pulled her out of her thoughts, and her mind returned to the present in an instant.



She blinked, lifting her head. There he was-tall and composed, his legs long and poised in tailored black trousers.



His jacket was open, revealing a crisp black shirt tucked neatly into his belt, highlighting a slim,well-toned waist. His frame was strong, his chest broad. A sharp jawline, well-shaped lips,and eyes thatseemed to see right through her.



He was dangerously attractive.



Without a second thought,she pulled him down onto the sofa, climbed onto his lap, and played with his tie, her breath warm and sweet.



"Wanna be my one-night stand?" she whispered
boldly.



Her fingers lightly brushed his chest. Her eyes sparkled, playful and seductive. "Trust me, we'd enjoy ourselves."



She sat up and swayed slightly, tempting like a flame dancing in the dark, teasing him.



She could feel herself losing control,letting her pain take over. But the man just stared at her with an unreadable expression, not even slightly tempted. It made her feel ridiculous, like she was performing alone on a stage.



Whatever heat had been building inside her vanished in a second.



What if he was already with someone? Was she really about to become another Haley?



The thought made her sick.



A bitter smile curved her lips. She let her head rest lightly against his chest, trying to pull herself together.



Because of Marc, she had nearly turned into the
very kind of woman she couldn't stand.



"Sorry... I drank too much," she murmured,retreating into her seat. She curled up in the corner and finished another glass in a single gulp. She didn't move until the man stood and walked away. Only then did she get up unsteadily and vanish into the night.



That night, Marc didn't come home.



As for Stella, she embraced the quiet and the peace it brought.



The following morning, she went straight to the research center.



Even though her participation was already approved, she still needed to complete some paperwork.



Lainey, who was sorting project files nearby,suddenly looked up with a cheeky grin on her face.



"Hey Stella, did you hear? This project's got serious attention from the higher-ups. There's a VIP joining us-super rich, comes from a
powerful family, and still single. Aren't you even a little curious?"



"Why would I be?" Stella replied flatly,still looking at her research notes, not the least bit interested.



The Hookwood Research Institute had a strong reputation, and she'd seen plenty of wealthy heirs come around just to boost their image.



"But this guy's on another level," Lainey said,leaning over Stella's desk. "Come on, with your looks and charm? You could have any man eating out of the palm of your hand. Once the research kicks off, your records vanish, your marriage to Marc wiped clean like it never happened. Just picture it-walking in with someone powerful and drop-dead gorgeous,letting Marc see exactly what he lost. Tell me that wouldn't feel amazing."



Stella finally looked up. Her eyes were clear but cold. "That's petty. Marc will lose much more than that."



Just then, there was a knock at the door.
It was an administrative coordinator,letting them know it was time to head to the meeting room and meet the rest of the project team.



"Do you think the VIP's here already?" Lainey said excitedly, grabbing Stella and rushing toward the meeting room.


"Wait, I haven't even packed my stuff," Stella said, holding her folder close as she tried to keep up. When they got there, she quietly took a seat in a corner and focused on her files.



She didn't look up until a round of applause echoed through the room. Then, slowly lifting her head, she locked eyes with a man whose gaze was intense and powerful.


Her heart gave a sudden jolt. She glanced down and saw the same soft lips she remembered from the night before-lips that looked far too tempting.



How could it be him?
###Chapter 5 Leaving Her Nowhere To Hide



Just the memory of what she'd done at the bar made Stella drop her head in a hurry. She could almost feel the man's intense gaze burning into her,leaving her flustered and uncomfortable.



"He's ridiculously good-looking,right?" Lainey nudged her with a grin. "What's going on with you? You're blushing like crazy. Did you fall for him already? And to think, you were the one saying you weren't interested just a minute ago!"



Stella's cheeks burned from the teasing, and her ears felt hot. "Cut it out," she muttered.



"Good morning, everyone. I'm William Briggs.It's an honor to join this project, and I look forward to working with all of you to see it through," the man said in a deep,smooth voice that drew another round of applause.



Stella was caught off guard, her embarrassment fading as she looked up again.
William Briggs?


Could it really be that William Briggs-the genius who co-founded the institute and had joined a top-tier lab at just fifteen?



Her surprised gaze met his calm, unreadable eyes. William sat down casually, his sharp fingers tapping lightly on the table. "Mr. Gibson,you may start," he said coolly.


Although the meeting was supposed to be just an introduction, everyone was expected to present their thoughts on how the project could be developed further.



They began on the left side of the room, and each person shared their ideas in turn.



Stella pushed aside her earlier emotions and forced herself to concentrate.



Being the youngest on the team, Stella's ideas stood out for their creativity. After her ten-minute presentation, the room responded with applause.
William's gaze briefly flickered with approval.


Mr.Gibson,seated next to William, leaned over and said softly, "All those patent projects you've been following? Stella either led or helped develop them. She's extremely gifted.Originally, she wasn't going to take part in this project due to family issues, but she submitted her application at the last minute. I think she's going to surprise us."



The meeting continued for more than an hour.


Just as the meeting wrapped up, Stella felt a sharp cramp in her lower belly, followed by a warm,unwelcome gush she couldn't control.


She knew immediately what had happened.Frozen in place by embarrassment,she waited until the room emptied out before rushing to the restroom across the hall.


And just as she feared, there was a visible bloodstain on her white trousers.



Her periods were never regular, and after everything she'd been through emotionally,this
one had come in strong.


In her rush to the meeting room earlier, she hadn't even grabbed her phone-so now, she couldn't call anyone for help.


Letting out a frustrated sigh, she blew gently at her bangs, then gathered herself and stepped out, hoping she could slip into the underground parking lot unnoticed.


But the moment she looked up, she froze.William was at the sink, calmly washing his hands. 2



Caught off guard, Stella pressed herself against the wall. Her face flushed with heat.


She couldn't go forward, and turning back wasn't an option either.



The situation was awkward enough,and now it was ten times worse. She wished the floor would just open up and swallow her whole.


Meanwhile, William dried his long fingers slowly with a paper towel. Then he glanced at her and said in a calm, low voice, "How long are you
planning to stand there, Ms. Russell?"



Stella forced a tight smile and mumbled,"You go ahead."



His eyes flicked down to the blue folder she was using to hide her back. He paused for a moment, then casually took off his suit jacket and handed it to her. "Would this help?"



She was stunned. Her face flushed even deeper.



Did he... notice? Did he see the stain?



The embarrassment was overwhelming,but there was no time to overthink it. She quickly accepted the jacket and put it on.


Thanks to the nearly eight-inch height difference between them, the jacket hung down just right, covering everything she wanted to hide.



It was still warm from his body and carried that cool, clean scent unique to him-reminding her of what happened last night at the bar.


She gave a stiff smile. "Thank you, Mr. Briggs.
And sorry... this is kind of embarrassing."



William stared at her face, still a little pink. Her eyes were clearly flustered, though she was trying her best to act calm. Then, without warning,he stepped closer.



His tall frame and quiet authority made the air around them feel heavy. The pressure was almost too much, and Stela felt completely surrounded.



"Last night," he said slowly, his voice low and unhurried. "When you were pulling on my tie and inviting me to your bed, you didn't seem this shy."



Ah-there it was.



Stella's heart skipped a beat. Her mind went blank, and she instinctively took a few steps back,rattled.



Why was he being so blunt? So shamelessly direct? He didn't even try to ease into it-just hit her with the truth, leaving her nowhere to hide.
###Chapter 6 Did He Kiss You



Caught between irritation and embarrassment,Stella shot him a look, her flushed face only making her more striking. "Mr. Briggs, I already apologized forit last night."



William's throat moved as he swallowed,almost involuntarily.



The memory of her on his lap-moving the way she did-flashed vividly through his mind. His fingers twitched slightly by his side, rubbing together as if recalling the sensation.



"Still out clubbing at a time like this, Ms. Russell?You really ought to start taking better care of yourself." Without waiting for a reply, he turned on his heel and walked off.



Stella stood frozen, mortified and seething.Watching him walk away so casually made her want to lash out, but all she could do was tighten her grip on the coat and storm back to her office.
Thankfully, Lainey had been pulled into a meeting with Mr. Gibson and wasn't around.Without wasting another second, Stella grabbed her phone and bag and hurried out of the institute.



She found a mall nearby, bought a set of casual clothes, and finally got out of her ruined pants.



It wasn't until she'd changed and calmed down a bit that she noticed-William's coat had blood on it too.



Even if it hadn't been stained, she knew she couldn't clean and return it properly. There was no question-she'd just replace it with a new one.



She checked the label for the brand and drove straight to the flagship store in the city.



But the moment she parked, her phone lit up-it was Marc calling.



She rejected the call, but he kept calling again and again. It was clear he wasn't planning to
stop until she picked up.


Not wanting to be dragged into another pointless argument, Stella blocked his number without hesitation.



Inside the store, she asked one of the staff about the coat and was told that it was custom -made. There weren't any off-the-rack versions.



She had no idea what his exact measurements were, and a custom piece would take at least two weeks-time she didn't have.



"Please find me something close in style and price," she said.



Once she got the replacement, she headed home,thinking Marc was probably still off with Haley. But the moment she stepped into the living room, she froze. There he was--sitting on the couch, looking stormy and tense. His black shirt was half undone, exposing the sharp line of his collarbone, and the moment his eyes landed on her, that cold, piercing stare weighed down on her like a storm ready to break.
"Why weren't you answering my calls?"


His blaming tone actually made her laugh.



"Weren't you off charming the heiress for investment deals? I wouldn't dare interrupt such an important moment."



"When did you start talking like this?" Marc snapped, clearly annoyed, as he got up and moved toward her-maybe to calm her down.But then his eyes landed on the coat she was carrying. It was obviously a man's-oversized and not hers.



The fury in Marc's eyes flared up without warning. "Who does that coat belong to?"



When she got back earlier, Stella had noticed that the shopping bag was far too big and flashy-bringing it to the institute would only raise unnecessary questions. So, she tossed it.



But now, she stood there holding the coat plainly in her arms.



She didn't feel like explaining.
"Why does it matter to you whose coat this is?You've got your woman-so I can have my man.Everything you did with Haley, I'm allowed to do too,right? Isn't that fair?"



"Stella!" The mere idea of her in another man's arms sent rage boiling through him. His hand shot out, gripping her wrist tightly, his knuckles pale, and veins straining across his forehead."I don't care how angry or hurt you are! Don't you dare say that to provoke me."



Having known him for nearly a decade, Stella had come to believe she knew him better than anyone.



And in this moment, through his fury and jealousy, she could clearly feel it-his love for her.



But that so-called love felt twisted and filthy-something that made her sick to her stomach.


"I'm not joking," she said coldly. "Whatever you did with Haley, I've done with someone else too."


Her wrist throbbed in pain as Marc's grip
tightened like he meant to crush the bones.



She winced from the pain but didn't pull away.



Her heart had already been crushed-there was nothing left to protect. So why should Marc and Haley get to move on as if nothing happened?



Just a few sharp words, and he was already losing control?



Had he ever once stopped to think what it felt like for her to find out about him and Haley?



Marc locked eyes with her, desperate to find a crack in her words, something to prove she was lying.



But he found nothing.



Her gaze was so unnervingly calm that it rattled him to the core.



"You can't do this to me, Stella," he muttered,before completely losing control and yanking her onto the sofa, pressing her down beneath him.
His kisses burned against her neck, but the scent of someone else's perfume clung to him,and it wasn't hers.



Stella felt as if something slimy and cold was wrapping around her, making her skin crawl.


Marc seemed to have lost control. His movements were harsh and forceful.


Infuriated by her resistance,he gripped her chin and bit her lips roughly. "Did that man kiss you?Touch you? Stella, you're mine. If you ever let someone else put a hand on you,I swear,I'll make you regret it."



The sharp clink of a belt buckle being unfastened rang in her ears like a siren.
###Chapter 7 Ultra-thin Condoms



Stella had had enough. In one swift motion, she brought her knee up sharply, landing a brutal blow between Marc's legs.



Marc let out a low, pained groan as his body gave out, folding onto the carpet. He clung to her with one trembling hand, refusing to let go.His breath came in sharp, uneven bursts, and beads of cold sweat slid down the sides of his face,soaking into his hairline.



Stella yanked a tissue from her bag and scrubbed her lips with disgust. Her gaze burned down at him. "Didn't you say nothing happened with your precious friend? Then why are you acting guilty? What exactly are you so afraid of?"



The veins on his forehead pulsed like they might burst, and for a second, it looked like he might lose control completely.


But then, the coat she had been holding slipped
from her grasp, landing in front of him with the tag still dangling-brand new, untouched.



Marc froze. Then, to her surprise, a dark laugh rolled from his throat. He got up slowly and slid his arms around her waist like she was already his again.



"Stella, this is all an act to make me jealous,right? You bought a new coat and pretended it was some other man's. Iknow you too well-you can't stay mad at me for long."



He buried his face against her waist, nuzzling her like a child seeking forgiveness, his domineering edge melting into tender pleading."Don't pull something like this again, okay?You're everything to me. If I lost you, l'd lose my mind."



His voice trembled with emotion-obsessive,desperate, and, for a brief moment, it stirred something deep in Stella's heart.



During the first two years they were together,all they had ever shared were gentle kisses and warm,lingering hugs.
Whenever things grew intense, Marc would simply hold her like this-pressing close,murmuring in a raspy voice how he couldn't survive without her.



Back then, Stella had truly believed that what they had would never break. That it was real.Unshakable.



After a long stretch of silence with no reply from her, Marc finally lifted his gaze. His eyes,faintly reddened,held a touch of quiet hurt.


"Stella... please don't stay mad at me, alright?There's nothing between me and her. My heart,my body-it's always been yours. Only yours."


He gently took her hand and placed it over his chest, looking at her with heartfelt intensity."I made a promise. I'd never break that. Never."



Stella didn't withdraw her hand. Her fingers rested over his chest, where his heartbeat pounded steadily beneath her palm.



Her voice, however, was ice-cold. "Do you remember the consequences of breaking that
vow?"



The moment she said it, the chest beneath her hand tensed instantly.



She watched panic flicker in his eyes as she recited it slowly, word for word.



"If you break this vow, Marc... may you be cursed with infertility, die a painful and untimely death,lose everything and everyone you love,and be left in ruin and despair."



Marc couldn't hold her gaze anymore. He turned away, sat up beside her, and muttered while holding her hand, "If it means you'll stop being angry, I'll agree to whatever you say."



And just like that, Stella felt a bitter emptiness settle in. What was the point of all this?



A man who could lie without blinking wasn't going to be shaken by a curse, not even one that damned his soul.


She calmly pulled her hand away. "You've been busy lately-I get it. I believe you. No more fights. Didn't you say something about
Midstream Isle? Let's go next weekend."



Marc exhaled in visible relief, drawing her into his embrace and pressing a kiss to the crown of her head. "Next weekend, then. I'll plan everything."



With her soft figure in his arms and that familiar scent clouding his senses, he knew this was only a temporary peace. He had to find a way to make her truly his again.



Stella buried her revulsion deep down, her eyes turning to frost.


Next weekend, Marc would finally receive the "surprise" she'd been preparing for him.



Night had fallen, and the sky was heavy with dark clouds, hinting at an approaching storm.



Marc walked out of the bathroom, a towel loosely tied around his waist, steam still clinging to his skin. His toned body was fully on display.



He climbed into bed and leaned in close, resting against Stella's neck. Glancing at the book she was holding, he murmured, "Stella,a friend of
mine brought back a box of ultra-thin condoms from Raskait. Want to give them a try tonight?"
###Chapter 8 He Hadn't Noticed Anything Amiss



Marc's voice was gentle, almost teasing, and the ends of his damp hair brushed lightly against Stella's cheek. But instead of stirring any warmth in her heart, the touch made her skin prickle with unease.



After discovering the affair with Haley, Stella had drawn a line. Whenever Marc reached for her,she always had a reason-any reason-not to let him near.



His hands wandered aimlessly, never crossing the boundary she hadn't allowed. He was careful not to touch the places that would really make her react.



He was holding back-waiting for her to say yes.



There was a time when that kind of restraint meant everything to her. It had felt like love-that no matter how much he wanted her, he would never push her beyond her will.
She used to believe it was his way of loving her.But now she understood-when he didn't get what he wanted, he simply turned to someone else.



That was his idea of love. What a joke.



"Stella, don't be like this. You know you're the only one I care about," he whispered, the words sliding off his lips with the ease of someone who'd said them a hundred times before.



The taste of bile crept up her throat, but she kept it down. Gently placing a hand on his chest,she sad, "Let me freshen up first, okay?"



Her response caught him off guard. His eyes lit up, hopeful. He leaned in, brushed a kiss by the edge of her lips, and murmured, "No need.I don't mind."



Inside, she laughed bitterly. She knew this game well. If she pushed him away now, he'd only get more insistent.



With a soft, almost sweet smile, she whispered,"I want tonight to feel special, something to
remember. I won't take long."


The fake tenderness in her eyes was all he needed. It puffed up his pride.


To him, all her anger was just an emotional phase-nothing serious. She still loved him.He was sure of it.



In the bathroom, she stared at her reflection-cold, composed, emotionless. None of the softness she'd just shown remained.



She'd made sure to bring her phone. Turning on the rear camera, she snapped a mirror shot.


The kiss he left on her neck had stained her skin like a bruise-faint but noticeable in the picture.



She perched on the toilet seat and calmly sent the photo, along with the earlier bed shots to Haley. Then she sat still and began to count.


Sure enough, just a few seconds later, Marc's phone lit up with a call from outside the bathroom.



Stella twisted the faucet open, letting the sound
of rushing water drown out any voices coming from the bedroom. A few minutes passed before Marc's knock sounded lightly against the bathroom door.



"Stella, something urgent came up at the office.I've got to go. Don't wait up-just get some rest after your shower."



A faint smile tugged at her lips, laced with irony and quiet disbelief. So eager to leave, huh? She hadn't even stepped out of the bathroom,and he was already halfway out the door.



She stood still, listening as the bedroom door clicked shut. Then, with a steady breath, she opened the bathroom door and looked around.The room was quiet and empty. Her heart sank a little more at the sight.



She had planned this from the start-sending those photos to Haley, knowing full well that Haley's jealousy would spark an immediate reaction. And it had worked. Like clockwork.



Yet, deep inside, a tiny voice-faint and foolish -had hoped Marc would hesitate. That he might stay. That he'd choose her, just once.
But once again,reality proved crueler than hope.Marc, who swore he loved her, had dropped everything and run to Haley without a second thought.



Was it really possible to share love like that-half for a wife, half for another woman?



Stella had already packed the things she cared about. Her suitcase sat quietly in the corner of the room, waiting.



If Marc had really meant all those words,he would've seen that most of her things were already gone from the bedroom.


But he didn't. He noticed nothing,too sure of himself, thinking she would never actually walk away.


The only thing left in that room that still connected them was the wedding photo on the wall.


She looked at their smiling faces in that picture,and her eyes filled with tears she hadn't let fall.
It only took a few short years for their shared dreams to fall apart and turn into two separate lives.



She once thought marrying Marc was the best thing that ever happened to her. Now she knew how badly she was mistaken.


Stella took the photo out of its frame and quietly walked to the backyard.


There, she found an old metal basin, tucked near the shed. She placed the photo inside,doused it in gasoline, and lit a match.


The flames flared up, lighting her face in a warm glow. The heat wrapped around her like a final goodbye to everything she and Marc once had.



Just as the photo burned halfway through,she heard the front door creak open. Her heart skipped a beat as she turned and saw Marc walking in.
###Chapter 9 Return His Jacket



Stella frowned slightly, confused by how quickly Marc had returned.



Half of the photo in the metal basin was still burning, the past literally curling into ash before her eyes. On instinct, she shifted her stance,subtly placing herself between Marc and the basin, trying to block his view.



His steps halted as he noticed the flickering flames. "What are you burning?" he asked with a mild frown.



"Nothing important. Just tossing out some old junk," she replied casually. "What brings you back?"



He didn't press further. With a tired look, he said,"Forgot something. Just came to grab it," and walked upstairs.



As he climbed the stairs, he stayed glued to his phone, his fingers tapping away at something urgent.
Forgot something?


Stella's lips tugged into a wry smile. She stayed still, quietly watching as he disappeared upstairs and returned minutes later.



By the time he returned, the flames had died,leaving behind only ash. He walked over,gave her a quick hug, and brushed a kiss against her cheek, all too routine. "Stella, I'm sorry. Work's been nonstop lately. Once it eases up, I'll make it up to you," he said with a sigh. "If only I could spend more time here with you."



How painfully insincere.



His phone buzzed again. Without even checking the screen, he pulled away. "I've got to run," he said,already halfway out the door.


And just like that, he was gone again-no glance back. But Stella didn't hurt anymore. Her heart had long gone numb.


Marc hadn't noticed, but she had. The phone screen had lit up while he stood next to her, and it was Haley's message, plain as day. "Bring the
ultra-thin condoms. If you forget, don't even think about touching me tonight!"


She went upstairs, opened the bedside drawer,and sure enough-the box of ultra-thin condoms was gone.



She had never agreed to use them, but he'd found someone who would. Not a single one left behind.



He'd been in the room minutes ago and hadn't even noticed the missing wedding photo.



Did he really think she wouldn't catch on? Or was he just that shameless?



Marc didn't come home that night.



There was a time when Stella would've stayed awake, clinging to her phone, waiting for a text that never came.



But tonight, after burning their memories and cleaning up, she climbed into bed. The sheets felt soft, and the room was quiet.


She fell asleep quickly, without a single dream.
The next morning, Stella stretched slowly. For the first time in a while, she felt well-rested.



As she blinked up at the soft morning light,something suddenly popped into her head-the coat. The one she had bought for William. It was still hanging in the closet, and she'd meant to give it to him today.



Later, at the research center, she went up to William's office, only to find the room empty.


Just then,Lainey emerged from the break room.Stella stopped her. "Is Mr. Briggs not in today?"she asked,puzzled.



Lainey arched an eyebrow, her eyes filled with quiet amusement.



Catching the teasing glint in Lainey's narrowed eyes, Stella hurried to explain, "I'm only here to return his jacket. Last time, I had an accident-my period started, and I messed up my pants.Mr.Briggs lent me his coat, that's all."


Lainey laughed, shaking her head. "Relax, 1never said a word. He's in meetings all day.Don't think you'll catch him around here."
A meeting made sense.


William held a senior position-of course he was busy.





Lainey returned to her workstation. Stella glanced around, then borrowed a sticky note from her desk.



On the note she scribbled, "Mr. Briggs, the jacket you lent me was custom-made, so l bought another of equal value to return. If you're not satisfied, feel free to contact me."



Then she hesitated briefly before adding her number at the bottom.
###Chapter 10 Patent Renewal



Even if it didn't look that way on the surface,Stella truly had no hidden intentions, and she simply didn't want to owe William anything.



After slipping the note into the shopping bag,she quietly made her way to William's office.



The space was spotless, everything lined up perfectly as if untouched by time. She didn't linger. With a respectful pause, she set the bag on his desk and quietly backed out, making sure not to glance at anything that wasn't hers to see.



Once outside the office,Stella let out a soft breath. With that task done, she turned her thoughts to the upcoming research project and how she might begin getting more involved.But just as she reached the corridor, her phone buzzed in her bag.



She pulled it out, her brows drawing together when she saw the caller ID.
After a pause, she accepted the call.


"Mrs. Walsh, the patent contract has expired,"said Marc's assistant, his tone all business,completely detached. "We'll be sending someone to your villa with the new documents for you to sign."



For years, Stella had let Marc use her patents without asking for a cent. The contract had always listed a price, but she never collected it.Back then, she believed they were one family,and Marc had said nothing to make her think otherwise.



He probably assumed that being married ggave him ownership over everything she had.



And now, instead of calling her himself, he had his assistant handle it like she was just another supplier.



Stella's grip tightened around the phone.



Maybe she was never anything more than a convenient source of free profit.
No pay required. Just empty promises she'd swallowed whole.



"There's no need for that. I'm free today anyway, so don't trouble your people," she said calmly, then ended the call before the assistant could say anything more.



In the early days of their marriage, she'd visited Marc's office often, especially when her inventions needed adjusting. She used to know everyone in the building. Lately, though,she hadn't stepped foot inside. But even if their marriage was falling apart, she was still his partner. Showing up wasn't just her right-it was long overdue.



Stella tucked her phone away and took a taxi to the company.



The moment she walked through the front doors, heads turned. Everyone knew who she was. The receptionist stood up quickly, offering a polite but slightly stunned smile. "Mrs. Walsh!It's been a while-what brings you in today?"



Stella smiled politely, unfazed by the subtle
nervousness in the girl's voice. "Just here to sign a contract. Is Marc in?"



The two receptionists exchanged glances. "Mr.Walsh...should be."



Without another word, Stella made her way to the elevator.



As the doors began to close, she caught a glimpse of the receptionist picking up the phone in a rush, but she didn't care enough to stop and wonder why.



The elevator opened on the top floor-the executive level. Marc's office was there,along with the legal department.


Stella was planning to head straight to legal when Marc's assistant, Kody, came rushing around the corner. "Mrs. Walsh! You're here!" he exclaimed, breathless and jittery.



His face was tight with unease, though he tried to plaster on a calm smile. The result was painfully awkward.



"I know where the legal department is," Stella
replied coolly, stepping forward.


But Kody quickly moved to her side, almost too obviously trying to block her view down the corridor.



Marc's office was just a short walk away,separated from the legal wing by a narrow passage.



Even though Kody tried to block her line of sight, Stella still managed to catch a glimpse inside Marc's office, and sure enough,she let out a quiet, sarcastic scoff. Who else could it be but Haley?



From where she stood, she could clearly see Haley sitting on the edge of Marc's desk, leaning in toward him. The two were whispering back and forth, smiling as if no one else existed.

###Chapter 11 Slap Haley


Without giving Marc's office a second glance,Stella composed herself and walked toward the legal department, as if she hadn't seen a thing.



Inside, Marc happened to glance toward the hallway mid-flirt. His heart skipped a beat when he caught sight of Stella walking past.


A sharp breath lodged in his throat, and his smile instantly vanished, replaced by a grim scowl.



"You need to leave. Now," he said curtly, the warmth in his voice gone.



Haley blinked in confusion, lips still curved in a teasing smile. "What's gotten into you?"


His grip on her wrist tightened unintentionally,making her flinch in discomfort.



But before she could press further, Marc stormed out of the room, his steps purposeful and tense.
He caught up to Stella, softening his voice."Stella, why are you here? What you saw back there... it wasn't what it seemed."



Stella cut him off with a calm flick of her wrist."Relax. I get it-just work, right? You two enjoy yourselves. I'm just here to handle the paperwork and go."



Her tone was so casual it almost sounded like indifference, but the message was clear-she hadn't come to spy.



Still, Marc stood stiffly, the tension in his body betraying his guilt.



From the doorway, Haley peeked out and noticed their strained exchange.



Her manicured fingers curled into fists, while her eyes narrowed with suspicion and irritation.



With deliberate elegance, she strutted toward them with a syrupy smile on her face. Tossing her curls, she purred in Achure, "Marc, you were amazing last time. I haven't stopped thinking about it.Honestly, working with you is the best
decision I've ever made."



Then,shooting Stella a smug glance,she added with a wink, "Sweetheart, I'll be waiting at the hotel. Got a surprise for you-brand-new lingerie, just how you like it."



Of course, Stella knew Haley was being deliberately provocative.


She knew full well Stella spoke Achure, and yet she flaunted it right there, loud enough for anyone nearby to hear.


Truly, the woman had no shame.


Marc's jaw tightened, his expression darkening as he turned to respond-but Stella cut in again.


"Lingerie? Really, Ms. Smith? Aren't you bold?Maybe I should remind you that Mr. Walsh and I are still legally married, and yet here you are,shamelessly throwing yourself at him. Where l come from, women like you have a name-homewrecker, or worse, a tramp."


She spoke in clear Ushainese, loud enough for everyone to hear. The moment the words left
her lips, the room fell silent, and all eyes turned toward her in shock.



Everyone already knew Marc and Haley were close,but no one expected them to flaunt it so openly,right under Stella's nose.



And Haley trying to stir things up in Achure,thinking Stella wouldn't understand?



That level of arrogance was almost laughable.



Haley, fluent in Ushainese despite her act,hadn't anticipated Stella firing back so sharply and so publicly.



Her face flushed deep red. With everyone staring, she wished she could melt into the floor.



She stumbled over a feeble lie. "Sorry, I... didn't catch what you said."



Stella chuckled coldly. "Oh, that's no problem.I'll be happy to say it again-in Achure this time."



Then, without blinking, she pronounced "homewrecker" and "tramp" in perfect Achure.
Stella's calm demeanor only made Haley's humiliation feel more severe.



Surrounded by stares, Haley felt like the ground was slipping beneath her.



She had always been spoiled, used to being adored and protected, never once enduring this kind of public embarrassment.



Her face twisted with rage, and with a shrill voice, she screamed, "You frumpy old bitch!Who do you think you are? I'll kill you-" She lunged forward, her hand raised to slap Stella.


But before she could land the hit, Stella caught it mid-air with a grip of steel, and without hesitation, slapped her-once, twice. Then she yanked Haley's hair and didn't stop.



Slaps rang through the hallway, mingling with Haley's high-pitched shrieks, shattering the stunned silence of the office floor.



Meanwhile, Marc's face contorted in panic."Stella! What the hell are you doing?"
He charged forward and shoved her with force.




The sudden push caught her off guard. She stumbled, and her head slammed into the wall with a sickening thud. Pain exploded across her skull as the world tilted slightly around her.
###Chapter 12 Getting Into The Wrong Car


Startled,Kody rushed forward,steadying Stella before she could fall. "Mrs. Walsh, are you okay?"


Marc blinked, surprised by how hard he had pushed her. Even with one arm wrapped protectively around Haley, a flicker of regret flashed through his eyes. His lips parted slightly,as if he wanted to say something, but he hesitated and swallowed the words.



Stella, having calmed herself, brushed off Kody's supporting arm. Her eyes shifted to Marc,and in that quiet stare was a coldness sharper than any slap-icy, detached, and distant, just like the way her heart now felt toward him.



Marc winced beneath her frostbitten gaze but forced his voice steady. "Stella, enough with the drama. I've already told you, this isn't what you think. Why do you keep putting Haley down?You even crossed the line with violence. This is a workplace, you should leave."
Then he softened his tone as he faced Haley."Ms. Smith, don't take what she said personally.She didn't mean it. I'm sorry on her behalf."


Haley's anger melted into smug satisfaction as Marc defended her. She slid her arms around his neck,batting her lashes. "For you, I'll let it slide.But she better stay away from the company.Tell her to get lost."


Marc's face tightened at Haley's harsh words.Turning back to Stella, concern shadowed his features. "Stella, this is the company. Can we not make a scene? It won't look good if this gets out."


But Stella stood tall, her posture firm and unwavering. She threw the two of them a cold,scornful glance, her voice steady and cutting."Save the fake politeness. I'll leave as soon as I'm done. But Marc, you're truly disgusting."



Without another word, she spun on her heel and strode toward the legal department,leaving the pair locked in their own world behind her.



Marc watched her retreating figure, and a
strange knot tightened in his chest. Maybe he had been too rough earlier.



Letting go of Haley, he massaged his temples wearily and asked Kody, "Where did she go?"



Kody lowered his voice."Legal department.And,um... Mr. W/alsh, Mrs. Walsh hit herself harder than we thought."



Marc paused for a moment, pushing aside Haley's continued protests as he moved quickly toward the legal department.




...



In the quiet legal office, Stella sank into a leather armchair. "I'm done selling that patent.Now that the contract's expired, our partnership is over."



The legal staff exchanged confused looks.



This patent had been a cornerstone of their collaboration-why was it suddenly being withdrawn?



One of them finally spoke up, trying to keep
their tone respectful, "Mrs. Walsh, is there a problem with the contract?"



Stella shook her head firmly. "No issues with the contract. I've simply found a new buyer."



Marc walked in just in time to catch the tail end of Stella's words. His brows drew together,his voice firm but not unkind.



"Stella, if you're upset, take it out on me. Yell at me, hit me-whatever you want. But don't mess around with the patent. That's serious business. Let's talk about this at home, alright?"



So that was it? He still thought she was being emotional? That she was just throwing a fit,and all it would take was a little coaxing to get her back in line?



The thought almost made Stella laugh. Her expression didn't change, but the coldness in her eyes deepenedd. "I'm not joking, Marc. The deal is off. I'm not renewing the contract.And if your company continues using my patent without permission, I'll have my lawyer file for compensation."
She picked up her bag with a calm, final motion,turned, and walked out without sparing him even a glance.



"Stella!" Marc called after her, stepping forward,but someone from the legal team intercepted him.



"Mr. Walsh, what's going on?" the man asked in alarm. "If she pulls the patent, we're in trouble.We've got multiple active projects riding on that technology. This could hit our bottom line hard."



Marc's face darkened. "I'll handle it."



And with that, he rushed after Stella.



She had to be acting out of anger. That had to be it. Stella wasn't reckless-she wouldn't tank the company over a personal fight.


If he could just talk to her, explain things properly, she'd understand. She always did.



Meanwhile, Stella stepped into the elevator and called for a ride.
When she reached the building's entrance, a sleek black car glided to a stop right before her.



Without a second thought, she opened the passenger door and slid inside.



It wasn't until she'd settled in her seat that she noticed someone else already inside-sitting in the back, wearing a serious, unreadable expression.



Their eyes met in the rearview mirror. The energy in the car shifted immediately.
###Chapter 13 The Wrong Ride



It was William!


Stella blinked in surprise. What were the odds? How did he end up in the very car she thought she'd booked?


Even Wiliam looked mildly taken aback, his one brow lifting with quiet curiosity.


Without thinking,she blurted out, "What are you doing here?"


William raised a brow, his tone dry and just slightly amused. "Ms. Russell, if you needed a ride, my driver would've been happy to take you. But climbing into my car like this? A bit bold, don't you think? Or is this a habit of yours-confusing cars...or people?"


Meeting his deep, unreadable gaze, Stella finally realized her mistake-she'd entered the wrong car.


She hadn't checked the plate-just saw the same model and color as the one she'd booked and got in without thinking. She never expected to mess up like this.


Still, did he have to be so sharp-tongued about it?
Then again, thinking back, she did owe him an apology.



Taking a breath, she composed herself. "I'm sorry, MMr.Briggs. I didn't realize this was your car. My mistake.I'll get out."


But just as her hand touched the door handle,William's voice stopped her. "Wait."



She turned, puzzled. "Yes, Mr. Briggs?"


She'd already apologized. Surely he wouldn't dwell on something this minor?


His gaze carried a quiet weight-so intense it felt suffocating,even though he hadn't raised his voice.


Was he actually upset? Just because of this? Or was it something more?


William spoke in his usual calm, deliberate tone. "I saw the note in the jacket you returned. Frankly, since l gave it to you, I wasn't expecting it back. Ms. Russell,I'd rather you focus on your responsibilities. The least you can do is show some professionalism."


His words caught her off guard. Did he really think she'd left her number in some desperate attempt to flirt? That she got into his car today on purpose?


She opened her mouth to explain, but he had already
stepped out of the car,leaving her in silence.


Heat rose to Stella's cheeks. How could she even begin to explain that night? It was impulsive,thoughtless. Better left forgotten. Some things just couldn't be talked away.


She slipped into the correct car this time and slumped into the back seat with a heavy sigh.


When she arrived at the research institute, she got straight to work, sorting through her things.


Lainey, who was helping nearby, swung a cabinet door open and accidentally whacked the back of Stella's head.



Stella let out a cry, instinctively holding her head as dizziness swept over her.


Alarmed, Lainey gently pulled her hand aside to take a look.



The area was red,alreadyswelling,with a few spots of blood seeping out-it looked worse than she expected.


Lainey gasped. "Oh no, Stella! That looks bad. We have to get you to a hospital now."


Stella winced but waved her off. "It's okay, really. No need for the hospital. I'll be fine. And it's not your
fault."


Not her fault? Lainey hesitated, then remembered Stella had said she was going to see Marc earlier.


Her expression darkened. She grabbed Stella's shoulders. "Tell me the truth. Did that scumbag Marc lay a hand on you?"


Once Stella had regained her balance, she quietly explained what had gone down at Marc's company."Lainey, don't stress. I promise it's not serious. I'll be fine in a few days."


But Lainey wasn't pacified. She was fuming."Unbelievable! You're his wife-how dare he hit you over some other woman?"


Watching Lainey rage, Stella's lips tightened.


Yes, over another woman, her own husband had shoved her.


When had he turned into this kind of man?


Or maybe... he'd always been like this, and she'd just been too blind to see it.


While she stood lost in thought,her phone suddenly rang.
Lainey glanced at the screen and scowled. It was Marc
###Chapter 14 Using The Patent For Free



"Unbelievable. He actually dares to call you? Don't answer, Stella-it'll only make you feel worse."



Stella silently agreed. Lainey had a point. She wasn't planning on answering in the first place, so she calmly hit the reject button.



But barely a few seconds passed before the phone lit up again,buzzing with the same name-relentless,like he couldn't take a hint.


Lainey's patience snapped. As the phone buzzed again,she slammed her finger on the answer button before Stella could stop her.


"How dare you keep calling her? You're her husband,yet you're out there messing around with someone else, and now you raise your hand at her too? Just stop. She doesn't want to hear your voice ever again."


Marc was caught off guard-he hadn't expected anyone else to pick up her phone.


Hearing Lainey's words, his expression darkened. So Stella had told her? He wasn't thrilled.
This was between husband and wife-what business did others have meddling?


"This is between me and Stella. I called her. I don't see how it involves you."


Lainey bristled, her voice sharp with fury. "How is it not my business? I'm her friend-her real friend.If something affects her, it is my business."


Marc's tone dropped, sharp and icy. "You must be incredibly free if you've got time to stick your nose where it doesn't belong. But if you want to meddle,fine by me-"


The phone was still on speaker, and every word Marc said echoed in the room, clear for Stella to hear.


She knew that tone all too well. When Marc started talking like this, calm but cutting, it meant he was angry,trying to intimidate.


Not wanting Lainey to be dragged into this any further,Stella quietly reached for the phone and took it from her.


Her voice carried a hint of coldness. "Marc, she's my friend. The least you can do is show her some respect.You're the one cheating and still trying to have it all.I'm not answering because just hearing your voice
disgusts me."


It was rare for her to speak to Marc with such open contempt. But today, she couldn't hold it back.


Marc's tone shifted immediately, his voice softening."Stella, I know I messed up. I'm really sorry. Please don't be angry anymore. Let's talk calmly when you get home,okay?"


"You honestly make me sick," Stella snapped. "You want both sides,both women-do you even hear how pathetic that sounds?"


There was no point in pretending anymore.


What she felt now wasn't just anger-it was a gut-deep disgust.


Marc paused, then spoke again in a lower and more deliberatevoice. "Stella, I'll wait for you at home. Just give me one chance to explain; that's all I'm asking.You wouldn't want me showing up at your institute,right? If your coworkers and boss see me, that won't be good for you. So please... just do the smart thing.Come home."



Stella's chest tightened. That same suffocating grip of Marc's control wrapped around her again.


It wasn't an empty threat-she knew him too well.
If he decided to show up at the institute, he wouldn't just cause a stir-he'd dig until he found something,and that would ruin everything she had quietly planned for.



After a pause, she forced herself to breathe,swallowed the fire risingin her throat, and softened her voice. "Fine. I'll go back after I finish up here."


On the other end, Marc's voice relaxed instantly,even carrying a hint of satisfaction. "That's my girl. It's been a while since we had a nice dinner together.I'll wait for you."


As the call ended, Stella felt her whole body go rigid.


Her hand,still wrapped around the phone, had turned pale from how tightly she was holding it.


Lainey looked at Stella with concern. "Stella... what if he hits you again when you go back? Let me come with you..."


But before she could finish, Stella met her gaze and gave a small, reassuring smile. "He won't. Trust me, he wouldn't dare."



Lainey didn't look convinced. Her eyes searched Stella's face for any sign of doubt, but after a long moment, she gave in with a reluctant nod.
Later that evening, after wrapping things up at the institute, Stella returned to the villa.


As she stepped inside, Marc was already waiting for her on the living room sofa. He'd changed into relaxed clothes and looked calm, as if the events of earlier had never happened. The moment he saw her, he stood and reached for her hand with easy familiarity."I had the chef make all your favorites tonight. Come on,let's eat."



Stella forced down the queasy feeling swirling in her stomach, took her seat in silence, and barely touched her food. She kept her head down,saying almost nothing the entire meal.


Later, back in the bedroom, she stood in front of the mirror, staring at her reflection-at the exhaustion behind her eyes, at the woman she barely recognized.



Moments later, Marc stepped outof the bathroom and slowly walked over. He leaned forward, trying to kiss her cheek.



But as if on instinct, Stella shifted away, putting space between them.



He froze for a second, a flicker of impatience tightening his jaw.
Still, he kept his tone even.


"Stella, about what happened earlier.. I didn't mean for it to blow up like that. You know how things are,right? Haley's family has deep ties to our company.I can't afford to upset them. But I get it, I went too far with you." He let out a sigh and continued, "That's why I'm giving you full admin access to the security system.You'll be able to check any footage, any time you want. This company is yours too. You're practically half the boss here. So... don't stay mad at me,okay?"



He was trying-pretending, perhaps-to make peace.


Seeing her unresponsive, he reached for her hand and gently rubbed his thumb along her fingers. "I promise,this won't happen again. Today was the last time.Just trust me,please."


But Stella pulled her hand back, her voice low and laced with irony. "Half the boss, huh? Is that your way of saying you'll keep using my patent without paying a cent?"
###Chapter 15 Be Reviewed By William Personally


Marc stared at Stella quietly, choosing his words carefully. "Stel, please don't stay upset. You know l can't stand it when you're cold with me or when you pull away like this. Haley's about to finish school, and her parents are nervous about her joining some other firm. Our partnership with them means a lot for the company. I only see her as a friend-nothing beyond that,really."


But the more he explained, the more it felt like he was trying to cover something up.


If he genuinely thought he'd done nothing wrong,why keep repeating himself?


Deep down, even he knew that what happened with Haley had gone too far.


Stella's voice turned sharp, her eyes distant. "Would you kiss a friend like that? Hold her in your arms, like you did in your office?"


Marc's expression wavered briefly, but he quickly changed the subject.
"Stel, let's have a baby," he said instead. "Didn't you always say you wanted one? If we have a child, you'll always be my wife. You won't feel so insecure anymore."


A cold shiver passed through her. Yes, once upon a time,she had wanted that-a child with him.



But that was back when she believed she was the only one in his heart.


Back when having a child felt like the most natural thing-a piece of the love they shared, a future built together.


And now, after what he did with Haley,right in front of everyone,how could he still have the audacity to talk about having a baby?


Did he think a child was some kind of bargaining chip?Just a way for her to hold on to the title of Mrs.Walsh?


Was she supposed to accept being humiliated,sharing him with another woman,just for that?


Was being Mrs. Walsh even something she cared about anymore?


At that moment, it hit her-Marc never really understood her at al1. Everything they had, all those
years, now felt like some tragic jok<e.


Without a word, she shut her eyes and quietly slipped under the covers.



Marc, however, took her silence as a green light.Smiling faintly, he switched off the light and wrapped his arms around her like everything between them was just fine.



As his breath brushed against her ear, Stella's stomach turned. She kept her voice steady and muttered, "I've got a headache, maybe some other time."



Marc paused,caught off guard. He finally remembered the injury she sustained ealier. "Maybe the wound didn't get handled right. Let me grab the first aid kit -if it gets infected, that's serious! I'm sorry,Stella.I should've paid attention."



Stella let out a short,bitter laugh.She shoved his hand away and stepped aside. "Lainey already took care of it. No need for your concern."


Marc's face sank, the rejection hitting him like a splash of cold water.


Stella couldn't take another moment beside him. "I'll sleep in the study," she said quietly, slipping on her shoes and walking out without looking back. Marc didn't stop her and watched her go.
He had to admit Stella had always been stunning. From her graceful figure to her flawless looks, she effortlessly drew every eye in the room.


She wasn't just beautiful-she was unforgettable.


And yes, he did love her. He loved the way she stood by him all these years, unwavering in her loyalty. He loved the stability she brought to his life, the way her presence grounded him.


As for the women outside? They were just passing flings, brief moments of thrill. None of them could ever replace Stella.


He'd never let anyone take her place as Mrs. Walsh.


He just wanted some variety, that's all-it was a mistake any man could make.


It didn't mean he didn't care for her.



She was just angry now, but he was sure she'd come around.



The following morning, Stella had already left for the research institute by the time Marc even opened his eyes. She didn't bother waiting for him.


As soon as she arrived, Lainey rushed over and pulled her aside. "Stella, something's changed. They've made



adjustments to the team for the closed project."


Stella's heart skipped a beat. Her voice shook. "What do you mean? I thought the list was final. Why would it change now?"



Lainey frowned,clearly just as frustrated. "I'm not sure.They said they'll release the updated list later.William's on the project too now. Because of his position, he has to personally review every name on the team."



A wave of unease hit Stella.



If everyone was being reviewed again, that meant even those who had already been selected could lose their spot-hers included!











































###Chapter 16 Stepping Stones To Power



Stella wasn't sure why the rule had been changed SO suddenly, but given how awkward her last exchange with William had been, she couldn't shake the feeling that he changed the rule because of it.


Still, this was her one shot at changing her current life,and she wasn't about to let it go to waste. If William had misunderstood her, she'd clear things up-no matter what it took.



"William's brilliant when it comes to research," Lainey gushed. "But let's be real. The Briggs family basically owns half of Briset. He's their only heir, so I figure he's just here enjoying some freedom before heading back to take over the empire."



Whether it was admiration or fascination, Lainey clearly loved talking about him.



Stella said nothing,her expression unreadable and her thoughts tucked far away.



William's famnily wealth didn't impress her. In her eyes,he was simply a fellow researcher-nothing more,nothing less.





What his family owned or controlled had absolutely nothing to do with her goals.


All she wanted was this opportunity-to get her foot in the door and never look back.


Lainey,mid-ramble, suddenly lit up with a mischievous grin and elbowed Stella. "Hey, imagine if you actually won over William. Wouldn't that drive your pathetic husband crazy? Just picture it-once this project wraps up,you'd have both a thriving career and a man who's way better than Marc. Sounds like a win-win,doesn't it?"



Stella let out a soft laugh. Lainey's imagination never failed to amaze her.



Right now, her mind was laser-focused on research.Men, love, or revenge-none of that had a place in her current world. Getting into the team was all that mattered.



So,if William was truly the one rechecking the list,then she needed to speak with him directly.


But then, this wasn't the right place-not here at the research institute with so many people watching.She needed a better time and a more private setting to approach him.








Stella looked up and asked calmly, "Lainey, can you help me get a moment alone with Mr. Briggs?"


Lainey's eyes lit up with excitement. "Of course! Leave it to me!"



A private meeting?


She was already daydreaming about being their matchmaker.


With that settled, Stella felt a small sense of relief and threw herself back into her work.


That afternoon, when she got home, she didn't expect company,but Marc was there, sitting on the sofa like he belonged.


He lounged casually, flipping through a magazine while she silently changed out of her shoes by the door.



The moment he saw her, he stood up with a smile."You're home. Are you hungry? I can ask the kitchen to make something."



He wore that same warm, attentive mask, acting like there had never been betrayal, never been distance.


Stella couldn't help but find his act utterly ridiculous -laughable,even.




Marc used to tell her he was swamped with work,claiming he couldn't make it home regularly. And she had believed him.


Back then, before she learned the truth about him and Haley,she had trusted his every word. She never once questioned why he stayed out late or didn't show up at all.


But now that everything had come to light, now that the illusion had shattered, he suddenly had all this free time to come back and play house?


If work had really kept him so busy before,then how was he finding the time now?


"I'm not hungry. Eat by yourself." Her voice was cold,detached. She didn't have the strength or desire to sit across from him and pretend things were normal. Even his smile made her sick.



She headed upstairs without sparing him another glance, but Marc's brows knitted together, clearly displeased.


"Stella, skipping meals isn't good for your health. Just tell me what you want, and I'll have my assistant bring it."



Stella paused at the bottom of the staircase, turned






back slightly, and lifted an eyebrow. "Looking at you ruins my appetite."



That shut him up. He glanced at the fading bruise on her head and knew she was saying it to humiliate him.Still,her words stung more than he expected.


After a brief silence,he took a deep breath and tried again, "Didn't you once say you wanted to visit Hoxphis for a vacation? I'll be free next month. Let's go together."


Her brows lifted again. She had brought up the idea of visiting Hoxphis more than once after they got married, but Marc always brushed it aside, either blaming work or promising he'd "arrange it later."



Now,out of nowhere, he was eager for a trip? If she hadn't pulled the plug on the company's collaboration,she knew full well he wouldn't have even considered taking time off during such a crucial phase.


His efforts to please her now were painfully obvious.Anyone could see right through it. It wasn't about love or reconciliation-it was about the patent she controlled.



Just for that patent, he was now magically clearing his schedule and pretending to be the devoted husband again.








To Marc, both she and Haley were just stepping stones to power, and nothing more.



Stella let out a dry laugh. "I don't want to go to Hoxphis anymore. I've got better things to do. If you're still set on that trip, why don't you take Haley instead?"



Marc's expression turned stormy the moment she said that. "Stella, don't talk to me like that. I hate it."


Her bluntness annoyed him. He had apologized,hadn't he? Why couldn't she just move on?


He really did want to take her to Hoxphis.


It wasn't like he ever held back when it came to making her happy, so what more did she want from him?



"Then how exactly am I supposed to talk toyou?"she said sharply. "Should I just sit down and have a pleasant litte heart-to-heart?"


Her sarcasm dripped like acid, but Marc missed the jab completely. "Yeah, we should definitely talk," he replied seriously.


That made Stella laugh-not from amusement, but disbelief.




Fine. If he wanted to talk, they would talk. She was curious anyway.


Was it just about the patent, or was he after something else too? Either way, she was done playing along.

###Chapter 17 Making Haley
Happy



Stella walked over and sat down on an armchair,keeping a noticeable distance between them. Marc's eyes stayed on her.


"Alright,what is it you wanted to say?" she asked flatly.


Marc's tone turned serious.



"Stella, there's nothing going on between me and Haley beyond work. You're getting the wrong idea.This collaboration with the Smith family could really take our company to the next level. Mr. Smith himself suggested that Haley should gain some hands-on experience by working here. And honestly,with her background in international law and her plan to stay here long-term, I can't think of a more fitting role for her than the legal department."



The moment he started talking about Haley, Stella silently scoffed.



"What does her joining legal have to do with me?"She thought to herself.



So that trip to Hoxphis-of course, it wasn't about her





at all.It was for Haley.


Marc leaned a little closer, trying to soften the gap between them. "This is why I brought it up. If your patent stays with us, it'll be the first project Haley takes on after joining. She'll be pleased, her family will be impressed, and it helps our company in the long run."


As far as Marc was concerned, he had laid everything out plainly.


This was about business.


They needed the Smith family on their side, and if Haley was happy, things would go smoothly.


As for Stella? All she had to do was sign a document -it wasn't anything new. She'd always sold her patents to him without much fuss. Today was probably just one of her rare moments of defiance.



Once she calmed down, she'd go back to doing what she always did.


When he finished, he looked at her with that familiar,gentle expression. "You won't turn me down, will you,Stella? It's just a renewal-nothing changes for you."



Stella didn't feel moved-she felt sick.











Her gaze was cold as she spoke slowly, each word deliberate. "So this whole talk... is about using my patent to make Haley happy?"


What kind of twisted logic was that? How could he say something so absurd with a straight face?




Seeing her frustration, Marc frowned. "I'm just being honest. A strong company benefits both of us. We're married, Stella. Isn't it normal for a couple to support each other?"



Normal? The word echoed in her head, and suddenly,she had nothing more to say.



Every time he spoke, he somehow managed to make himself even more pathetic.


She rose to her feet, towering over Marc with a piercing gaze.



"This is my patent," she said icily. "I've changed my mind. I'm not selling. And no one, not even you, has the right to force me."



Marc hadn't expected her to be this uncooperative. He had already swallowed his pride, offered a vacation,and even put work aside.



Why was she being so unreasonable?





Losing his patience, he got up with a hardened look."Enough. This conversation is over. Go to the office tomorrow and sign the renewal. Don't act likea child."


Without waiting for her reply, he turned and walked upstairs.


Stella stared after him, and her lips curled into a bitter smile.



Maybe the truth was simple-they were never meant for each other. There was no use arguing anymore. It was a waste of breath.


Despite this, her emotions didn't settle.


Her eyes rested on the coffee table, but her chest felt tight-so tight she could barely take a proper breath.


He really had the nerve to say it was only normal for her to help him-like it was expected, like she owed him.



The thought made her let out a bitter, hollow laugh.The sound echoed through the quiet living room,soaked in loneliness and disbelief.



Her head throbbed again, the pain from yesterday's injury creeping back as if in sync with her heartache.


That night, she stayed in the study, curling up alone.



But deep into the night; she was jolted awake by the sound of someone trying to open the door from the outside.





































###Chapter 18 Trap Her



Before going to bed, Stella had made sure to lock the door from the inside, and not just that, she'd even taken the spare key from the storeroom with her.


So when someone tried to open the door in the middle of the night, it didn't budge. After a few moments of struggle, the person outside finally gave up.


The noise had woken her. Lying in the quiet darkness,she stared at the ceiling, unable to fall back asleep.


Curiosity got the better of her, and she checked the surveillance footage, and as expected-it was Marc.



But by then,he was gone.


Knowing she had a full day ahead, Stella made herself close her eyes and tried to fall back asleep.


The next morning, she got ready and headed straight to the research institute, brushing off everything Marc had said the night before.



She wasn't the same wife he used to manipulate so easily. That version of her was long gone.






From the moment she made up her mind, their marriage was over in her heart.


Once at the institute, she threw herself into work and pushed everything about last night far from her mind.


It wasn't until her phone rang that she paused her work and looked at the screen.


The name flashing on the screen was "Allegra"-someone from Marc's legal department.


Allegra had once helped Stella when the latter was at Marc's company, and Stella had always been polite and thankful for it.



Seeing her name pop up now caught Stella off guard.


They'd only ever spoken for work, never anything personal, unless something unusual had happened...


With a few uneasy guesses forming, Stella picked up the call.


"Hey Allegra, what's going on?"


Allegra's voice cracked when she heard Stella. After a pause,she steadied herself and said, "Ms. Russell, Mr.Walsh asked me to inform you that you need to come to the office today."









Her voice wavered. She already knew Stella didn't want to come, and there had been talk around the office about her turning down the renewal offer.


But it was a direct order from Marc, and Allegra had no choice but to follow it.


"I'm sorry, Allegra. But I've decided not to work with your company anymore, so I won't be coming in."


Allegra had guessed this might happen, but hearing it directly still left her feeling defeated.


"Ms. Russell, I know you've made up your mind, but Mr.Walsh said if you don't come, it would be considered my error,and I could lose my job."


Stella frowned, stunned. "Wait-are you saying Marc would fire you just because I refuse to come?"


"Ms. Russell, I know you don't want to come, and l understand. But I really have no choice. He said he'd make sure no one else in the industry hires me. I know this is emotional blackmail... but it's fine. I'll find a way somehow."



Allegra choked on her sobs. She didn't want to make things worse for Stela, but she was stuck between loyalty and survival.







Stella's hands trembled with fury.


Marc must've figured out that she and Allegra got along and used that connection to trap her.



He really would stoop to anything just to get his way.


It was so shameless that it almost made her laugh.



Hearing Allegra's shaky sobs,Stella squeezed her eyes shut and said firmly, "I'll come. Don't worry, Allegra.This isn't your fault-he's targeting me, not you.l won't let you lose your job over this."



Allegra's heart clenched at Stella's words. Her panic faded,replaced by gratitude, guilt, and a deep sense of unfairness on Stella's behalf.



"Thank you... thank you so much, Ms. Russell!"


Stella almost said there was no need for thanks-after all,Allegra had once helped her too.


Besides, she wasn't someone who forgot a kindness,no matter how small.


If Marc wanted her there so badly, then fine. She'd go.She wanted to see for herself exactly what kind of game he was playing now.














###Chapter 19 Make Sure She Leaves Humiliated



After collecting her things, Stella said goodbye to Lainey, mentioning she had to head out early.


Lainey gave her a casual nod. "Go on ahead. There's nothing urgent here today anyway."


When Stella reached Marc's company, Haley's sharp,entitled voice was already echoing from inside the legal department.


Just as she was about to step in, Evie-a familiar face from the past-hurried over and tugged Stella aside."Mrs. Walsh, what are you doing here? That Haley girl is clearly targeting you. You really shouldn't go in."


Everyone knew how much losing the patent would hurt the company, but Haley's arrogance had rubbed them all the wrong way.


And on top of that, they all knew Stella was Marc's legal wife, and Haley was nothing more than a mistress, yet she strutted around like she owned the place.



Not sure what she'd walked into, Stella raised a brow.





"What happened?"


Evie pulled a face. "What do you think? First day here and she's already scolding the whole legal team,calling them useless for not landing the deal. Mrs.Walsh,seriously-better not walk in there."


Stella gave her a calm smile, silently letting her know it was alright.


As she walked in, Haley glanced up and spotted her.Reclining on the sofa with her chin lifted high, she wore the smug look of a cat that had just lapped up a bowl of cream.



"Well, look who finally decided to show up," Haley sneered. "You were all high and mighty yesterday,acting like you didn't need the contract. And now?You're back to sign it like nothing happened. If this was where you'd end up anyway, what was all that drama for?"


Haley's eyes were filled with contempt. To her, Stella was nothing in comparison. She was the dignified daughter of the prestigious Smith family from Achury.What did Stella have? Just Marc as a husband-and even that, she believed, was temporary. In her mind,Marc's affections had already shifted. Stella had no right to challenge her.









Stella stood in the legal department's office, listening in silence as Haley rambled on and on. She didn't bother replying.


Her expression was calm, almost indifferent, like none of it mattered.


Eventually,when Haley realized she was the only one speaking, her smug look disappeared. Her face darkened with frustration, and she snapped, "What the hell are you pretending for?"


Stella finally looked her way and let out a quiet chuckle. "If Marc hadn't dragged innocent people into this, I wouldn't be here. So, this is your talent?Manipulating people who have nothing to do with your feud? Impressive."


Haley's face turned red with rage. Stella had hit a nerve. It had been Haley's idea to pressure Stella into showing up by having Marc involve the legal department.


"Stella, all's fair in love and war! If it works, then it works.Now sign the damn contract-right now!"Haley barked.



But Stella just smiled faintly, unbothered. "No. I'm not signing anything."


"You!"



Before the argument could spiral further, Theo Haynes, the vice head of legal, let out a silent sigh. His temples were already starting to throb. He stepped in quickly, trying to defuse the growing tension. "Mrs.Walsh, if something's bothering you, let's talk it through. You are Mr. Walsh's wife,after all. Just let us know what you need, and we'll work something out."


Stella shifted her eyes back to Haley and gave a small smile,calm but cutting. "The reason I'm not renewing the contract? Simple. It's her. If you want my signature,tell your Mr. Walsh to show me some sincerity. And by that, I mean start by kicking Haley out of the company,and make sure she leaves humiliated."













































###Chapter 20 You Really
Think You're That Import...



A heavy silence fell over the room as everyone stared at Stella and Haley, shocked by what they had just heard.



Though most of the staff didn't care much for Haley,they knew better than to cross her. She held an influential position, and even Marc treated her with care. For Stella to tell her to leave the company like that? It sounded impossible.


The employees glanced at one another, utterly lost,while Haley, overwhelmed by humiliation, snatched a cup from the desk and hurled it to the floor with a loud crash.



"Who do you think you are, Stella?" Haley snapped."It's just a damn patent! You think this entire company revolves around you? Well, guess what? I'm not going anywhere! Sign the contract or don't, I really don't give a fuck. But me, walking away? Keep dreaming!"



Theo nearly lost his composure. Just one damn patent? Did Haley even know what she was talking about? Stella's patent brought in massive revenue






every year. The entire company practically stood on it.If she walked away, everything could crumble.


But Haley, blinded by rage, couldn't see past her bruised ego and even dared to tell Stella to get lost.


Meanwhile, Stella had no interest in arguing anymore.Without a word, she turned and walked away.


As she neared the door, Theo, realizing they had crossed a line that couldn't be taken back, hurried after her. "Mrs. Walsh, allow me to walk you out."


It was clear this whole mess was the company's doing,and no one could fault Stella for walking away.



Just before she stepped into the elevator, Theo hesitated, then spoke. "Mrs. Walsh, if you don't mind me saying...would you consider having a word with Mr.Walsh? Haley clearly isn't fit for this role. Keeping her around will only create more problems."



No matter what, Stella was still Marc's wife, and anything she said would carry far more weight than what the employees could express.


And besides, it wasn't exactly a secret-everyone could tell MMarc still had feelings for her.



Stella gave a faint press of her lips but stayed silent.





Before leaving, she made her way to Allegra's desk for a quick goodbye. "Choria's a big city, Allegra," she said calmly. "There's no shortage of companies here that would value someone like you."


Allegra was clever. She knew exactly what Stella was hinting at.


After all, Marc's firm wasn't the only place worth working at-Choria was full of opportunities.


Allegra's eyes brightened, and a knowing smile passed between them. As Stella stepped into the elevator,Allegra called out warmly, "Take care, Mrs. Walsh!"


By the time Stella walked outside, the sun had disappeared behind thick clouds. It had been bright and sunny when she came in, but now the sky looked heavy and gray.


She let out a quiet sigh, thinking it might start raining soon.



Standing by the roadside, watching cars rush past,she quietly reminded herself, "Just five more days, Stella."Only five more. Then all of this would finally be behind her, gone in the blink of an eye.



Meanwhile,back at the company, Haley wasted no time storming into Marc's office,unloading everything






that had happened.


"Marc, you should've seen her! She was completely out of line. I was only doing what you told me-trying to get her to renew the deal, and she turned around and told me to get lost!"


Marc was just wrapping up a meeting when Haley started venting. He looked mildly annoyed but kept his expression composed. He then reached out and gently patted her back in an attempt to calm her down.



"Alright, don't get too worked up. I understand you're angry," he said softly. "Why don't I take you to your favorite place for dinner tonight?"


Hearing that, Haley felt a little less angry, but she still wasn't ready to let it go. Pouting, she clung to his arm and said, "No. I want Stella to kneel and apologize to me!"



She pressed her body against his, making sure he felt every curve.



Marc didn't push her away.



He simply brushed her hair back with deliberate gentleness, like he was indulging her.



Just when she thought he'd cave to her whims,his





next words came like a slap.



"You really think you're that important?" he said, his tone chillingly indifferent.












































###Chapter 21 You Are
Incredible



Haley froze,eyes wide with disbelief. "Wait...What did you just say?" Had she misunderstood him?


Marc's mouth curved into a familiar smile, but there was no softness in his eyes. "Stella is my wife-and always will be. I've said it before, what's between us is nothing more than a fling. Isn't this kind of thing considered normal where you're from? You didn't really think it meant something... did you?"


To him, the position of a wife belonged solely to Stella.



And Haley? She was someone to enjoy in passing.Nothing more,nothing less.


Marc didn't mind keeping her close, so long as she knew her place.


For a second, Haley just stared at him, tryingto process what he'd said.


What was that supposed to mean?


Marc's recent attention made her believe he was








-



 starting to fall for her. Now he was claiming she'd mistaken everything?


Did that worthless woman really mean more to him than she did?


Haley stiffened, her smile fading. "Marc, what are you even talking about right now?"


"Exactly what it sounds like. If you don't like how things are, you're free to walk away." A shadow flickered in Marc's eyes.


He couldn't risk offending the Smith family. But no matter the cost, he'd never replace Stella.


Haley felt a sharp sting in her chest watching the finality in his face.



He wasn't joking after all.


Still, she wasn't someone who quit easily. If she wanted something, she chased it until it was hers.



Marc only clung to Stella because they hadn't spent real time together yet.


But once they did, he'd see that he belonged with her.


With that thought anchoring her, Haley straightened herself and forced a light laugh. "Come on, I was just






messing around. I got carried away-don't be mad.For you, I'll let it slide. I won't pick on her anymore.But... you owe me for that."



Marc watched her, his expression impossible to read."Fine. Whatever you ask for, I'll grant it. Just keep your promise-leave Stella alone."


After leaving Marc's office, Stella didn't head back to the research institute.


With only five days left until the project kicked off,she had to get everything in order before then.


Stella returned to the villa and dropped onto the couch,massaging her weary eyes.



Her phone began to ring. Without checking the screen,she hit the answer button and held it to her ear. "Hello?"


"Stella, there's a party tonight. I managed to snag an invite. You should get dressed and come with me."



Stella blinked slowly, not quite keeping up. "Lainey, I'm really wiped out. I don't think I've got the energy for a party tonight."


"William's attending," Lainey added casually. "It's his friend's event. Weren't you hoping for a chance to talk to him in private?"











That snapped her out of her haze. Stella bolted upright. "Wait-William's going to be there?"


"Yep! And since I'm on the guest list, I can bring you.A relaxed setting like that is perfect for getting closer to him."



Lainey had clearly misunderstood her intentions again,but Stella didn't bother correcting her this time."Alright, I'll be there. Just send me the details."


As soon as the call ended, Stella raced upstairs to get ready.


By the time she came back down, her phone buzzed with a new message. Expecting it to be from Lainey,she tapped on it, only to realize it was from Haley instead.



Stella scowled as she stared at the one-minute voice note. Her thumb hesitated in mid-air before finally pressing play.


Almost immediately, a sultry voice spilled from the speaker, sending a chill down her spine."Oh, Marc,you're incredible... God..."







###Chapter 22 Sitting On
William's Lap



Stella fumbled to hit pause, another surge of nausea churning in her gut.


She lurched over the sink and vomited, her stomach empty except for the sour burn of bile.


Nothing but acid came up-she hadn't managed more than a few bites all day.



It made her skin crawl with pure revulsion.



Never in her wildest nightmares had Stella thought Haley would send her an audio recording like this-audio of her and Marc having sex.



What kind of sick person not only made something like that but sent it out on purpose?



Stella stared at her reflection, pressing a hand to her chest. This wasn't the reaction she'd imagined. No heart pounding, no crushing weight of emotion-just a vague nausea and a strange emptinesS.



Somehow, she'd always suspected Marc could sink this low-nothing about him managed to shock her anymore.


The only thing that truly grated on her was listening to that revolting recording.


After a few steadying breaths, Stella smoothed down her hair, slung her bag over her shoulder, and walked out of the villa.


Outside Light Story, Lainey waited beneath the glow of the entrance lights, her figure striking in a stunning evening gown.


As soon as Stella climbed out of the taxi, Lainey spotted her and waved with unrestrained enthusiasm.


Dressed in a neat white blouse and faded jeans, Stella looked more ready for a business meeting than a night out drinking.


Lainey's lips twitched with disapproval as she looped her arm through Stella's. "Stella, what'swith this outfit?"


Stella blinked and glanced at herself, genuinely puzzled. "Is there something wrong with what I'm wearing?"


She'd picked these clothes on purpose-clean lines,nothing flashy, just right for the occasion.


"We came out to have drinks, not sign contracts. You





look like you're about to pitch a business deal!"


Stella exhaled, resigned. "Fine... Lainey, can we just head inside?"



But Lainey dug in her heels, tugging Stella back."Absolutely not. You're already here, so you need to look the part. Otherwise, how do you expect William to pay any attention to you?" She grinned, triumphant,and held up a garment bag. "Good thing I planned ahead.You're changing-no arguments."



Before Stella could utter another word, Lainey swept her straight into the restroom at Light Story.



Chatting animatedly, Lainey rummaged through her bag and produced a dark red slip dress, thrusting it into Stella's hands.



"Lainey, is this honestly necessary?"



"Absolutely! Come on, try it. You're gorgeous-let everyone see it for once!"


Left with no room to argue, Stella ducked into a stall and reluctantly changed clothes.


Stepping out in the new outfit, she felt like she'd borrowed someone else's skin-uncomfortable and unsure. "Lainey, isn't this dress a little.,. too daring?"





She tugged self-consciously at the hem, certain the dress barely concealed anything front or back.


Lainey surveyed her, beaming with approval. "It's perfect-definitely not too short. You look absolutely gorgeous!"


With her striking curves, smooth skin, and a face made for trouble, Stella belonged in a dress that broadcasted boldness, not hidden away in something dull.


What she wore before? A style disaster begging for a makeover.



Scooping up Stella's discarded shirt and jeans, Lainey crammed them into her bag and steered Stella down the hall toward the private room.


"It's William's childhood friend's birthday tonight.Everyone's here to unwind-so make sure you give William something to look at."


Unsure how to say she wasn't there to impress William,Stella stayed quiet and trailed after Lainey into the room.



Light flooded the largest private room as the doors swung open,revealing a lively crowd of well over a hundred, clustered in animated groups. The air





thrummed with the energy and confidence of the city's young elite.


Lainey guided Stella through the crowd, stopping before a tall man with gleaming gold-rimmed glasses."Grady, meet Stella Russell-she was a few grades behind me back in school. And Stella, this is my friend,Grady Martel."


Stella had never seen Grady before, but out of courtesy, she offered a gentle smile. "It's a pleasure to meet you,Mr.Martel."


Grady, accustomed to people fawning over William,pegged Stella as just another face in the crowd,one of the many hoping for an introduction. Nearly everyone in the city, after all, was desperate to win William's favor.



But the moment he laid eyes on Stella,Grady faltered.Her striking beauty caught him completely off guard.


He cleared his throat and casually grabbed a cocktail from the bar, lifting the glass in Stella's direction."Ms.Russell, here's a bit of advice-take your time. Plenty of people try to cozy up to William, but he doesn't make it easy for just anyone."


Stella could tell exactly what he was implying, but her only concern was settling the list situation as fast aspossible. She offered a stiff nod, feeling her discomfort creeping into her expression.


After a few more polite exchanges, Lainey hooked her arm around Stella and guided her straight toward William.



A noisy crowd had gathered around him, and Lainey had to nudge her way through before they finally made it to the sofa where William lounged.


Raising her glass in greeting, Lainey called out,"Mr.Briggs, what a shock running into you here! This is Stella-she's a colleague of mine at the institute.1think you two might've crossed paths before. She's actually got some questions about a project and would really appreciate your insights."



Lainey gave her a light nudge before she could brace herself.



The nudge wasn't forceful, but Stella was already off -balance-she tripped forward and toppled straight toward William.



She braced for impact, but the sting of a fall never came. Blinking in surprise, she realized she'd landed squarely in William's lap-and the position was far too intimate for comfort.














###Chapter 23 It Is Really A Misunderstanding



The onlookers gasped, their surprise echoing through the room at the abrupt shift in atmosphere.


Even with William sitting right there, no one had ever witnessed anyone so daring-this woman had taken a leap without a hint of hesitation.


Everyone understood William's reputation: cold,detached, and wholly uninterested in romantic entanglements. Was she destined to be dismissed as abruptly as all the others?


But before anyone could draw another breath,William's voice cut through the tension-steady and calm, threaded with annoyance rather than anger."Exactly how long were you thinking of sitting like that?"



For a heartbeat, Stella froze,realization crashing over her as a hot flush swept up her cheeks.



She started to rise, only to feel an abrupt resistance that sent a jolt of dread straight through her.


Panic pricked her skin as she realized her dress had





somehow snagged on something, trapping her in place.


Any sudden movement risked making things even worse for her.


William arched a brow, the shift in weight on his legs drawing his attention.


Stella's entire face flushed with mortification. Even if her position wasn't as outrageous as before, it was still painfully awkward-all the more so because she'd come to have a serious conversation with him.


Struggling to regain her composure, she blurted out,"I'm so sorry, Mr. Briggs. This really wasn't intentional -my dress is caught. Just give me a second,please."



She fumbled to free the tangled fabric, but a mocking laugh sounded from above.


"Ms. Russell, you'll have to do better than that. If you're going to stage an act like this, at least put some effort into subtlety."



Irritation and embarrassment churned inside Stella."That's not what you think, Mr. Briggs. I didn't do any of this on purpose. I came here today because l wanted to talk to you about the exclusive project roster. You've insisted on reviewing every candidate yourself, and I'm hoping you'll consider giving me a shot."



Her plea made William's gaze drift to her cleavage.His eyebrows arched, dry amusement flickering in his eyes. "Is this your way of earning a spot on the team?"



Stella faltered, realizing just how condescending he was being.


She squared her shoulders, lips drawn into a thin line as determination flashed in her eyes.


"I'm serious about joining the project. I've published papers in national journals, and I have patents to my name. I've even conducted research on this project before-there's real value I can bring. And, Mr. Briggs,if you let me join the team,you'll have nothing to worry about. My focus will be on the work itself. I have the skills you're looking for, and..."



For the first time, her words seemed to stumble and fall flat.



Why did every encounter with this man spiral into confusion?



As soon as she tried to list her credentials, William's gaze flicked down to the woman perched awkwardly on his lap.



Stella's long legs stretched across his, sleek and
uncomfortably exposed.



He gave a faint, cutting smile. "Clearly, your talents stretch past what you let slip, Ms. Russell."



Before Stella could even process the jab, he rose smoothly to his feet, leaving her to slip from his lap in a graceless heap.



Flustered, she clamped a hand over her dress, heart thudding.



Yet the moment he stood, the supposed knot between their clothing unraveled easily, as if the whole ordeal had been a trick of the light.



With icy composure, William strode from the room,leaving Stella alone in the awkward silence.



Stella lingered for a moment, a sense of injustice prickling beneath her calm exterior.



She hadn't orchestrated the mishap,yet his accusation hinted she'd tried to leverage her appearance for a spot on the project.



Her jaw tightened as she debated her next move, then strode after him, refusing to back down.



William's long strides ate up the hallway, forcing Stella to pick up her pace, practically trotting to stay close.



"Mr. Briggs, those earlier incidents weren't what you think. I'm not after anything else-I just really want to be part of the project team. I hope you'll let me prove myself.l..."


She barely got the words out before William stopped short. Stella crashed right into his solid arm,thrown off-balance by the sudden halt-her sexy outfit doing nothing to disguise the impact or her embarrassment.



























































###Chapter 24 Quite A Sight In That Dress



This whole situation had spiraled out of control, and trying to explain it now would only make things worse.


That was the only thought pounding in Stella's head.


William turned just enough to glance at her,his face blank. His eyes lingered for a moment-sliding downward, deliberately slow-taking in her bold curves before he turned away and continued walking,not bothering to stop.







Marc stepped out from the bend in the Light Story hallway just as a voice he knew reached his ears.


He turned instinctively, drawn by the familiarity,and spotted a figure that seemed known yet somehow different.


Narrowing his eyes,he took a step forward, intending to get a better look.


But before he could get far, Haley came rushing out of the corridor and flung herself at him, clutching his





 arm tightly. "Marc, what are you staring at?"


Marc's jaw tightened slightly, irritation flickering in his eyes. "Nothing."







Stella trailed behind William, but he made no effort to acknowledge her presence.


Frustrated and desperate, she moved ahead of him,cutting off his path by spreading her arms wide. "Mr.Briggs, I meant every word I said. Please, just give it some thought."


William tilted his head and studied her, his gaze drifting lazily across her frame. "You do make quite the impression. But throwing yourself at me in front of everyone? If I add you to the team now, won't people assume I'm playing favorites?"


Stella's cheeks burned with embarrassment-he had gotten it all wrong. A wave of frustration hit her, and the irritation showed clearly on her face. "It wasn't what you think! That happened by mistake!"


From where he stood, William could not help but see her curves.



His throat moved as he swallowed hard and quickly looked away. "Ms. Russell, you're very skilled at





 leaving a mark on a man. But I'm not fond of women who come on too forward."



William didn't care to understand who Stella truly was.Yet, in just two encounters, she had left an impression on him he couldn't quite shake. One thing was certain -Stella Russell was a clever woman who knew how to attract a man.



At those words, Stella's hands curled into fists at her sides,her body rigid.



When she finally spoke again, her voice had lost all warmth. "Mr. Briggs, I take pride in what I do. I've worked hard to get here-I'm not the kind of woman you're trying to make me out to be."



Stella had given it her all, done everything expected of her, but no matter how much she tried,William's assumptions about her refused to budge.


She exhaled slowly, steadying her breath as she fought to preserve her dignity. That,too,had value.



"I won't bother you again." She turned and walked away without looking back.



William's eyes followed her retreating figure,narrowing faintly, before he turned and stepped back into the private lounge.








The moment he re-entered,Lainey turned toward him."Where's Stella? Didn't she leave with you?"


They had exited almost at the same time-yet now Stella was nowhere to be seen.



William shrugged off the question. "Not sure. Looks like she decided to go."


Lainey blinked, slightly puzzled, then leaned closer to speak in a low voice. "Mr. Briggs, Stella's not just talented; she was once at the top of her field. If she hadn't stepped back for family reasons, she'd be on par with you today. One of the company's most reliable core patents is still hers."


William shot her a dry look. "Really? I thought her specialties were tight dresses and hanging on to powerful men."


There was clear mockery in his tone, and Lainey quickly caught on to the misunderstanding.


Lainey's face turned solemn as she spoke hurriedly."Mr. Briggs, Stella only wore those clothes because insisted. She came dressed in a white shirt and jeans."



To prove it,she rummaged through her bag and pulled out the clothes, offering them for him to see.






William's thoughts drifted to the first time he saw Stella-dressed modestly,confident but understated.Compared to that version of her, the sultry dress had seemed completely out of place.



And now he realized that the outfit hadn't been Stella's.



Still, he couldn't deny that she had looked stunning.




###Chapter 25 Been Too Harsh With Her



After failing to sway William, Stella left the gathering defeated, heading home with heavy steps. As soon as she walked in, she spotted a new message from Lainey lighting up her phone.


"I'm so sorry, Stella. I never should've pushed you to change. If it weren't for me, Williamn wouldn't have misunderstood everything. This is on me. I handled it all wrong andended up making things worse for you."


Stella read the message and let out a weary sigh.



It wasn't just the clothes-William had always viewed her through a lens of suspicion.


She began typing a response. "Don't worry, Lainey.None of this is on you."



If William doubted her, then she'd make damn sure he saw what she was capable of.



She'd prove herself with the same grit and honesty she'd relied on all along.



Lainey's reply came quickly, weighted with guilt.





"Stella, I only thought maybe if you dressed differently,William might actually notice your efforts..."


Now, looking back, she felt like an idiot.


William's logic was impossible to pin down.


"No, really, it's all right, Lainey. I know you had the best intentions. I appreciate you helping arrange my meeting with Mr. Briggs today," Stella typed back.


Whatever happened, she couldn't hold it against Lainey; the girl had only wanted to help.


Seeing Stella's patient reply, Lainey finally let herself relax, though a hint of guilt still gnawed at her. She silently vowed to explain the situation if William's impression of Stella had soured because of her.



Once the messages were sent, Stella set her phone aside and began getting ready for bed.



Right then, the villa's front door swung open, and Marc stepped inside, trailing a sharp wave of alcohol.



Stella's brow creased automatically.



It was so late-she hadn't expected him home tonight.



Marc's head hung low, messy bangs nearly obscuring his face.







Without a word, he fumbled the door shut and lurched across the room, each stride loose and unsteady as he headed straight for her.


When he drew near, a vivid smear of red lipstick caught her eye on his collar.


Now standing this close, Stella couldn't ignore the harsh mix of alcohol and some stinging perfume wafting off him, making her nose prickle uncomfortably.


She stepped back on instinct, trying not to sneeze,but Marc's hand shot out and clamped down on her arm,his fingers digging in.


He leaned close, invading her space. "All day gone without a trace, Stella-what were you up to?"


She answered promptly, her voice cold and steady, "I was in the research lab. Is there a problem? Honestly,the way you smell right now is making me feel sick."



Marc held her gaze, his expression unreadable.



She kept her composure, showing no trace of alarm.



Nothing in her expression betrayed a lie, and Marc,rubbing his forehead, finally let go of her arm. "Alright,then."






 Maybe he'd been overthinking things.


Stella slipped from his grasp and made her way upstairs to the study.







Across town, William lounged in the heart of the lively gathering, a glass of champagne balanced in his hand as he sank into the sofa, quietly surveying the room like an outsider.



Samuel Acosta, the head of a research lab, spotted William alone and wandered over, swirling his own wine. "Mr. Briggs, I heard you're handpicking people for the new project. I've been around the institute a long time-would you like me to introduce a few candidates?"


William regarded Samuel for a moment,then dipped his head in a slow nod. "Go ahead."



With an easy smile, Samuel launched into introductions, breezing through the first few team members with polished, bite-sized summaries.


The name "Stella Russell" seemed to flip a switch-suddenly,he was all enthusiasm.


"Mr. Briggs, Stella's the standout here-no contest.






She's picked up a shelf of awards since college, and her academic work pops up all over the web.Having her on the team is a real asset. She's the one behind that award-winning paper on biologically active factors."



William paused with his champagne halfway to his lips,caught off guard by the revelation.


He remembered the paper well-it had made waves across several fields, with results that spoke for themselves.


Back then, he'd scoured the journal, but the author's identity had been left out.


So she'd been the one to write it all along?


His mind wandered,recalling the unexpected softness of her touch earlier.


Maybe he'd gone too far in how he'd treated her today.



























###Chapter 26 Stop The Car!



Stella had been determined to earn her spot on the project teamn through her skills, not by relying on her looks to take an easier path.



When Samuel finished introducing everyone in the lab,William said nothing, but a subtle shift in his expression hinted at his change of mind.




...



The next morning arrived with golden sunlight spilling across the study. Stella stirred on the stiff bed,stretched,and checked her phone. There was a new assignment from the institute.



She quickly washed up and glanced at the dress she'd worn the night before, mentally noting to launder it before passing it along to Lainey.



By the time she reached the institute, William's assistant, Luca Chadwick, was already waiting. As the elevator doors slid open, he stepped forward to greet her.



"Good morning, Ms. Russell. I'm Mr. Briggs' assistant.You can call me Luca," he said with a warm tone. "The






project kicks off in five days, and we're forming groups so the team members can get familiar with each other. There's an opening to assist Mr. Briggs with document handling, and I think you'd be great at it."



Document handling?


Stella's brow furrowed faintly. Wasn't that usually an assistant's job or something a secretary handled?


Why offer her a task that didn't align with her field of study?


After pausing to consider, she asked, "Will I only be organizing documents, or are there additional responsibilities involved?"


Luca gave a reassuring smile. "You'll also support Mr.Briggs directly, helping him with whatever tasks come up."


That would mean spending more time around William.



Given how things had gone yesterday, she wasn't sure that was a good idea. Who knew what he might assume if she agreed?



So after a few seconds of thought, Stella politely declined. "Thanks, but I don't think this position suits me. I'd rather be assigned to another group with my



Luca was caught off guard.


The role was low-pressure, and working beside William came with advantages.


Most people would have accepted instantly, but Stella had declined.



"I really think this role matches your strengths, Ms.Russell. You could try it out, and if it's not working,we'll make a change," he said, hoping she'd reconsider.



Stella simply smiled and shook her head. "I appreciate it, but I'd prefer someone else take the role-someone better suited for it."


With that, she turned and walked off in the direction of the other workgroups.


Luca stood there,watching her retreat, completely at a loss.


As he stood there, unsure how to break the news to William, a tall silhouette drew near, voice low and commanding, "Is everything settled?"


Luca's shoulders slumped. "Mr. Briggs, Ms. Russell turned down the offer to join our group."





He braced himself for a scolding, lowering his gaze.But the harsh response never came.



Instead, William let out a quiet chuckle. "Smart girl."



Luca blinked, uncertain he'd heard correctly. "Mr.Briggs..."



"Forget it," William said casually, already walking away.



Luca remained baffled. But since William didn't seem bothered,he figured there was no reason to dwell on it either.



Meanwhile, Stella was knee-deep in project tasks with the rest of her team.



Breaks were rare, and time slipped by quickly.



With the official launch fast approaching,every detail had to be finalized, which only meant more work.



"Stella, we just wrapped up today's data. Can you drop it off with Mr. Briggs?" one of her teammates asked.



William held the final say on everything. Without his approval,nothing could move forward.Each team had to submit their data to him for review.



Though his looks were striking, his cold,unapproachable presence made everyone hesitant to
 deal with him. So, naturally, the responsibility landed on Stella.



Glancing around and seeing her teammates still occupied, Stella decided to go. But when she arrived at his office, he was nowhere to be found.



"He left? Where did he head off to?" she asked,brows furrowing.


"Yeah,but I think he's still heading to the underground parking garage. If you're quick, you'll catch him,"someone replied.



The files had to be reviewed today. Any delay would throw off tomorrow's schedule.



Stella didn't think twice. She turned around and raced toward the elevator.



Once outside, she stood at the institute's exit, as every car had to pass through here.


Moments later, William's sleek black Bentley rolled into view.



Stella stepped up to the curb and waved, hoping to flag it down.



But the vehicle kept moving.









Flustered, she realized she had no choice. The review was urgent. Taking a bold step forward, Stella planted herself right in front of the car.



























































###Chapter 27 To Disappear From His World



Tires shrieked across the pavement, the piercing sound slicing through the air.


William stomped on the brakes, rolled down his window,and scowled as he caught sight of Stella. "Are you courting death?" he barked, voice cold as steel.


Stella didn't waste a second on his temper. She strode right up to the window and thrust the stack of documents toward him. "Mr. Briggs, I just need a moment. These files require your immediate attention."



William's eyes flicked from her determined face to the documents in her grip. For a heartbeat, he said nothing -then hit the door release with a curt motion.



"Get in. I'm on a tight schedule. We'll go over them as we drive."



She hesitated,pressing her lips into a thin line, ready to protest. But something about his expression made her swallow the words. Instead,she circled the hood,pulled open the passenger door, and slid inside.


The car glided away from the research institute,its
engine humming quietly.


Neither of them noticed the watchful eyes fixed on them from a car parked just behind and to the right,watching every detail of their exchange.


Marc had just finished a meeting with a client and,by chance, drove past the research institute on his way back. To his surprise, he spotted Stella at the entrance,slipping into another man's car.


From where he sat, he watched Stella flash the man a bright, easy smile-a smile Marc couldn't remember her giving him in ages.


A storm gathered in Marc's expression as he reached for a cigarette and lit up, the flame trembling slightly in his hand.



He suddenly recalled the man from the bar the night before. Now that he looked closer, wasn't it the same guy?


Did that mean Stella had been with someone else these past two days?


The realization made him crush the cigarette between his fingers, embers snuffing out in his palm.


His feelings for Stella ran deep. Throughout their marriage, he'd done his best to give her everything she wanted.



Had his recent attention to Haley pushed Stella into someone else's arms?



Haley was just a fling to him, he would never replace Stella.But what was Stella doing here?


Fury flared-he slammed his fist onto the steering wheel, making the horn shriek through the enclosed car.



Stella belonged to him-no one else.


Inside the Bentley, Stella extended the documents toward William. "Mr. Briggs, my team and I prepared these documents for your review."


William arched an eyebrow, his gaze fixed on her for several lingering seconds, making sure she really was just talking business.


An amused smile curled at his lips. "I have to say,you're a lot more tempting now than when you tried to play innocent yesterday."



She definitely caught his eye-there was something about her that set her apart from the rest.



The word "tempting" rolled off his tongue, paired with the same charged look he'd given her that night.





A chill crept over Stella as she caught the strange glint in his eyes. "Mr. Briggs... I'll leave the documents with you. There's no need for me to stay. Could you let me out here?"



That unblinking stare unsettled her, and for a moment,she felt hunted.



William's eyebrow flicked upward, but he did as she asked, steering the car to the curb.


Stella wasted no time; she pushed open the door and slipped out.



William's car sped off without a backward glance.



She headed straight back to the office, burying herself in work.



That night, she returned home to an empty house,well aware Marc wouldn't be coming back.



If everything continued as planned, she didn't have much time left.



She craved nothing more than to vanish from Marc's world for good.



Glancing around the house, her eyes caught on small things she hadn't managed to clear out.






She'd already packed away whatever wasn't on display,but now she turned her attention to the last traces.



A stack of instant photos with Marc lingered on the shelf,along with a handful of souvenirs from old trips.


In recent days, the demands of the project had kept her too busy to dwell on these details.


But now, with her place on the project team secured and her schedule lighter, those forgotten bits resurfaced,impossible to ignore.


Fragments of her life with Marc drifted through her thoughts, sharp and bittersweet.


She reached for the pair of ceramic cups on the shelf,the ones they'd shaped together on vacation.



They'd never actually used the cups-just left them out as a reminder of a different time.



In those days, Marc's attention had belonged to her alone, his gaze never straying for anyone else.



On one of their trips, the two of them had caught a rare glimpse of a shooting star streaking across the night sky.



Stella could still recall the wish she'd whispered to herself back then-a simple hope that she and Marc




would always be happy together.


Now, as she remembered it, the memory felt almost laughable.



Her eyes landed on the pair of ceramic cups, and she let out a low, self-mocking chuckle.


People really did change, she realized, and now she finally understood how true that was.


With a tightness growing in her chest, Stella tore her gaze from those reminders of the past and began gathering them up, determined to throw them out.


Just as she started to pack everything away, the sound of the front door opening made her pause.











































###Chapter 28 Did He Find Out



When Stella glanced up, she found Marc standing in the door, dressed sharply in his usual suit.


She hesitated,momentarily thrown-he was home far earlier than she expected. Marc never left work this soon.



The timing couldn't have been worse,but Stella kept her calm, moving past him with her things cradled in her arms, her expression unreadable.


She banked on the hope that he'd be too distracted to pay her any mind.


Marc didn't even glance at what she was holding-he strode right over and caught her wrist without hesitation.



"Stella, I was planning to pick you up at the research institute today. I waited outside for ages, but you never showed. Did you leave by another exit?"



She coldly met his gaze, gently pulling her wrist free."I got a lift home with a colleague."



Marc fell silent, caught off guard by her answer. A colleague?






Had that man really been her colleague?


Marc scanned her face, hunting for the slightest flicker of guilt, but she gave him nothing.


Not a single tremor, not a quiver-she held herself with the composure of untouched water, completely inscrutable. However hard he stared, there wasn't a trace of dishonesty to be found.


With a soft laugh, Marc strode over and slipped an arm around her waist.



"You've put in so much effort, Stella. Now that things at the company are settled, I finally have a free week.What do you say we use this time to try for a baby?"


A frown pinched Stella's brow. Try for a baby? Was he serious?



She could've sworn she'd spelled it out for him last time, but Marc clearly hadn't let go of his obsession.



Her eyes iced over, voice sharp and distant. "Marc,I've already told you-l don't want a baby right now."



Just four more days and she'd be free of this manipulative man forever. The idea of starting a family with him felt laughable.





 think it'd be wonderful to have a baby? You always talked about wanting one before."



That word-before-made something flicker in Stella's eyes,her mouth curving into a cold half-smile.



She dropped the things she'd been carrying without a second thought, lifted her gaze, and fired off a question with cutting ease. "Marc, how are those condoms from Raskait working out for you? Bet they didn't disappoint."



Stella didn't hesitate to drag his secret into the light,bluntly naming the night he'd slunk away to meet Haley behind her back.



Marc's entire body went rigid. For a moment, he just stared at her, stunned silent.



He'd honestly believed she hadn't suspected a thing -until now, when he realized she'd known every detail and simply chosen not to say a word.



"Stella, wait-just let me explain..." Marc's voice trembled with desperation.



She had no patience left for any more excuses.Without looking back, Stella marched into the study,slammed the door behind her, and twisted the lock with a sharp click.







Marc pressed his fingers to his temples, groaning in exasperation,then stomped down the stairs and made his way into the kitchen.


He yanked open the cabinet and reached for the gas stove,flicking it on.


Whenever Stella shut him out, he'd head to the kitchen and whip up her favorite dishes-food had always been his go-to peace offering, and usually,she softened.


But tonight, he sensed it would take more than a home-cooked meal to win her over.


While getting the meal ready, his gaze darted around,and he realized the house felt strangely emptier than before.



He hadn't spent much time here lately, but he distinctly recalled Stella's prized capsule coffee maker always sitting on the counter. Now, a bare patch marked where it had been.



A knot formed in Marc's brow. He set the knife down and abandoned the half-prepared meal, taking the steps in a hurry.



"Stella, what happened to the capsule coffee maker?The one that was always in the kitchen?"









###Chapter 29 Keeping An Eye On Her



Stella faltered for a moment, caught off guard by his words. She'd left most of her belongings behind; the only sizable thing she'd carried out of the kitchen was the capsule coffee machine.


That machine had been her first big purchase since they'd become a couple, back when money was tight and she'd scraped together several months' pay to afford it.



Marc hardly ever set foot in the kitchen, so she never imagined he'd notice its absence.



Lost in her thoughts, she startled at the sound of Marc knocking again. "Stella, open up!"



If she delayed any longer, he'd start to suspect something-and the last thing she wanted was for him to realize other things had quietly vanished too.



She hurried to the door and pulled it open, matching his confused expression with a calm, steady gaze."The coffee machine stopped working, so I brought it out for repairs."






The machine had been around for years; it wasn't exactly a stretch for it to finally break down.


Marc's shoulders eased, the worry fading from his face as he accepted her explanation without another word.


Rather than letting her go, he caught her arm with a gentle touch. "Stella, I really messed up. Please, just give me another chance. Let me make your favorite meal-come downstairs and have a little with me?"


His easy, charming grin was as familiar as it was calculated.



Whenever she showed the slightest irritation, he would head into the kitchen and whip up something himself,pretending to bridge the gap with a homemade dish.


She used to find it endearing-this man,who wouldn't so much as set a plate on the table for anyone else,suddenly rolling up his sleeves just for her.



Now, she recognized it for what it was: another routine performance.


He had probably used the same trick on others before her.



She kept her tone calm and unbothered. "I'm not really hungry. I think I'll skip it."




Marc didn't lose his smile, still doing everything he could to stay in her good graces.


He asked, "Stella, what happened to that coat you got me a while back? I checked the closet yesterday,but it wasn't there."


Stella guessed he actually meant the one she'd picked out for William instead.



Every season, his closet overflowed with fresh deliveries; half the time, he couldn't recall what she'd given him.


His sudden interest struck her as odd, stirring a flicker of annoyance.


"I ended up getting the wrong size, so I sent it back,"she answered.


Marc looked genuinely taken aback. "Sent it back?Why not just swap it for another one if the fit was off?"



If she'd really meant to buy something for him,he doubted she would've returned it at all.



He hadn't examined the coat that day, but the logo on the shopping bag hadn't escaped his notice-a high-end label, unmistakably expensive.


Stella pressed her lips together, her tone mild. "Lately,




your whole look has shifted. I wasn't sure what you'd actually wear. Anyway, it's not like you're short on clothes-you've got tons already, don't you?"



Marc usually gravitated toward understated, classic pieces.


But his recent outfits had taken on a splash of color and flash Stella easily traced back to Haley.


Haley's taste was as loud as her personality-confident,eye-catching,never subtle.


More than once, Marc had come home in clothing Stella didn't recognize. Knowing Marc's aversion to shopping, she could only guess Haley had been slipping him these gifts.


He shook his head gently. "But you picked that coat out for me, Stella. Whatever you choose, I'll always like." Marc instantly sensed her hidden warning and tried to justify himself, his expression strained with anxiety.


Stella retreated a pace, her tone brisk. "I'm exhausted.I'm turning in for the night."



Without waiting for a response, she swung the door shut, refusing to spare Marc another glance and leaving him alone in the hallway, isolated and unwelcome.







Back at her desk, Stella dove into the project files,her attention fixed on the task at hand. Moments later,the rumble of an engine drifted in through the window.



She let out a quiet, knowing smile, having expected nothing less, and carried on reading without pause.


Unbeknownst to Stella, Marc didn't drive off immediately. He loitered by the curb for several minutes before sending out a message."Keep watch on her. I want updates on everything she does."

























































###Chapter 30 He Doesn't
Deserve It



The following morning, Stella tossed the trash bag away and began her quiet trek up the mountain.


Some years back, she and Marc had gone to the sacred tree to offer a wish for luck, leaving behind a wooden plaque inscribed with their hopes.


Marc had written with boyish certainty, "I want to marry Stella and cherish her forever."



She had laughed then remarking that only time could prove a promise like that-and by the time they'd know for sure, they'd both be old and worn,breathless from another climb to check if fate had listened.



Marc had wrapped his arms around her, smiling into her hair,saying a lifetime was exactly what he planned to give her. He'd spend every bit of it keeping that promise.



Standing beneath the wishing tree as light rain fell,Stella quietly searched for the plaque she and Marc had once left behind.








With the divorce underway, the plaque meant nothing to her now. She couldn't stand the thought of it still hanging there, silently asking for blessings on something already broken.


To her, Marc wasn't worthy of it. Neither was the relationship they'd let fall apart.


She searched carefully, sifting through countless nearly identical plaques, and finally spotted theirs.


The red string dangled loosely from the branch,and Stella couldn't help but think it might've fallen on its own if she hadn't shown up today.


The ink had faded, the writing barely legible, bout Stella didn't hesitate. She tossed it into the nearest trash bin.



In its place, she bought a new plaque.



This time, she wrote her own message-just for herself-and tied it to the tree.



From now on, she would be her own reason to keep going.



As the plaque swayed gently in the breeze, the rain felt lighter, almost comforting.



Heading back down the mountain, the rain began to pour harder. She stopped at a roadside shop,picked




up a cheap umbrella, and continued walking slowly.


Unseen in the shadows, someone quietly snapped her photo. After studying it for a few seconds,they sent it straight to Marc.







Inside the Walsh Group office, Marc sat behind his desk as Haley crossed her legs, her high heel brushing lightly against his leg. "Marc, how long are you going to stare at that screen? Look at me for once."



His frustration simmered just beneath the surface.



Stella had been increasingly difficult to predict, and now she was outright refusing to renew her contract.With the patent agreement already expired, her decision threatened to cause serious financial damage for the company.


Since Haley joined the legal department, several collaborations had fallen apart. She couldn't manage the responsibilities, struggling with even the basics,and the department was now in near-complete disorder.



Despite being the root of the chaos, Haley acted as if nothing was wrong.



Marc clenched his jaw, forcing down his irritation as he studied the documents in front of him, his expression turning stormy.


Haley, pretending not to notice, shot a disdainful glance at the unsigned contract. "Stella's being impossible. Why won't she just sign? Does she really think we're powerless? If she walks away,we'll find someone else!"



Her clueless rant grated on him. Marc shut his eyes for a moment, massaging his temples, trying to keep his temper in check.


Then his phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen-and froze. It was a photo of Stella, striking and serene even in the rain. Instantly, he forgot about Haley.



No matter how many women came and went, only Stella had the power to unsettle him like this.



His gaze darkened.



"Leave," he said flatly.













###Chapter 31 Trash From
Abroad Is Still Trash



Haley was caught off guard. She didn't understand why Marc wanted her out. Still, she stood her ground."I'm staying. Unless there's something you're hiding from me?"



Marc shot her a bored look, not interested in arguing.Instead of replying, he turned his attention to a new message on his phone. It said Stella had gone up the mountain about an hour earlier and had lingered by the wish tree, apparently writing something again.



He instantly recognized the location. They'd been there together once. But why was she replacing her plaque now?



His thoughts tangled into a knot.



Something didn't sit right, but he couldn't put his finger on it.


The only option that made sense to him was tracking down Stella and figuring out what was really going on.


He stood abruptly, snatched his coat from the rack,and headed for the door.



Before stepping out, he picked up the office landline and contacted the legal department, instructing them to revise the contracts.



He spoke loud enough for Haley to hear, and the message hit its mark-her face flushed with embarrassment. Seeing Marc heading for the door without a second glance only fueled her irritation.



"Marc, where are you going? What's wrong with the contracts? Did I mess something up?" She reached out,trying to stop him, arms spread to block the door.


Marc walked right past her without acknowledging her presence.


"Marc!" she called after him, glaring as his figure disappeared down the hall. She stomped her foot,furious. He didn't even pause. He was completely ignoring her!


Moments later, the head of legal arrived,informed by colleagues that Marc had called. He took one look at Haley's stormy expression and silently grabbed the documents from her desk, choosing not to say a word.



Haley,still fuming, chased after him. "Hold on! I spent hours on those contracts! Why are you taking them back? You're nothing but a useless leech!"






The supervisor looked fed up. He hadn't even pointed out how disorganized and unusable the contracts were,yet Haley was already bragging about how carefully she had prepared them. How clueless could she be?



Saying nothing, the supervisor simply observed as Haley's eyes darted around the roomn until they locked onto Allegra.



Haley suddenly recalled that Allegra had some sort of connection to Stella. "You! Yes, you! Aren't you in legal? Didn't you see the effort I poured into those contracts? You just sit there like a statue while I do all the real work. What does this company even pay you for-decoration? People like you are dragging us down. Effectve immediately, forget about getting a year-end bonus."



Everyone knew Haley was out to provoke someone.


Allegra slowly rose from her seat and walked over,her expression unreadable.


She had always been quiet, someone who kept her head down to keep her position. But things had shifted.


After talking with Stella, she realized there was no point enduring a dead-end job just to say she had one.


A fancy office meant nothing if the one running it had





 no clue what they were doing. With a boss like that,her future would be stuck in place.



"Ms. Smith," she began calmly, "have you actually looked at those 'contracts' you're so proud of? They don't even follow the company's basic formatting standards. You call that detailed work? It's laughable.Everyone knows you're from the Smith family but who would've guessed your abilities would be this embarrassing? Honestly, a kid with half a brain could've done better."



The room went silent. People stared at Allegra like they were seeing her for the first time. She'd always kept her voice low. Where had this version of her come from?



"You! Who do you think you are, talking to me like that? I'll have Marc fire you on the spot!"


But Allegra only chuckled. "Too late. My resignation's already been submitted. If you're hoping to kick me out,you've missed your chance. And since we're being honest,I can't stomach people who climb with favors and destroy families in the process. You tick both boxes. Also-newsflash-waving your foreign passport around doesn't make you special. Trash from abroad is still trash."







###Chapter 32 She Was Not On The List!



Haley's reputation had already crashed and burned in front of the entire company, so not a single person dared to stick up for her. The crowd just watched,eager to witness her downfall.


She hissed, "You're nothing but a shameless witch-who gave you the right to talk to me like that?"


Rage twisted Haley's features, her face flushing a furious crimson. Even the lowest-ranking employees were emboldened to stand up to her now.


Allegra shot back. "Didn't you go to college? Try acting like it, instead of hurling insults and making a spectacle of yourself. Anyway, I'm not on the payroll anymore,so cut my/year-end bonus if it makes you happy!"



Having delivered her parting shot, Allegra saw.no point in staying another second.


Letting her resentment spill out in front of everyone felt like a small,hard-won victory.



Without sparing Haley another glance, Allegra
scooped up her things and strode out of the office building, chin lifted in quiet defiance.


Outside, the air tasted sharper, as if the whole world had been scrubbed clean.



"Did you see Allegra just now? Who knew she had that kind of nerve!"



"She got pushed too far. Some folks think their title gives them a free pass, but all they do is dig their own grave."


Their colleagues' biting comments drifted over,setting Haley's teeth on edge. She let out a shriek that rattled the windows. "Ugh! You clueless idiots-just wait until Marc gets back! I'll make sure every single one of you is out on the street!"



No one bothered to argue. They traded knowing glances and quietly slipped back into their work routines,refusing to feed into Haley's meltdown.



If Marc actually intended to let them go, there were still procedures to follow. They had nothing to fear.



As they sat at their desks, a creeping thought took hold-maybe Allegra had made the wisest move after all.



The chaos Haley had unleashed had already left the






company in shambles, and no one could say how much worse things might get.



It was probably time for everyone to start thinking about their own next steps.



After leaving the mountain, Stella headed directly to the research institute.



She'd risen before sunrise to climb the mountain,but still made it to the institute right on schedule.


As the project deadline loomed, Stella planted herself at the institute, buried in research from sunrise to nightfall-she hadn't stepped foot in the villa for days.



Lainey watched Stella bury herself in research,worry etched across her face. "You can't keep running yourself into the ground like this. What if you faint?"


A gentle smile tugged at Stella's lips. "I appreciate it,Lainey. Trust me, I know my limits."


Lainey could only sigh, resigning herself to Stella's stubborn streak. "Hey, Stella, the list just came out!Come on, let's take a look. You could use a little breather."



A jolt of anxiety shot through Stella as she pushed herself to her feet and hurried over to the newly posted sheet.


Her eyes darted from the first name to the last,combing through each line with mounting tension.But her name was nowhere to be found.



A cold heaviness pressed down on her chest. Maybe she'd skimmed past it? She started again from the top,scanning every letter as if willing her name to appear.


Even after committing every name to memory,the result was the same-hers simply wasn't there.


Blinking in disbelief, Stella turned to meet Lainey's gaze, only to find her friend looking just as shocked and lost.Had she really not made it?











###Chapter 33 Settled On
Another Plan



Stella couldn't remember how she made it back to her desk. The low drone in her ears swallowed every other sound, blurring the world around her like she'd slipped underwater.



Lainey,hovering nearby, took in Stella's vacant stare and recognized the bruised look of disappointment.Without a word, she placed a comforting hand on Stella's shoulder and rubbed her back in slow,gentle circles.



"Hey, it's all right," she murmured, her tone soothing but tinged with concern. "There'll be more research projects coming up soon. Missing out on this one isn't the end of the world."



Lainey's worried voice finally pierced the fog.



Stella blinked, the office lights suddenly too bright,and managed a crooked, defeated smile. "I'm fine,really."



"You sure?" Lainey's brow furrowed, unconvinced."You don't look fine."



Stella inhaled shakily, steadying herself with a few deep breaths. "Honestly, I'm okay. Don't fuss over me,Lainey. Go take care of your own work."


She gave Lainey a nudge, forcing her away with a small, grateful glance, then slumped into her chair,numb and silent.


She'd pinned so much hope on this project-believing it would finally cut the last thread tying her to Marc.But after everything,maybe those misunderstandings had sealed her fate from the start. William had never intended to put her on the team.



Now, staring at her blank screen, a heavier question pressed in. How was she supposed to deal with the looming divorce?



Stella massaged her aching temples, pushing herself to come up with a new plan.



The divorce agreement-her so-called "gift" to Marc -had been handed over long ago.



If she couldn't join the project team, so be it. Maybe this was her cue to step back and disappear for a while.



After all, the marriage was already finished;nothing about the project would change that fact.

With that realization, some of the pressure in her chest finally loosened.



She reminded herself, over and over,that problems always had a workaround, no matter how bleak things looked.



Clutching her cup, Stella wandered toward the break room. She nearly collided with Luca, who'd dropped by the institute for work.



One glance at her expression and he immediately pieced it together-she'd seen the team roster.


"Ms. Russell," Luca called out, concern flickering in his eyes. "Try not to let the list get to you."



Stella caught on belatedly-Luca was trying, in his awkward way, to cheer her up. The attempt struck her as almost endearing. A hint of a smirk played on her lips. "Luca, you really have no talent for comforting people,you know that?"



He looked flustered, searching for a comeback and coming up empty. After a brief silence, he shifted gears. "Mr. Briggs is hosting a dinner at the Voyage Hotel tonight. If you're not busy, Ms. Russell, maybe you should come along. It might give him a chance to reconsider."










Stella's eyes flickered with surprise at his odd invitation. She found it strange-Luca, of all people,was supposed to know every detail of William's plans,maybe even help shape them behind the scenes.


If William had truly made up his mind to exclude her,what was the point in showing up and begging for a spot?



Anyone else might've offered that advice, but coming from Luca,it rang hollow.



She set her jaw, her expression resolute. "That won't be necessary. Mr. Briggs must have his reasons. I'm sure he's found someone better suited for the team."



Without waiting for a reply, Stella turned and walked off,her cup in hand, heading for the break room and leaving Luca standing in the hallway,looking slightly defeated.



He was trapped-caught between loyalty to William and his belief in Stella's talent, knowing that losing her would be the team's loss.



While refilling her cup, Stella mustered a brittle,practiced smile.



Now that William had made his choice, she saw no reason to linger in his orbit.
Their connection had always revolved around the project, and with that door closed, she felt no urge to chase after a man so clearly indifferent.


There was no use clinging to someone who barely acknowledged her existence.



Back at her desk, the finalized team list gave her an unfamiliar stretch of free time. Stella propped her phone against her notebook, thumbing through flight options out of Choria. Each new city she scrolled past felt like a lifeline tossed into deep water.



Marc would discover the divorce agreement sooner or later, and knowing him, he'd move heaven and earth to hunt her down. If she stayed in Choria, escape would be impossible-Marc's persistence was as relentless as ever.



But the world outside Choria was wide.



Marc's attention was tangled up with Haley now, and he wouldn't waste much effort tracking her if she vanished completely from his radar.



The farther she fled, the safer she'd be!






###Chapter 34 She's Not That Fragile



After weighing everything, Stella made up her mind to apply for leave from the research institute.



Her supervisor did't question her request and signed off on it right away.


When Lainey found out, she walked over and asked,"Stella, is this about the project team list?"



She could tell Stella had been deeply invested in that assignment.


Stella didn't explain, just offered a faint smile. It was the kind of look adults exchanged when words weren't necessary, and Lainey didn't push for more.



"You've been going nonstop lately," Lainey added. "A break might do you good." She'd noticed how Stella barely gave herself a moment to breathe.



Stella was always among the first to arrive and often the last to leave. There were even nights she stayed at the institute.



No one there worked with as much intensity.

After leaving the building, Stella stood near the road,trying to flag down a taxi. She intended to collect the last of her things fromn Marc's villa.


At that moment, a black sedan pulled out of the garage.Luca was behind the wheel, and William sat in the backseat, eyes fixed on a file.


Luca quickly spotted her.


With her striking features and tall frame, she wasn't easy to overlook.


"Mr.Briggs, that's Ms. Russell," he said. "Should we let her know the truth about the team selection? She didn't seem okay today." Luca spoke plainly, he knew she'd asked for extended leave.



Why elsewould she leave so suddenly if she weren't upset?



But William stayed quiet.


Through the car window, Stella caught a glimpse of William, and her chest tightened. She turned quickly and walked off, putting space between herself and the vehicle.



Luca blinked in surprise. Was she deliberately avoiding them?







William noticed as well. The way she hurried off felt more like she was escaping than simply walking away.


His jaw tightened slightly, and his mood shifted.



Back when she was eager to be part of the project team, she had gone out of her way to stay close. But now that the list had been announced, she didn't even try to hide her distance?


A quiet, humorless chuckle escaped him. "It's fine.She's not the delicate type."



Then,he motioned to Luca to drive away.


The car rolled past her, tires kicking up dust in its wake.



Only when the vehicle had vanished from sight did Stella finally exhale.


Something about William set off too many alarms in her-it felt safer to keep their contact strictly professional.







Elsewhere, Marc had noticed Stella hadn't come home in days.



Knowing how committed she was to her position at the institute, he decided to spend the nights with Haley instead.


By the sixth day without any sign of Stella at the villa,Marc grew increasingly unsettled.


He called her, again and again, but her line never connected.


She had blocked his number, that much was obvious.



He stared at the screen in stunned silence, struggling to believe it. Stella had actually shut him out.


A strange panic stirred in his chest, creeping in slowly until he was completely uneasy.



In the days that followed, he began waiting near the institute, hoping to catch a glimpse of where she went when she didn't return home.


But each time, he left disappointed, not once had he seen her.


Today,though,he arrived earlier than usual. Just as he was beginning to think the wait would end in vain again,he finally spotted Stella walking out. Just as he was ready to drive over, something caught his attention. A familiar black sedan rolled out of the garage.



He slammed the brake, killed the engine, and leaned
back,eyes locked on the car.


That was the same one she had entered before-he was sure of it.
###Chapter 35 Ask Her Why She Doesn't Go Home



Previously, when Marc's suspicions were first roused,he'd immediately sent someone to trace the license plate, only to discover it belonged to William Briggs.That single fact gnawed at him-how on earth could Stella have any sort of tie to someone like William Briggs?


Marc was well aware of William's influence in Choria.Men of William's caliber never lacked for female attention, and Stella was just a commoner. There was no logical reason for a man like William to set his sights on her.


Unless... there was some hidden connection,something Marc hadn't yet uncovered.


Lately, he couldn't ignore how Stella had grown increasingly withdrawn, slipping further and further from his grasp. Was her distance because of William?Or was something else pulling her away?


Stella had just slipped free of William's orbit and was heading for the curb to hail a cab, relief only beginning to settle, when her gaze snagged on a
familiar car idling across the street.


A jolt of anxiety shot through her veins. The vehicle's headlights flashed, and in the next moment,it swung into a tight turn and pulled up right in front of her.


Marc's door flew open. He climbed out, straightened his jacket, and met her stunned eyes with a look she couldn't read.


He planted himself in her path, his tone low but edged with accusation. "Stella, why haven't you come home these past few days?"


Stella couldn't help but taste the sting of irony when Marc still called that place "home."


"I've just had a lot going on," she replied, looking away as she fumbled for an excuse.


This time, Marc wasn't so easily dismissed. He pressed her, his tone unyielding. "So being busy means you have to clear out all your things? Half the house is empty,Stella-and everything missing belongs to you."


He fixed his eyes on her, silently demanding an answer.


Caught off guard, Stella felt a helpless frustration rising inside her. If she'd been able to join the project team, maybe she wouldn't have to stand here facing
Marc, struggling to invent explanations.


As she faltered for words, Marc closed the distance between them. "You even blocked my number. And the wedding photo-it's gone. Where did you put everything,Stella?"


A faint, mocking smile tugged at Stella's lips. So he'd finally realized the wedding photo was missing?


After all this time, he'd barely noticed-typical Marc.


She drew a steadying breath, then lifted her chin to meet his stare. "I ran into a little financial trouble, so l pawned my things. Once I've sorted things out,I'll get them back. As for the wedding photo, the frame was damaged, so I took it to have it restored."


Stella offered no explanation for blocking Marc,silently willing her earlier excuse to be enough.



Marc didn't press her about it-just as she'd hoped-but his brow knitted with concern. "If you needed money, why didn't you just tell me? There was no reason to pawn your things," he said, his tone equal parts reprimand and disbelief.



The items he'd given her were barely worth anything at a pawn shop-just trinkets compared to what he could provide.
Without another word, Marc slid several bank cards into Stella's palm, his voice taking on that familiar,transactional warmth. "Take these. Use them for whatever you want."


Whenever trouble flared between them,Marc always tried to smooth things over with cash.


In the early days of their marriage, he'd delighted in showering Stella with expensive gifts-luxury handbags,rare jewelry,anything with a hefty price tag.



He'd handed her more than one card with no spending limit, as if money could buy her contentment.


Even then, she'd barely touched them,leaving the cards to collect dust in a bedside drawer.



Now, with divorce looming over them, she had even less reason to accept his generosity.


Before he could pull his hand back, she brushed it aside with a firm shake of her head. "That's not necessary. I've already sorted the money myself.You can keep those cards."



Marc hesitated, caught off guard by her refusal. He caught a flash of chill and barely veiled impatience in her eyes. Almost reflexively, he reached out and caught her wrist, his grip tightening as if he could
anchor her with words. "Stella, what are you hiding from me?"



His voice dropped, roughened by frustration. "We're still husband and wife. No matter what's going on-good or bad-you can tell me. I'll handle it with you.You don't have to shoulder everything alone."



If she hadn't known he was wwhispering the same empty reassurances to Haley behind her back, maybe she'd have fallen for his act again.


Instead, Stella forced a thin, unbothered smile."There's nothing to tell. Work's been busy at the institute, and I have a business trip coming up. I'll be out of town for a while."


With that, she gently pried his fingers off her wrist and turned to leave.


Marc's voice cut through the air, tense and insistent."Wait!"
###Chapter 36 A Stalker Was Lower Than The Scum



Marc barely got a word out before Stella breezed right past him, raising her arm to wave over a cab as if he didn't even exist.


Once inside the taxi, she rattled off an address to the driver, her voice low and steady. The engine rumbled to life, but Stella barely registered it-her attention was fixed on her lap as she rifled through her plane ticket and travel documents, mentally double-checking what she might have forgotten for her upcoming trip.


Now that Marc was finally suspicious, there was no way she'd risk heading back to the villa to grab anything she'd left behind. She'd have to make do with what she had.


The car took a sharp turn. Stella lifted her gaze just in time to catch Marc's car lurking in the rearview mirror.A tight frown pinched her features. So, he'd decided to tail her after all.

Without missing a beat, she leaned forward and quietly gave the driver a new destination.
If Marc wanted to follow her that badly, she'd make sure he kept chasing.


The taxi pulled up to a crowded shopping mall. Stella settled the fare and stepped out,melting seamlessly into the press of shoppers.



After a few paces, she spotted Marc's unmistakable figure weaving toward her from behind.


Amusement flickered across her face. She kept her stride relaxed, feigning oblivion as she slipped into her usual cafe.



Once inside, Stella marched directly toward the restroom, barely glancing at the bustling cafe around her.



Marc trailed after her, but by thetime he reached the hallway,he caught onlya glimpse of her vanishing into the restroom.



He hesitated outside, the tension in his shoulders giving him away.


Stella had deliberately picked this cafe,knowing its restroom opened directly into the mall outside.


An escape route waited just beyond the window.


No ordinary customer would ever risk crawling out,
especially with security cameras covering every corner-anyone who tried would be caught in minutes.



But because of this, the management had never bothered to board up the window, leaving Stella a perfect loophole.


With quick, practiced movements, she hoisted herself onto the ledge, slung her bag over her shoulder, and slipped through the opening. She landed lightly on the pavement outside, barely making a sound.



Just as she straightened up, she found herself nearly nose-to-nose with a cleaning lady hauling a trash bag toward the dumpster.



The cleaning lady blinked at her in confusion, clearly startled to see someone emerge from a restroom window.



Stella flashed a polite smile-and in that instant, a bold plan sparked in her mind.



Flashing a quick, earnest smile, she beckoned the cleaning lady over. "Ma'am, if you help me out,I'll give you five hundred dollars. When you head back in,just dump the water from your bucket onto the man waiting outside the restroom."



Baffled, the cleaning lady eyed the bills Stella held out, uncertainty etched across her face.

Leaning in, Stella dropped her voice in a hushed tone."He's been following me since I left home. I'm desperate. Please, if you can pull this off, the money's yours-minus the price of a coffee, if you want one."


The lady's eyes flickered with hesitation, but the weight of her own troubles-an ailing daughter and bills piling up-lingered behind her silence.Finally,she accepted the cash with a quiet nod.


"Please, don't let him know I'm gone. And thank you -really," Stella said, warmth and relief mingling inher tone as she turned away, not sparing another glance for Marc or whatever chaos would follow.



Back inside the cafe, the cleaning lady gripped the heavy bucket, sloshing with cloudy water from her morning rounds.



Carrying out Stella's instructions, the cleaning lady made her way to the utility sink, acting as if she hadn't noticed Marc crouched sullenly by the tiled wall.Without hesitation, she flipped the entire bucket over his head, sending a foul wave of murky water splashing down.



"Serves you right, you creep," she thought, her eyes flashing with indignation. "You might look respectable,but you're just a two-bit stalker."








"What the hell are you doing?!" Marc bellowed,scrambling to his feet, filthy water dripping from his soaked hair and splattered suit.



His expression darkened to a murderous red.


Feigning shock, the cleaning lady/pressed a hand to her chest. "Oh my goodness, sir, I'm so sorry! I didn't see you standing there. I thought you were just...part of the plumbing. Please forgive me! Should I compensate you somehow?"


To her, astalker was lower than the scum she scrubbed from the restroom drains.



She yanked out an old rag-the one she reserved for the dirtiest jobs-and, with forced enthusiasm,started dabbing at Marc's sleeve.


The rag reeked of bleach and toilet grime. With exaggerated clumsiness, she smeared it across his cheeks, then, as if by accident, slapped the filthy cloth right across his mouth, muffling his protests and smearing him with even more filth.

###Chapter 37 Rant And Rave



"Ugh!" Marc bent over as a wave of nausea swept through him, his gut twisting from the stench clinging to his soaked clothes.



The cleaning lady jumped back in alarm, her apologies tumbling out in a flustered rush.


Marc clenched his jaw, knowing that exploding at her here would only make him look even more pathetic.


He stood there shivering, the icy,foul-smelling water seeping through every layer and sticking to his skin.


Still, when his gaze drifted toward the restroom, his pride refused to let him retreat. With a sharp flick of his wrist, he shook off the cleaning lady's hand and snapped, "Enough! Just go-don't bother me!"


The cleaning lady blinked in surprise at his outburst.Taking in his pitiful state and stubborn refusal to leave,she silently concluded he really was a stalker.


At least that poor woman had managed to get away from him.



Having fulfilled her end of the deal, the cleaning lady hurried off, eager to put the bizarre scene behind her.


Marc, left standing in a puddle of humiliation,



 awkwardly dabbed at his ruined shirt, his anger simmering just beneath the surface. Still, he stubbornly refused to budge.


Did Stella really think a cheap stunt like that would get rid of him? Not a chance.


There was no way he'd believe Stella would actually hole up in a restroom all day just to avoid him.






Stepping out of the bustling mall, Stella finally breathed easier.


She hadn't witnessed Marc's humiliation herself,but the mere thought of his uptight, obsessive self splattered with dirty water was more than enough to lift her mood.


Marc, of all people, loathed mess. The idea of him reeking and sticky, frantically scrubbing himself clean,almost made her laugh out loud.


She headed for the curb, hand half-raised to flag down a taxi,when her phone buzzed deep in her purse.Pulling it out, Stella hesitated-an unfamiliar number flashed across the screen, but something about it made her skin prickle with recognition.


She answered warily."Hello?"


A honeyed but sharp voice immediately cut in, all

. .



going to keep pestering Marc? He's finished with you.Why don't you have a little dignity and let go?"


Haley's words dripped with mockery, her supposed language barrier nowhere to be found. The performance was so ridiculous, Stella almost snorted.


A steely glint flickered in Stella's eyes as she answeed,her tone icy and unhurried, "Maybe you need a reminder-Marc and I are still married, whether or not love is involved. The law's on my side. So tell me-who said you could call me up and start hurling accusations?"


Haley's lips parted, but nothing came out. For several seconds, she stood frozen, speechless. "I'm not here to fight with you. Why don't you come over so we can talk face-to-face? It's simple-the one who isn't loved is always the third wheel. Take my advice and know your place."


A cold laugh slipped from Stella, mocking and sharp."Haley,is this really what the Smith family taught you?To meddle in other people's marriages and play the mistress? I guess when you're completely shameless,there's nothing left to lose. It's almost admirable,how you can spout this nonsense without a single scrap of dignity or self-awareness."


Haley's face twisted with fury. "You'd better watch your mouth!"


Stella arched an evehrow thorouahlv uinimnressed
Did Haley honestly think she could intimidate her?


"I've got better things to do than play along with your bullshit. Maybe try focusing on the Walsh Group's plummeting profits instead of pestering me."


Stella's finger hovered over the screen, ready to end the call, when a cold, familiar voice cut in from the other end of the line, "Stella, how could you speak to Haley like that?"


It was Jazlyn-Marc's mother.


A thin smile curled on Stella's lips. No wonder Haley sounded so bold. Clearly, she had Jazlyn backing her,ready to swoop in at a moment's notice.


Jazlyn had never bothered to hide her disdain for Stella. From the beginning, she'd seen Stella as a nobody, someone with no useful connections, no value to offer the Walsh family.


Now, with Haley in the picture, Jazlyn acted like a shameless flatterer, siding with anyone she thought could benefit her precious son.



"You'd better show up right now," Jazlyn snapped,her voice laced with threat. "Let me make this clear, Stella -clinging to my son will get you nowhere. You're nothing but a burden to our family. If you have any sense left, you'll come to the Voyage Hotel immediately. If not, you can face the consequences."

Stella hadn't planned on indulging their drama, but at those words, her expression tightened. After a beat of hesitation, she set her jaw and changed course.







###Chapter 38 Draw A Clean Line



Stella had been waiting for a chance to draw a clean line with her former mother-in-law and to let Jazlyn know she intended to reclaim everything that rightfully belonged to her-possessions Jazlyn would soon have to relinquish.



As the silence stretched, Jazlyn's sharp voice continued grating through the phone. "Are you deaf?Didn't you hear a word I said? Is this how you treat your elders? No wonder you lost my son!"


The barrage of accusations yanked Stella out of her thoughts, flooding her with irritation.


During her marriage, she'd endured Jazlyn's endless nitpicking with practiced patience, never once losing her composure, even before learning the truth about Marc and Haley.



But years of civility had gotten her nowhere.


Instead, Jazlyn had only grown more arrogant, using every chance to belittle her.


Now,with everything unraveling, Stella saw no point in


 pretending any longer. Someone as petty as Jazlyn deserved to be put in her place.


"Fine," Stella replied, her tone cool and unbothered."I'll be there."



Jazlyn's mouth was already open, ready to launch another tirade, when Stella's sudden agreement caught her off guard. For a split second, Jazlyn faltered, blinking in surprise, but she quickly recovered her domineering air.



"You'd better show up," she snapped. "You have half an hour. If you're late, I'll make Marc divorce you on the spot-and don't expect to see a single cent from the settlement!"



The threat almost made Stella laugh out loud. As if she had any interest in Marc's pitiful fortune.



He was the one chasing after her now, desperate to buy back the patent she owned.



After the call ended, Stella flagged down a taxi and headed straight for the Voyage Hotel.



Inside, it didn't take her long to spot Haley and Jazlyn together.



They sat side by side, putting on a show of solidarity and warmth, like two actresses playing the role of a



loving family.


Jazlyn's eyes flashed the moment she saw Stella walk in. Without hesitation, she slammed her palm onto the table, sending a jolt through the cutlery.


"So,you finally bothered to show up. I want you to divorce my son, right here, right now. Tell me, after all these years of marriage, what have you ever done for the Walsh family? You can't even give us a child.Absolutely useless. No place in this family for a barren hen like you!"


Her words stung, each one meant to cut deeper than the last.


But Stella barely flinched. She'd lost count of how many times Jazlyn had spat out the same vicious remarks over the years.


Haley lounged next to Jazlyn, an unmistakable look of satisfaction playing at the corners of her mouth. "Her family's nothing-lost her parents young, raised without manners. You really shouldn't lower yourself,Jazlyn."


Jazlyn, emboldened by Haley's support, banged her fist against the table. "Get those divorce papers ready by Monday. I refuse to tolerate you in my family for one more day!"



Now that Haley had worked her influence, Jazlyn truly believed she deserved a daughter-in-law like Haley -someone polished and pedigreed, not a nobody like Stella getting in Marc's way.


Haley braced herself,half-expecting a fight,but Stella merely nodded, calm and unflinching. "Fine. I'll divorce him."



The answer blindsided both of them.



Their eyes locked, equally shocked by Stella's ready surrender.


Catching the chill in Stella's smile, Haley stayed composed, clasped Jazlyn's hand, and pressed. "Stella,what do you want out of this?"


With a sidelong glance, Stella's gaze lingered on Haley, recognizing a glimmer of shrewdness absent in Jazlyn.


"I'm not making any demands. Divorce is perfectly fine by me. But, Jazlyn, I expect you to pay back every cent I spent on your endless beauty appointments and imported supplements. And as for the casino? I hope you enjoyed your last visit,because you won't be stepping foot in there again."


Jazlyn had clawed her way through a harsh youth,and




once Marc's fortunes soared, she wasted no time plunging into a life of extravagance.



She reveled in every indulgence-her weeks filled with pampering sessions at upscale salons and rare imported supplements lined up on her vanity.


She also had a taste for gambling, though she was hardly discreet about it. Bad luck dogged her at every turn, and when her losses piled up, so did her foul temper-her sharp tongue echoing through the casino until someone dragged her away. If not for Stella's discreet intervention, the casino staff would have barred her years ago.


Now, hearing Stella's cool demands, Jazlyn's face twisted with fury.


She saw straight through the act-Stella was stalling.


Clearly, she had no real intention of letting go and dared to bargain as if she still held any cards.


"Stella, don't you dare get greedy with me. Why should I pay you back a cent?" Jazlyn snapped, her voice dripping with indignation. "Those supplements?My son paid for them. As for the salon visits, I cover those with my own membership."


Haley interjected, her tone sharp and mocking, "Stella,honestly, isn't this a little beneath you? Or could it be

 you're not actually ready for this divorce-and you're just making excuses to keep Jazlyn on a leash?"






###Chapter 39 Stella Would Face The Consequences


Stella glanced at the pair and let out a bright,unrestrained laugh. "I'm just laying out the truth here.That membership card you're so fond of? My friend owns the salon-I got you a ninety percent discount.The health supplements you're taking every month-why not ask Marc who's really footing the bill? And everyone at the casino knows exactly how many toes you've stepped on."


All those perks Jazlyn enjoyed had never meant anything to Stella before.



Just the monthly supplements alone added up to a hefty sum, but Stella had never gone to Marc for a single cent-she'd always covered the cost herself.


Now that the divorce was underway,she saw no reason not to reclaim every last bit, plus interest.


Jazlyn's expression soured with each word.


She might have outranked Stella socially,but Stella wasn't known for spinning stories.


Jazlyn was thoroughly used to her regular beauty




appointments, and	those	supplements	felt indispensable. If she lost access to either,her body would almost certainly show it.


The thought left Jazlyn uncertain, her gaze dropping for a moment.


Those perks were nothing if not real.


Haley, picking up on her hesitation, felt a rush of nerves. She clutched Jazlyn's hand and blurted,"Please, Mrs. Walsh, don't worry. From now on, I'll make sure you have everything you need. Your standard of living won't drop, I swear! Supplements,salon treatments-I have plenty of connections. I'll handle it all."



Stella caught the desperate edge in Haley's voice and fought the urge to roll her eyes.



Everything she'd named so far barely scratched the surface.


Jazlyn's condition was fragile, and ordinary supplements weren't enough-she relied on an elusive remedy that couldn't be bought, no matter how deep your pockets were.



Stella herself had once flown overseas and spent more than two weeks tracking it down.




Jazlyn cared deeply about appearances and chased after every opportunity to climb the social ladder.


After Stella married Marc, she'd gone out of her way to secure Jazlyn a prestigious-if mostly ceremonial -professor title at a university.


That title had opened countless doors for Jazlyn.


At every school function, she could step onto the stage, soaking in the admiration that fed her pride year after year.


But now, with Stella out of the picture, the university would almost certainly strip her of that honor.


Haley might grit her teeth and try to pull strings, but as the heiress of the Smith family, would she really go that far for Jazlyn's sake?



That seemed highly unlikely.


If she refused to comply, Jazlyn would kick up a storm,dragging the entire Walsh family into chaos.


With that thought, Stella found herself almost anticipating the spectacle.


Haley, oblivious to the amusement flickering in Stella's eyes, poured all her effort into manipulating Jazlyn, urging her to pressure Stella and Marc into

splitting up.


Jazlyn's patience finally snapped. She jabbed a finger in Stella's direction, voice quivering with frustration."Fine. If you claim all that's gone, then so be it. But l want you to divorce my son-right now!"


Stella just gave a weary shake of her head. Predictably,Haley only needed to prod a little to get Jazlyn riled up.


Settling back against the armchair, Stella studied the two women facing her, their postures stiff with self-importance. "Alright. But a divorce requires both parties to show up. If you can get Marc here, I won't stand in your way."


She'd expected some grand ultimatum, but this was all they had-just another ploy to make her file the divorce first.



What a pointless waste of time.



Neither Jazlyn nor Haley could come up with a response.



They were painfully aware that Marc refused to even discuss divorce-if he hadn't, they wouldn't have dragged Stella out here in secret.



Jazlyn's temper snapped. "I'm Marc's mother.Doesn't



that count for anything? I want you out, and even if you refuse, you'll have to leave!"



Stella found the whole thing faintly ridiculous."Jazlyn,I'm not doubting your authority, but you can't sign those papers on Marc's behalf. If you're so determined,maybe spend your energy convincing him instead of wasting mine."



She had gotten what she needed from the meeting.With a cold nod, Stella slung her bag over her shoulder and headed for the door.



Jazlyn instinctively tried to block her path but couldn't find any justification, so she was forced to let Stella walk out unchallenged.


Still, Jazlyn refused to feel anxious-she comforted herself with the thought that it wouldn't be long before Stella paid the price.






###Chapter 40 The Image Of Stella's Alluring Figure



Stella made her way toward the exit, each step weighed down by a growing sense of unease.


Haley and Jazlyn had summoned her today under the pretense of discussing divorce, yet hadn't presented a single concrete offer. No compromises, and somehow she was expected to fall in line?



It was absurd.



Stella understood Jazlyn lacked formal education,but she wasn't a fool.


There had to be some hidden agenda they hadn't revealed.



She'd been turning it over in her mnind since the conversation ended, but nothing added up.


Maybe she was reading too much into it.


What she didn't know was that the moment she walked away, Haley and Jazlyn shared a conspiratorial look.






A smirk tugged at Haley's lips. "She really has no idea what's coming. We gave her the chance to bow out gracefully, and she turned it down."


Jazlyn, standing beside her, nodded with conviction.She had arranged the meeting as a final opportunity for Stella to walk away clean.


Had Stella agreed to the divorce, there would've been no need for underhanded tactics.


But since she'd refused, they no longer felt bound by restraint.



"She'll see," Jazlyn said confidently. "Once her name's dragged through the mud, Marc won't even look her way. And by then, leaving won't be her decision anymore."


Haley glanced at her, saw the gleam of satisfaction in her eyes, and broke into laughter right alongside her.


"Jazlyn, you're the best. I swear, I'll be the most loyal daughter-in-law you've ever had."


The location they'd picked for the meeting was on the third floor. As Stella walked toward the elevator,the doors slid open, revealing a man standing quietly,hands folded behind him.




She gave him a quick glance, then stepped inside.


Still, something about sharing that tight space with a stranger unsettled her. She instinctively moved to the far corner, positioning herself near the wall.


Her head tilted slightly downward, eyes fixed on the floor-or so it seemed. In truth, she was watching him closely from the edge of her vision.


The moment he took a step in her direction, her breath caught. Her body stiffened.


He was faster than she expected. Before she could react, he clamped a cloth over her mouth and nose.


Stella's eyes widened as panic set in, her limbs thrashing in resistance.


A sharp, chemical odor hit her immediately, harsh and overpowering.


The elevator, worn and sluggish, continued its slow descent.


She had entered on the third floor. The first floor was still far off.



Eyes shut tight, Stella lashed out with both arms,throwing every ounce of strength she had left. Even as the fog pressed in, she held her breath, clinging to the last shred of consciousness.



The elevator dinged. As the doors slid open, she landed a forceful kick at the man. In a split second,she slipped from his grip and bolted away.







Inside the lounge adjacent to the banquet hall on the first floor of Voyage Hotel, Luca handed a glass of champagne to William.


He knew all too well how much William disliked events like this.


"Mr. Briggs, I really believe Ms. Russell is the ideal choice for the project. She's head and shoulders above the others."



Luca truly believed it was unfortunate that Stella wasn't part of the project.



He couldn't wrap his head around why she had been excluded.Wasit	reallystill	about	the misunderstandings?


He hesitated, then added, "Also, earlier today, when she saw our car, she looked hesitant, almost anxious,and left right after. It felt like she didn't want to be misunderstood."




William remained silent, slowly turning the glass in his hand.



Luca, having worked with him for years, felt comfortable enough to speak plainly.


"Honestly, sir, I don't believe she's the kind of woman you perceive her to be. She's always been composed and respectful in everything she does."


Sure, there had been that awkward moment at the bar when she ended up on William's lap-but it was nothing more than a clumsy accident.


William set his champagne down and rose from the sofa without a word.



Luca hesitated, unsure what to make of the sudden movement. His next sentence stalled before it could leave his lips.


"My attention is needed elsewhere. Inform me of our guest's arrival," William said coolly, locking eyes with Luca for a brief moment before heading toward the door.


Luca stood still, watching him go, a knot of unease tightening in his chest.


Was William leaving because of something he'd said?
He gently slapped his mouth, silently scolding himself.He wasn't usually this talkative.


But the thought of Stella missing out on such an important opportunity had pushed him to speak up.


As William exited the lounge, he caught sight of someone running across the far end of the corridor near the elevator.



He slowed, eyebrows drawing together. The figure,dressed in white, stirred a flicker of recognition in him.


Without meaning to, his mind conjured the shape of Stella's form-graceful,unmistakable.


He parted his lips, ready to call out to her,but before he could speak, she darted through the stairwell door and vanished from view.


Maybe it wasn't her at all.












###Chapter 41 Use Them However You Want



William couldn't say for certain if the woman he saw was Stella, but the image of her on his lap that night,paired with her recent avoidance, lingered stubbornly in his thoughts. Brows drawn tight, he pulled out his phone and fired off a message to Luca.


"Find out if Stella's at the Voyage Hotel."


Stella burst from the elevator in a daze, her steps unsteady and frantic. The only exit nearby was the emergency stairwell, and without thinking twice,she pushed it open and slipped inside.


She didn't realize until it was too late, she was already on the ground floor, and the stairwell offered no exit except upwards.


She had only managed to climb a few steps when the sound of footsteps echoed from above, fast and heavy.



Her eyes lifted. More men were coming down, dressed like the one who had attacked her earlier.



The truth struck her instantly, she'd been herded
straight into a trap.



She spun around, desperate to escape,but the first man had already slipped inside behind her. His expression was twisted with cruel intent.


Her knees buckled, and she fell onto the cold steps.


"Please... I'll give you anything you want... just let me go..."



Her words barely made it out before a cloth was stuffed into her mouth. She was forced upright, and hauled up the stairs.


Stella whimpered softly, her vision blurring as tears filled her eyes.



Even before the drug, she would've struggled to resist their strength, now, her body felt like it no longer belonged to her.



Her thoughts were intact, but her limbs refused to respond. She couldn't stop them from dragging her into a hotel room.



"Quit fighting. We're not here to harm you,we just need a few dirty pictures." One of the men shoved her farther into the dimly lit room, his voice low and careless as he spoke.

The word "pictures" rang in Stella's ears, sharp and jarring.Pictures? What type of pictures...?


Before she could gather her thoughts, they forced her onto the bed. Hands clawed at her clothing,tugging with brutal urgency.


A rush of cold air from the open window brushed over her skin, and she began to shake uncontrollably.


It clicked in an instant-she finally understood the kind of pictures they meant to take.


"Who asked you to do this?" She had no clue who had paid these men, but the way they operated made one thing clear: they were in it for the money. Pushed to the edge of the bed, she edged backward, forcing herself to stay composed. "I have money. Whatever deal they made with you-I'll match it and add more!"


One of them scoffed at the offer. "Don't bother.This'll be over soon if you stop fighting."


They were just carrying out instructions and had no interest in dragging things out.


Backed into the corner of the mattress, Stella braced herself as they closed in. Her fists clenched so tightly her nails dug into her skin.

She fought to keep her breathing steady.


"You're doing someone's dirty work, I get it, but do you even understand this is a crime? Sooner or later,you'll be arrested. I'll report everything,and none of you will walk away clean. Or..." she paused,her voice steadying, "you take the money now, walk out that door, and I never mention this again. Think it over."


One of the men tilted his head, intrigued.He looked like he was about to say something. Then the door creaked open behind them.


Haley stepped into the room, a black plastic bag dangling from her hand and a cruel smirk tugging at her lips. "Don't waste your energy," she said coldly."There's no way out."


She dropped the bag onto the floor with a thud and strolled forward without hurry. "Since we're going to stage something like this, it better look real. People care about that now-believability," she added with a mocking tone. "These are your props. Use them however you want. And don't bother with condoms."






###Chapter 42 Forced To Sign A Contract


Stella stared daggers at Haley, her whole body trembling with rage.


Now she got it. This was a trap.


The whole thing-Jazlyn's call,Haley's absurd demand -it was all a setup.


Her stomach churned as her eyes landed on the disgusting toys strewn across the bed.


She clenched her fists and snapped, "Haley, this is illegal! You think having foreign citizenship means you're untouchabe?"


The men standing around shifted awkwardly. Fear flashed in a few of their eyes.


Haley was a foreign national.


They might've been scumbags, but even they didn't want to go down for something like this-especially not for a foreigner who could skip town the second things got messy.

Haley rolled her eyes and sneered. "You bunch of wimps. Just do what you're paid for. If anything goes wrong, I'll handle it. None of this is on you."


Then she turned back to Stella, voice dripping with spite. "And you-God, you really think you're on Marc's level? You're trash, Stella. You'll never belong in our world. Wanna hear the best part? Marc knows.He's the one who told me to do this. You should've signed that damn contract when you had the chance.Now, he wants you punished. This is what you get for crossing me."


She yanked a document from her purse, slapped it on the bed, and grabbed Stella's limp hand. With one hard press, she forced her fingerprint onto the page.


Stella couldn't move. Drugged. Tied up.


Tears burned in her eyes, but she refused to let them fall.


Haley straightened up, gloating. "There. Done. This contract's binding. And since you refused before,the patent rights now belong to Walsh Group-free of charge. No compensation. No way out."


She tossed Stella a final smirk and strutted toward the door. "She's all yours, boys. Enjoy."

And just like that, she was gone-leaving only shadows and danger behind.


A greasy voice rang out. "Damn, you smell good.So soft too. Bet you'll look real pretty crying."


Another one chimed in, laughing. "Which toy should we use first, huh? Or maybe just try them all."


"Don't touch me..." Stella's voice cracked,barely a whisper. But her body was too weak.


One of the men stepped forward, reaching for her.Bang! The door flew open with a violent crash.


"What the hell-?" They turned, startled.


Luca stormed in, flanked by black-suited bodyguards.Behind them, cold as ice,stood William.


For a second, Stella thought she was seeing things.


William?How could he be here?


Luca's eyes scanned the room-and locked on Stella.His expression darkened instantly. He barked, "Get these bastards out of here!"



The bodyguards moved fast, dragging the men out like trash. Their screams echoed down the hallway.

Luca glanced at Stella again, then quickly looked away.He knew this wasn't his moment. Without a word, he followed his men out.



Now,only William remained.


It was his first time seeing her so vulnerable, like a broken doll.



He walked over and knelt beside the bed and examined her, noting that her injuries were superficial.


Her pants were still in one piece.


He undid the ropes around her wrists with quiet care."Are you alright?"


When she was finally free, Stella didn't cry. She didn't speak. She just pulled the bedsheet tight around herself,burying herself beneath it.



###Chapter 43 She Would
Make Them Pay


Stella drewN several shaky breaths, fighting to keep her composure,but a tremor still ran through her limbs.


Her words came out unsteady, laced with vulnerability."I'm... all right,thanks."


Noticing the glimmer in her eyes, William's expression tightened,his tone softening without thinking."Come on. Let's get you out of here."


She nodded and tried to rise on her own, but the moment she put weight on her legs, they buckled beneath her.William, close at hand, caught her before she could hit the ground.


Before she could utter a word of protest, he had already scooped her into his arms.


A startled breath escaped her lips as she instinctively clung to his shoulders for balance.


William said nothing, simply tightened his grip and shifted her weight more securely against his chest.


"Careful," he murmured.


Then, without another word, he carried her steadily from the room.


Stella clung to him, her grip tightening as she inadvertently pressed against his chest.

No matter how carefully she tried to shift,her body brushed his with every small movement.


From where William stood, he couldn't help but notice the fleeting closeness of her chest against him, each soft contact tightening his jaw.


A flush rose in his face as he quickly looked away,carrying Stella in tense silence toward the car.


At the hospital, the doctor gave her a meticulous checkup. The scrapes were superficial-just a few days and they'd be gone. For now, they hooked up an IV to flush the remaining drugs out of her system before she'd be cleared to leave.


Stella sat motionless on the hospital bed, her gaze distant and shuttered.



William remained close, hunched over his phone in silence, doing nothing to add to the weight already pressing down on her.


Luca arrived soon after, pausing beside William. "Mr.
Briggs, we've identified those people, but..."


His voice faltered, uncertainty flickering in his eyes as he glanced at Stella.


William understood Luca's hesitation, especially with Stella there-but he looked her way, then gave a quiet nod. "Say it."


She deserved the truth.


"Some of them carry infectious diseases. If they'd laid a hand on Ms. Russell, the fallout would have been catastrophic."


When he initially heard it, Luca was visiblyshaken.


What kind of grudge could push someone to hire people this dangerous just to target Stella?


William's gaze sharpened, his expression turning icy.


On the hospital bed, Stella's fists twisted the blanket until her knuckles blanched.



Haley clearly meant to destroy her, no matter the cost.



After a tense pause, Stella finally turned to William."Mr. Briggs, thank you for everything you've done today. But from here on out, I'll handle it myself."


She didn't want to drag William into her mess. This wasn't his battle, and she refused to be in his debt.


Her voice sounded steady, almost detached, as if nothing could shake her.


But William could see she wasn't thinking clearly-not after everything she'd just endured.


How was she supposed to face this alone?


Pure bravado, but he had no reason to step into it.



William shot her a brief look, gave a faint nod, and rose to quietly exit the room.


Left alone, Stella bristled with a fury that made her whole body tense.


She had never wanted more than a clean divorce and to reclaim what belonged to her. Even Marc's betrayal with Haley could have been something she endured in silence.


The two of them were beneath her contempt; she'd hoped karma would take care of them in the end.


But their relentless cruelty had gone too far,crossing every line in their desperate attempts to destroy her.


If that was how they wanted to play, then she was




finished being merciful.


She would hit back with everything she had-and make sure they regretted every move.


Kicking off the covers, she pushed herself upright, the decision igniting her every nerve. Just as she started pulling on her coat, William paused inthe doorway,catching the sound of her movements.



His voice cut through the silence. "Where do you think you're going? Your IV's still running."





###Chapter 44 Preparing To Counterattack



Stella hunched her shoulders, fiddling with the collar of her coat as she answered without hesitation, "I'm heading to the research institute."


He'd assumed she was out for reckless revenge, but maybe she wasn't as impulsive as he thought.


William arched a brow, then said calmly, "Come on.I'll drive you."


The ride passed in silence, Luca focused on the wheel while William and Stella sat quietly in the backseat.


Stella sat with her gaze lowered, picking at a loose thread on her coat, her mind miles away.


When they reached the dormitory entrance at the research institute, William pulled over. Stella quietly murmured her thanks, still avoiding his eyes, and slipped out of the car toward the building.


Lainey was waiting in front of the elevator and flinched in surprise when she caught sight of her."Stella? What on earth happened to you?"



Lainey's voice pulled Stella from her daze. Her outfit,ripped during the hotel chaos, left her looking completely unkempt.



Her injuries had been tended to, but the skin still bore bold smears of reddish-brown iodine, impossible to miss.



Lainey's eyes went wide, her shock clear. How could Stella look like this? She'd seemed fine when she left the institute just hours ago.


"I'm alright, Lainey," Stella murmured, her words muffled as she kept her head low.



She hadn't let herself cry in front of William-afraid he'd see her as weak or overly dramatic.


But with Lainey, the friend she trusted most here, the urge to fall apart pressed painfully at the back of her throat.



Lainey's concern cracked something in Stella. She couldn't hold back any longer-tears spilled down her cheeks in heavy, silent drops.


Lainey's chest tightened at the sight. She wrapped Stella in a fierce hug. "Oh, dear, what happened?Don't be scared, I'm right here. Tell me-who did this to you? I'll handle them myself!"


Pressed close to Lainey's shoulder,Stella wiped her nose,her voice trembling. "It was Marc and Haley."


The mention of those two names sent a bitter jolt through Lainey's chest.


"Marc? Did he lay a hand on you? Has he completely lost it? The last time he hurt you was already more than enough!"



"No, he didn't lay a hand on me. Can we talk about this inside?"



Once they'd stepped into the lounge, Stella began to explain everything that had happened that day.


Lainey's jaw nearly hit the floor the longer she listened,her eyes going wide wvith shock.


"Wait-Haley actually did that to you? She ought to be behind bars!"



Taking in Stella's fragile demeanor, Lainey felt a fierce protectiveness rise up in her chest.


"Lainey, Haley forced me to imprint my fingerprint on the document when I had no strength left to fight her.I'm done working with them on that patent-they just stole it outright," Stella insisted, her voice trembling but resolute.

This wasn't a partnership anymore-they'd flat-out stolen the patent from her.


Lainey,who understood how much that patent meant to Stella, reached out and squeezed her hand."Don't stress, Stella. I'll help you get the patent back.Remember, you told me before you didn't want to sell to the Walsh Group? Well, I went ahead and found another buyer for you. I've actually been putting together the contract these past few days."


Stella's shoulders slumped in defeat. "But... Haley already took the contract with my fingerprint."


Lainey reached for her hand, her tone gentle but certain. "The buyer I found is trustworthy. Once you sign his contract, he'll take care of everything for you."


That contract Haley snatched hadn't been obtained through any fair or legal means.


If this dragged out to court, the Walsh Group would only end up losing.


Stella glanced at Lainey, a flicker of hope brightening her eyes. "Thank you."


It had never occurred to her that things could be dealt with like this.

Lainey's indignation simmered just beneath the surface,her jaw clenched. "Marc, honestly-how could he stoop so low? I used to believe he was dependable,the way he always hovered around you, acting like the perfect partner. Now it's obvious it was just a facade.It makes me sick. All those years together, and he never felt a thing for you? How could anyone be so cruel?"



Lainey honestly thought Stella was the most extraordinary woman she'd ever known-talented,gorgeous,impossible not to root for.


If it were up to her, she'd have shielded Stella from every hurt the world tried to throw her way.


Stella pressed her lips together, then glanced at Lainey across from her. "Lainey, I need a little help-can I ask you something?"


"Name it. As long as it's something I can do, I'm on your side." Lainey assured her, unwavering.


Sitting up straighter, Stella reached into her bag,rifling around before pulling out a small object and offering it to Lainey. "Could you help me with this?"



Now that everything had blown up with Marc, she had no intention of playing nice anymore.





###Chapter 45 A Noblewoman Stooped To Being A ...


Marc waited in the cafe for over an hour.


His clothes were dry now, but they clung to him cold and sticky, making him feel worse.


His head throbbed, and a low fever was creeping in.He'd had enough.


Just as he stood to leave, his phone buzzed. A message lit up the screen-it was from one of his long -term business partners.


"Mr. Walsh, the patent has expired. We'll be pausing our partnership with Walsh Group until further notice."


Marc stared at the message, brows furrowed. Then another one came in. And another. Different companies. Same message. All of them were pulling out-refusing to renew their deals unless Stella's patent was locked in.



Marc's frustration boiled over. He tried calling Stella immediately, but her number was blocked. He tried her email,messaging apps-nothing. Total silence.







She was cutting him off, proving she could do things her way.


Marc clenched his jaw, gripping his phone until his knuckles blanched.


He called a few other partners, trying to salvage what he could. No luck. Everyone gave the same answer: no patent,no deal.


For the first time in a long while, Marc felt completely cornered.



With several deals falling through, he needed to find new opportunities; otherwise, the company would inevitably suffer losses.



Finally,he decided to contact Haley.



"Haley,where are you?" he asked, voice low.



Haley was lounging at a spa, fresh off the high of ruining Stella. Her voice was sugary sweet. "At the spa.Why,miss me already?"


"There's a charity gala tomorrow night. I want you to come with me."



Haley's heart practically did a somersault. Marc almost never brought women to public events-especially when he wasn't bringing Stella.


She had a place in Marc's heart that Stella couldn't compete with.



She was already planning to leak the photos and videos from Stella's humiliation, but now? Now she had the perfect stage. At the gala, once those images were out, Stella's name would be dirt in all of Choria.


Marc would have no choice but to drop her completely.


Haley grinned to herself.


Tomorrow wasn't just Stella's downfall-it'd be her official debut by Marc's side.


She quickly texted her mother. Her mother had wanted to secure a deal with Walsh Group,but Haley's obsession with Marc had caused tension.



She and her mom had a big argument over Marc.Haley had insisted he didn't love Stella anymore,that it was all over between them.



But her mother wasn't buying it. She'd flat-out forbidden Haley from playing the other woman.


This was her perfect chance to prove her mother wrong.


Tomorrow would be her proof. At the gala, her 


mother would see the truth with her own eyes-Marc,publicly by her side, Stella completely out of the picture.


By the end of the night, Haley wouldn't be a sidepiece.She'd be the woman everyone was talking about.



"Sure, I'll be there on time," she purred into the phone."But Marc... I don't have a dress."



Marc sighed. He knew what she was getting at. "I'll pick you up early. We'll go shopping."



"You're the best! Love you!"


Marc ended the call with an irritated grunt, rubbing his temples.



This gala was important-he had a major potential partner attending. And Haley, with her Smith family background, might give him the edge he needed to sway the deal.


He smirked. Stella thought she could strong-arm him?She had no idea who she was messing with.



He didn't want to play dirty. He loved her.



But if she kept fighting him, he wasn't above teaching her a little lesson.


The next morning, Marc showed up early to take Haley shopping-he knew how long she could take.



He knew her routine, so he arrived just in time.



While she fussed over dresses, Marc waited on the boutique's sofa, flipping half-heartedly through a fashion magazine. His mind wasn't on fabrics or colors.He was already thinking about his pitch to the new investor.



"Marc, what about this one?" Haley called.


Without looking up, he muttered, "Yeah. Looks good."


Haley's smile faltered. Could he be thinking about Stella? She marched over, grabbed his face,and forced him to look at her. "Really? You haven't even seen it. Look properly."


Marc sighed and pulled himself back into the moment.He gave her a quick once-over, then wrapped an arm around her waist. "It suits you. The color works with your skin tone."


That was enough to satisfy her. She flashed a triumphant smile and told the sales clerk that she'd take the dress.



Then she headed off to get her makeup done,leaving
Marc to wait-again.


He leaned back and let his eyes drift shut for a second.And just like that, his mind went to Stella. She never wasted time on makeup or elaborate clothes.


A simple T-shirt, a ponytail, and she still looked effortlessly stunning.


Getting ready with her took ten minutes, tops.


Not like Haley, who took the whole day.


Hours later, everything was finally done, and they headed to the gala.


The venue was buzzing-full of elites from Choria's upper crust. As Marc and Haley entered, heads turned.



Whispers followed them like shadows.



"Who's the woman with Mr. Walsh? Isn't she the Smith girl? From Achury?"


"They're awfully close... Are they having an affair?"


Someone gasped, "No way. Would an Achury noblewoman really stoop to being a mistress? Or did Mr.Walsh already divorce his wife?"



The word divorce cut through the buzz of voices and hit Marc like a slap. His jaw clenched. His expression froze. That one word rattled something deep inside him.


###Chapter 46 To Beat Stella



Now wasn't the time to let emotions show. Marc quickly wiped the flicker of emotion from his face and kept moving through the crowd like he hadn't heard a thing. Whispers still lingered behind him, but he carried on, unbothered. At least, that's what it looked like.



Around them,guests exchanged knowing glances,but none dared say more out loud.


Haley noticed the way people were looking at her-curious,speculative-but instead of shrinking under their judgment, she lifted her chin proudly.


So what if Marc was still married? She was the one on his arm tonight.


And today? Today was the day Stella finally lost.

...

Up on the second floor, Marc spotted Mr. Williams and made his way over. "Mr. Williams, long time no see."


Mr.Williams, a sharp investor known for backing only winners, turned with a gentlemanly smile and extended his hand.

"Mr. Walsh. It has been a while."


Then Mr. Williams's gaze shifted to Haley, eyes narrowing just slightly.


Everyone in their circle knew about Marc's marriage to Stella.


For years, Marc had crafted an image of a loyal husband-reserved,deeply devoted.


So seeing another woman clinging to him tonight raised some unspoken questions.


But they were all adults here. No one would say it out loud.



Haley, all confidence and charm, stepped forward."Mr. Williams, it's such a pleasure to finally meet you.I've heard so much about your work."


Mr. Williams gave her a polite nod, though his smile didn't quite reach his eyes. His attitude was civil-but cold. Haley felt it instantly, and for a second,her smile faltered.



Before Marc could steer the conversation back,another guest swooped in to chat with Mr. Williams,cutting Marc off mid-sentence. Annoyance flashed in Marc's eyes, but he swallowed it down.






Haley tugged on his arm gently. "Marc, let's go over there?"


She was trying to sound casual, but inside, she was bursting with anticipation. According to the plan with Jazlyn, the photos should've been released by now.Any minute now.


Haley could already picture it-Stella's public humiliation, her mother showing up to see it all, and Marc finally realizing who deserved to stand beside him.


But when she checked her phone... nothing. No photos. No message. No Jazlyn.


Her smile tightened. What the hell was going on?Jazlyn had the whole day to send her the pictures.Why wasn't she sending them?


The plan had been airtight. Only she and Jazlyn knew about it.



Maybe Jazlyn got cold feet?


After all, they had initially planned to fake it,but yesterday,Haley had taken it a step further. She had the men do it for real.



Could it be that Jazlyn thought it was too much and deliberately withheld them?

She whipped out her phone and sent Jazlyn a direct message asking her to come over.



It would be easier to convince her in person.


Meanwhile, Jazlyn had been lounging at a private card table all afternoon, growing increasingly irritated.


She had waited since morning for the photos to arrive.Nothing. Even worse, the men they hired weren't responding.



Her usual perks-VIP salon appointments, luxury discounts-had mysteriously been revoked.


She'd meant to call Haley, but a card game with the other socialites had distracted her.


Now, seeing Haley's message, she jumped to her feet."Oh, you ladies keep playing. I've got to run-my son and daughter-in-law need me," she said smugly.


The other women exchanged amused glances.Daughter-in-law? Since when does she admit that?


On her way to the event, Jazlyn tried to make sense of it all. Maybe Haley got the photos directly and was waiting for her to show up so they could reveal everything together.
That would be perfect. The thought thrilled her.


###Chapter 47 Misunderstood

Jazlyn arrived at the charity gala in a frenzy,practically speeding the whole way.


The moment she stepped through the entrance,Haley-who'd been anxiously watching the door -spotted her and rushed over, heels clicking."Jazlyn!" she called sweetly, her voice almost musical.


Jazlyn turned and smiled, letting Haley clasp her hand.



She gave it a light, approving pat. "You look absolutely gorgeous, sweetheart. That dress is stunning on you. Did Marc pick it?"


Haley blushed, eyes dropping for a second. "He did. Said the color suited me. But if you think l look good, then I know I nailed it."


So far, Jazlyn was pleased. Haley, no matter how calculating in private, always made sure to
show her proper respect in public.


But Jazlyn was here for more than compliments."Alright, darling, why did you call me over?Something you need?"


She eyed Haley closely, trying to figure out if this was the big moment-if Haley was finally planning to release those scandalous photos of Stella.


And more importantly-why had the men gone off radar? No texts, no calls, no photos. Had Haley gotten to them first?


Jazlyn wanted to ask but bit her tongue. This wasn't the place.


Haley, meanwhile, watched Jazlyn's calm demeanor with growing relief.


She figured that Jazlyn didn't dare to post those photos after all.


Still, she couldn't say that out loud. Instead,she leaned in and spoke in a soft, suggestive tone.
"You know, tonight's a big deal. My mother's arriving soon to sign a direct partnership with Marc. But... with my current status, things are complicated..."


As if that explained it all, she pulled out a folded document from her clutch and handed it to Jazlyn.


"This," she said with a triumphant gleam,"is what Stella signed yesterday. Voluntarily. She was so scared, she didn't even argue. With this contract, the patent issue's resolved-and she's got nothing left to bargain with."


Her implication was clear-Stella had no more cards to play. Haley wanted Jazlyn to stop being hesitant and release the indecent photos already. Once Stella's name was ruined and Marc had no choice but to file for divorce, she'd finally be able to stand openly by his side. That way, her mother could confidently sign the partnership deal with Walsh Group.


Jazlyn's eyes darted around. She picked up on
wie unspoken message, but her interpretation leaned a little different. So Haley got to the photos first, now she wanted Jazlyn to be the one to light the fire.


Words had already reached Jazlyn's ears-Haley's mother, a major Walsh client, would be attending tonight's event.



That settled it for Jazlyn. She believed she now fully understood Haley's agenda.


She gave Haley's hand a light pat, smiling with feigned warmth. "Don't worry, dear. I get it."



Her eyes hardened with resolve. Haley wanted drama? Fine. It was just a matter of timing.And when those photos dropped-she would make sure it was unforgettable. She would handle it.


The two women exchanged a meaningful glance and headed into the banquet hall side by side.



Marc, deep in conversation with an executive,caught sight of Jazlyn entering. His jaw clenched. What the hell is she doing here?
He barely heard the man talking to him. Without hesitation, he cut the conversation short."Excuse me," he said stiffly and walked-away.


He stormed over to Jazlyn.



"Mom, what are you doing here?" His voice was low but sharp.



Jazlyn saw the irritation brewing in his eyes-but she was ready.


Grabbing Haley's wrist, she raised her voice-loud enough for the whole hall to hear.


、"Why shouldn't I be here? Huh, Marc?" she snapped. "Let me tell you something-Stella's not worthy of you! She's been messing around with other men behind your back! Shameless woman! You need to divorce her right now,before she drags the Walsh name through the mud!"


The hall fell into stunned silence. Gasps, wide eyes, and then the whispers began.
Haley blinked in surprise. She'd expected Jazlyn to start with the photo leak-not an all-out verbal assault. Still, she couldn't deny it-that was bold.


Jazlyn waited for Haley to follow through with the pictures. In that instant, MMarc's face darkened.


His voice boomed, sharp and cutting. "Mom,that's enough! What nonsense are you saying?"
###Chapter 48 Where Are The Photos




Jazlyn froze for a beat, caught off guard by Marc's cold tone. He had just dismissed her-publicly. Her face darkened.


After a tense pause, she huffed. "Look at you,Marc. Still defending that woman? She's been cheating on you! Haley is the one who actually deserves you. Divorce Stella already and be with someone who truly matches your status."



Before Marc could react, Jazlyn took Haley's hand and placed it firmly into his.


Haley,ever the opportunist, clutched his hand quickly and beamed at Jazlyn. "Don't worry,Jazlyn. I'll take good care of Marc."



Marc didn't say a word-he couldn't. His brain froze at the word cheating. What were they even talking about? Stella? Unfaithful?Impossible.
He had been with Stella for years. Through thick and thin. She wasn't perfect, but her integrity?That had never once wavered. Yes, she'd been in contact with William lately.


But Marc trusted her. He always had.



His gaze snapped to Jazlyn. "Mom, what are you really doing here?"


Jazlyn's smile thinned, her patience worn. But she wasn't about to back down now-not when the finish line was so close. From her bag, she pulled out a folded document Haley had handed her earlier. "I told you. I've seen the photos,Marc. They're disgusting! And you're still defending her?"


She handed him the contract. "Here. Look at this-Stella signed it herself. The same contract she refused to touch before. Why do you think she agreed so easily now? She's guilty, Marc.She's trying to clean up her mess quietly."


Marc stared at the document in his hands, a
strange chill crawling up his spine.


It was the patent renewal-a contract far more ruthless than the one he'd initially drafted.



Even he thought it was excessive.


But at the bottom, there it was. Stella's fingerprint. Clear, crimson and unmistakable.His pulse throbbed.


He blinked once, twice, as the realization sunk in. She signed this?


His chest tightened. Why would she do that?Why now?



Was his mother right? Had Stella betrayed him?


Was it William?



The signed contract did nothing to lighten his mood.



He tightened his grip on the paper, the corners curling under the strain. His jaw locked, eyes darkening with something dangerous.
Around them, the whispers ignited like wildfire.


Some made up their own unpleasant version of the incident.



Yet, a smaller group murmured doubts, refusing to believe Stella was what they were painting her to be.


Jazlyn and Haley exchanged a subtle glance.The tide was turning. All that was left was the final blow-the photos.


But minutes passed. Then more. No photos. No alerts. No shocked gasps from guests. Only silence.


Then, the grand doors of the hall slowly opened.


The guests turned in unison as Stella stepped into the hall, draped in elegance and quiet power.


She moved like she belonged, like the swirling rumors hadn't reached her at all-or worse, that
she didn't care.


Everyone recognized her instantly. The woman at the heart of tonight's scandal had just arrived in the flesh. Gasps rippled through the hall like falling dominoes.


What the hell is going on?



Was she here to defend herself?


To reclaim Marc? Speculations buzzed as eyes darted between her and Marc.



Marc's reaction was almost instinctive. He stepped away from Haley, as if burned-his face flashing with guilt, confusion, and a hint of panic.


He hadn't expected this. He'd promised her he wouldn't bring another woman to social events.


Haley and Jazlyn were equally shocked.


Haley's lips parted, but no words came out. She couldn't believe what she was seeing. After everything she and Jazlyn had done... After
Stella had supposedly been ruined... How was she standing here? Poised. Intact. Radiant.Jazlyn, too, was stunned. She had never thought Stella would dare show her face-Not tonight. Not after those photos.


All three of them-Marc, Haley, and Jazlyn-stared at Stella, their minds racing in different directions, tangled in schemes, panic, and desperate calculations. They wore the same expression-pure,unfiltered shock.
###Chapter 49 What On Earth Did I Do




Jazlyn looked over at Haley, confused.



Haley had said earlier that Stella agreed to sign the contract because she was terrified the pictures might go public.


Then what was Stella doing hére now?Shouldn't she be laying low?



And why hadn't the pictures surfaced?


What Jazlyn didn't know was that Haley had the exact same questions.



Those pictures!


Why were they still hidden?


Stella walked into the venue, her face unreadable, deliberately ignoring Marc and the group as she moved forward without pause.


Marc's chest tightened. Seeing her so
composed made something inside him twist.The fear that she might've betrayed him stirred a desperate urge to run after her.


But before he could move, Haley clutched his arm.


"Marc, don't let her intimidate you. My family's reasonable. Even if you leave Stella, they won't judge you. I'll still feel the same about you."


Marc started to draw his arm back, his brows knitting together, but before he could, a woman wrapped in a fur coat stepped forward.



It was Beatrice Smith-Haley's mother.


She'd been Marc's key contact in past business deals with the Smith family, one of his most significant clients.


The Smiths were one of the most respected families in Achury. Beatrice, however, was originally from Ushain and had deep roots here,
which is how Marc and Haley had first crossed paths.


As she passed Stella, Beatrice cast her a look full of disdain.



Beatrice stopped beside Haley and offered Marc a polished smile. "Mr. Walsh, our family usually wouldn't consider a man who's been divorced. But since Haley's chosen you, we won't stand in the way. Just make sure you resolve things with your ex-wife properly, and we won't object to your marriage. Everyone knows the problems in your first marriage weren't on you."


As Beatrice delivered the final line, she shot a pointed look in Stella's direction.



Stella's expression brimmed with biting irony.


So, they'd already condemned her, no proof needed,just theatrics.
And poorly executed ones, at that.


With a champagne flute in hand, Stella pivoted and walked straight toward Marc once more.



Haley,now flanked by Beatrice on one side and Jazlyn on the other, stared at Stella with smug confidence.


The pictures hadn't gone public, but she wasn't worried. She had backup, two people beside her, while Stella stood alone. What did Stella possibly have that could rival that?


"Stella, is it? After everything you've done,you'd be wise to sign the divorce papers and spare yourself the shame." Beatrice spoke to Stella like she wasn't worth basic politeness.


To her, Stella was beneath notice.



Stella didn't respond to her at all. Instead,she looked directly at Marc.

His face held a tangled mess of unease and hesitation, and Stella let out a soft laugh.


"Well, Marc," she said, voice calm but cutting,"tell me, what was my crime in this marriage?What did I do to deserve this kind of treatment from you?"


They weren't even legally separated, yet here he stood, silent, as these people dragged her through the dirt.


Was this what he meant when he spoke of love?



Haley and Jazlyn shared a glance, unsettled by Stella's composure yet convinced the plan had worked.


Jazlyn assumed Stella's fear of exposure had forced her to surrender.



Haley believed the pictures were still in Jazlyn's hands and would come out eventually.
They both blinked, mistaking each other's confidence for certainty.


Jazlyn was the first to speak, her tone dripping with scorn. "Stella, is this the kind of behavior you think suits a daughter-in-law? And you still have the nerve to ask what you did wrong? You were sleeping around while married, openly shameless. Isn't that reason enough?"


As soon as Jazlyn finished, Haley jumped in without hesitation.



"Ms. Russell, I used to believe your refusal to divorce came from real feelings for Marc. But if you truly cared about him, how could you be involved with other men and take such vulgar pictures? No one forced you in those shots, and the props, the outfits... I never expected you to be like that. I won't let Marc continue to be with someone like you!"


She spoke with a tone of moral outrage, as if it
were her duty to save Marc from ruin.


The surrounding guests turned their attention toward them, eager for more drama, as if Stella and Marc's scandal was the day's highlight.


"Seriously, Stella? Are you really that reckless?That's disgusting. Don't you even worry about your health?" Someone called out from the crowd.


The jeers escalated, each comment worse than the last.


"Honestly, someone from outside our circle probably wouldn't understand basic decency.No wonder Marc would rather be with the Smith girl after what Stella pulled."


"Who could tolerate their wife being with other men? Just imagining it is sickening."
###Chapter 50 Splash Wine Onto His Face





Just minutes ago, the crowd had been whispering behind Marc's back, yet the moment Haley cast the baseless accusations at Stella,their judgment shifted to Stella without hesitation. It was laughable how quickly they flipped, loyal to no one.


Stella didn't spare their words a second thought. After all, none of them actually knew her. If they could insult her today because of Haley, they could just as easily switch sides tomorrow.


So,it wasn't worth her time to argue with such fickle minds.


She threw a glance at Marc. His face was tight with hesitation, torn between sides, and Stella couldn't help but find the whole thing rather
amusing.


Then she shifted her attention to Haley,who looked far too pleased with herself. Stella's voice was calm but clear. "You're accusing me of sleeping around-do you have proof?Because if not, then what you're doing is slander. And I can take you to court for it."


Stella steppoed closer, staring at Haley. "You speak with such detail-about the toys, the outfits. Were you hiding there in the room? Or maybe, just maybe, you were the one who set all this up from the beginning?"


Stella had seen Haley at the hotel with her own eyes, so she was certain this had all been planned by Haley.


The wNay she spoke now didn't even sound like a question-it was more like a fact.



Haley stiffened. She knew what she'd done,but with Marc and the people watching, admitting it was out of the question.
She quickly shook her head, fumbling for words."W-Well, someone saw it and told me. Stella,haven't you heard the saying? The truth always comes out. You should really think about that."


Trying to regain her confidence, Haley stepped closer and raised her chin, forcing herself to look bold.


But the more she puffed herself up, the more obvious it became-she was guilty and scrambling to cover it.


Stella let out a quiet laugh. "Alright then.If you're so confident, show us the evidence.What toys? Which men? Let's see it."


Stella had learned this long ago-she didn't owe anyone an explanation, least of all people like them.


If Haley really believed what she was saying,then she should prove it. Otherwise, it was nothing more than hot air.


Haley shot a desperate look at Jazlyn, who only
frowned back, clearly just as lost.


Growing frantic, she urged, "Jazlyn!"-clearly signaling her to come up with something,anything.


But to her shock, Jazlyn flinched and blurted out, "Haley, show them the proof already! Didn't you say you saw everything yourself?"


Haley stood there stunned. What? Wasn't Jazlyn supposed to have the photos?



As it turned out, both had assumed the other had the proof. Now, their entire setup crumbled before everyone's eyes.


Stella watched their confusion play out like a poorly written script. She couldn't help but laugh lightly. "What's wrong? Can't find it now?Want me to give you a hand? Maybe I should start laying out the details... like when you and Marc started your little affair and what you two have been doing behind closed doors. Do you want me to spell it out for you?"
She wasn't bluffing. She always came prepared for moments like this.


The truth was, Marc and Haley had been so careless, she didn't even need concrete proof-their actions spoke for themselves.


As murmurs rippled through the room,people turned their eyes back to Marc and Haley, now standing awkwardly under the weight of public scrutiny.


The tension in the air was unbearable.



Marc's breath hitched as he met Stella's unwavering gaze.



For thefirst time, it hit him-she had known all along. Known about everything. And still, she hadn't said a word until now.


His voice trembled as he stepped forward."Stella,wait-please,let me explain-"


But Stella didn't flinch. As Marc moved toward her, she calmly raised the wine glass in her
hand, and in the next second, splashed the entire drink straight into his face.
###Chapter 51 Aren't These Injuries Evidence





It wasn't Marc's first time being splashed in public, yet the crowd still erupted in shocked murmurs.



He wiped his face, blinking as if trying to process what had just happened. Reaching out,he tried to take Stella's hand. "Stella, I trust you.Please,just hear me out."



"Don't lay a finger on me! I feel sick just looking at you." Without warning, Stella delivered a sharp slap across his cheek. "This is your idea of love, Marc? Loving two people at once? You call that real love? It's pathetic."


Marc stood frozen, stunned by the sting, but after everything that had just come to light,he bit back his anger. He reached out again and gripped Stella's arm-not tightly, but firm
enough to hold her still.


Stella let out a small cry. "You're hurting me!"


He immediately let go, startled, and only then did he notice the bruises and marks scattered across her skin. The sight left him shocked."Stella, what happened to you..."


Before he could finish, Haley's face lit up with sudden realization.



Then it had to be true-Stella had actually been raped by those men. The visible injuries alone spoke louder than any photograph ever could.


Grinning with triumph, she released the arm she had been holding and declared loudly, "You keep insisting you're innocent, but what about those bruises, Stella? Isn't that the aftermath of your night with them?"


The aftermath of her night with them?



Gasps rippled through the crowd, some even covering their mouths in disbelief.
Even in their elite circles, such behavior, though not unheard of, was always kept behind closed doors.


No one ever talked about those things in the open.


And yet, here was Stella, showing up to a public event with visible marks and not the slightest sign of shame.


"You only signed the patent renewal yesterday because we caught you, didn't you? You were scared we'd expose everything." With a triumphant smile, Haley snatched the contract from Marc and held it up in front of Stella like a trophy."You could barely stand straight and yet you were still begging them not to stop. You kept saying how much you liked it. Do you really think anyone would forget a scene that disgusting? And now you want to act like you're the victim?"


Her words were sharp, vulgar, and completely indifferent to the people around them.
The uglier Stella's expression became, the more energized Haley seemed.


Stella's brow furrowed, and in the next second,she grabbed Haley's wrist hard. "You know what you did is a crime, right? You could go to prison for this."


Flashes of the previous day surged through Stella's mind, dragging the fear from that moment back into her chest.


Marc, meanwhile, stood frozen, Haley's words echoing in his head. What was she trying to say?


Could Stella really have done something like that?


The thought alone rattled him, stealing his focus from everything else-including Haley's behavior. His attention narrowed entirely on the disturbing possibility that Stella had been with other men. A storm of anger gathered in his eyes.
But the moment he met Stella's icy stare,reality struck him like a blow. The cold clarity in her eyes cut straight through his confusion. "Haley,what did you do?"


The words came out like venom, barely held back by restraint.



Was Haley responsible for those bruises on Stella? Had she set something up?


Haley's body shook, and for a moment, she couldn't speak.



She lowered her head and didn't dare to face him.


But it didn't take long before she glanced up again, tears gathering in her eyes. She looked at Marc with a trembling, helpless expression."Marc, please don't believe her lies. She's only accusing me because | uncovered the truth.Now she's trying to twist it all and make me the villain!"
###Chapter 52 Exposed By Accident




Beatrice was fuming after hearing Stella accuse Haley. She was certain her daughter hadn't said anything of the sort.


She stepped forward protectively, positioning herself in front of Haley. "Ms. Russell, y/ou might be bold, but that doesn't give you the right to spout lies. That accusation is completely out of line."


Not giving Stella a chance to reply, Beatrice turned to Marc with her chin held high. "Mr.Walsh, I only agreed to work with you because of Haley's feelings for you. But after this baseless slander against my daughter, I see no reason to continue our partnership."


And with that, she made a show of turning to leave,signaling for Haley to follow.



Haley, of course, didn't want to go. But she was
scared Stella might actually expose something real. So, even though she hesitated, she followed her mother.


Still, she dragged her feet slightly, watching Marc out of the corner of her eye, hoping he'd stop her.



Marc, however, found himself stuck between two paths.



At first, teaming up with the Smith family had seemed like the smart move-he figured their power and connections could help pull his company through the storm.


To make it work, he didn't mind entertaining Haley's obvious interest in him. She was eager and persistent, and at the time, he hadn't seen any harm in playing along.


But now, if what Stella said was true, then there was no longer any need to keep up the act. He couldn't keep pretending for the sake of business, not when it meant letting someone
like Haley get close enough to hurt Stella.


That thought hit him hard, and his expression darkened. He turned to Haley, eyes sharp and cold, a storm brewing behind them. "Hold on-what exactly did you do to Stella?"


Haley's heart pounded. Trying to keep her voice calm, she said, "Marc, I haven't done anything!Don't you believe me? Hasn't Stella been ignoring you lately and staying away from home?"


She wasn't wrong. Marc had complained about Stella avoiding him, often saying she'd been staying at her work dorm.


Haley had stored that information in her back pocket, and now, she brought it out like a trump card.



"If she's innocent, then why hasn't she come back home?" she added slyly.



Her words hit their mark. Marc's mind spun.
Stella had been distant lately-was there something going on between her and William?


William had connections. Could it be that Stella was leaning on him... maybe even getting close to someone else through him?


He glanced over at Stella, suspicion clouding his gaze.He looked torn, as if caught between love and betrayal.


He still loved her deeply. But if she had cheated on him... he wasn't sure how he'd even begin to deal with it.


The moment Stella met his eyes, she understood-Haley had gotten to him. Again.


Before Marc could utter a word, Stella gave him a frosty smile, pulled a recorder from her bag,and pressed play.


The speaker's voice rang out clearly: "Do whatever you want. If anything goes wrong, I'll handle it."
Then came another voice-sharp and mocking."Stella, Marc told me to handle this. You refused to sign the contract nicely, so this is your punishment. Let's see how proud you act next time!"


Before meeting Jazlyn and Haley, Stella had had a gut feeling something wasn't right. Trusting her instincts, she had tucked a recording device into her bag-just in case.


She never took it out, and when she left later,she didn't get the chance to turn it off before those men grabbed her.


That was why the recorder stayed hidden in her bag,quietly recording everything that happened in the hotel room.


Later, during the struggle, Stella had hit the mnen with her bag, which damaged the recorder.


Yesterday, she gave it to Lainey to see if it could be fixed.



And luckily, after some repairs, the recording
cIem

turned out to be fully intact.


Once the recording finished playing, Stella walked up to Haley with a cold look in her eyes.


Haley stood frozen in disbelief, completely blindsided by the fact that Stella had recorded everything. Just moments ago, she had been so sure of her win-so confident that she'd come out on top. But now, all of that had crumbled.


Stella didn't let up. With calm intensity, she stepped forward until Haley was backed up against the wall. "What now, Haley? Got anything to say? Or are you going to tell everyone that the recording is fake? That I made it all up?"


Her words hit hard, leaving Haley stiff and speechless, unable to respond or even lift her head.


At the same time, Jazlyn-who had been standing beside Marc-suddenly lost her composure.
She spun on Haley and shouted, "What? You actually sent people to rape Stella? Haley, our plan was just to take some fake photos. That was it!"


Jazlyn's face twisted with horror. As much as she hated Stella, she'd never planned to cross the line into something truly criminal.


She just wanted to humiliate her with some staged shots-enough to scare her, nothing more.



After all, they were both women. And Jazlyn wasn't the kind of person to take things that far.


She had assumed Haley shared her limits, but clearly, Haley was far more ruthless than she had ever imagined.


That realization made Jazlyn's skin crawl. lf someone like Haley became Marc's wife, who knew what twisted things she might do if she ever felt threatened or cornered?


Taking a quick step back, Jazlyn put space
between herself and Haley. She wanted no part of her anymore.


But in trying to protect herself, Jazlyn didn't realize her outburst had just confirmed her own role in the setup against Stella.


And in ttheverynextmoment,the /room exploded with shocked whispers and raised voices.
###Chapter 53 Your Mother Told Me To Do It





Marc's face darkened with anger as he turned to stare straight at Haley.



Haley's eyes filled with tears, but no matter how many times she shook her head, nobody believed her.



The recording Stella played was clear and impossible to deny. There was nothing Haley could say to get out of it.



She looked at Marc, hoping for some support,but all she saw in his eyes was disappointment and cold disgust.


She quickly turned to Jazlyn, but Jazlyn had already stepped away, clearly not willing to stand by her anymore.


Haley felt crushed inside, but then she clenched
her teeth and pointed straight at Jazlyn. "Marc,it's not what it looks like! Everything I did... your mother told me to! You know she never liked Stella. She wanted you to leave her. She made me do this!"


Her words shocked everyone. Now all eyes were on Jazlyn, who stood frozen in her elegant dress.


"You're lying about me! I never told you to do anything like that. Stop blaming me without proof!" Jazlyn was so angry that she completely lost her composure.


Her reaction only made her seem even more out of control.



"Jazlyn, don't lie now! You were the one who said Stella wasn't even able to have kids, that she didn't have the right background to be good enough for Marc. You told me to figure out a way to make her leave him on her own. This was all your idea!" Haley shouted.
She didn't care anymore.


She couldn't afford to lose completely, not now.



So she had to sacrifice Jazlyn!


Marc looked at his mother with a chilling stare.It all made sense now. These were exactly the kinds of things she would say.


So it was true-his own mother and Haley had planned this all along.


Stella stood quietly, watching them tear each other apart with a cold smile.



Not long ago, they were pretending to be one big happy family.Now?


They were crumbling from the inside, and she hadn't lifted a finger.


Her eyes remained distant as she held the recorder tightly in her hand, quietly taking in the chaos.
Meanwhile, back in his office, William was going through some paperwork when Luca came in holding a file. "Mr. Briggs, Ms. Russell has already signed. Here's the contract."


William looked over the signature and instantly recognized Stella's neat handwriting. "Did she ask for anything else?"


Luca shook his head. "No, she signed it easily.Didn't ask for anything."


William wasn't the least bit surprised. That was just like her.   


Noticing that Luca hadn't left, he asked, "Is there more?"



Luca paused, then said, "Ms. Russell went to the Choria charity event by herself tonight."


William stopped what he was doing, something shifting in his gaze. "Was the Walsh family there too?"


Luca nodded. "Yes, and there's already been
some drama. Ms. Russell played that recording from the other day."


William raised his brows in surprise. Stella had recorded it? That, he hadn't expected.


Just imagining her handling it all on her own at such a big event made things a lot more interesting.


It was exactly the kind of bold move she would pull.


William set his pen down and grabbed his coat.


Luca looked confused. "Are you heading out,Mr.Briggs?"


William fixed his collar calmly. "She's our partner now. We just signed that deal-if something happens to her, it could affect the company."


His explanation made sense, and Luca quickly nodded. "I'll take you there,sir."


On the way, Luca kept sneaking glances at
William in the rearview mirror.



Was this really just about business?



Somehow, it didn't feel like it. He'd never seen Mr. Briggs act like this over any woman-not until Ms. Russell.
###Chapter 54 I Don't Want Your Money





The chaos in the banquet hall hadn't died down one bit. Stella stood still, watching as Haley and Jazlyn dragged each other through the mud,spilling almost every dirty secret they'd ever kept.


Jazlyn wasn't one to go down quietly. The second Haley started throwing accusations,she fired right back-no hesitation.


"Haley, you've got some nerve," she snapped."You knew my son was married and still chased after him like a lost puppy. Everyone at Walsh Group has seen you throwing yourself at him.And let's not forget-you hired thugs to kidnap Stella!"


Haley's face turned ghost-pale. "Don't you dare pin that on me! You're the one who told me to do it. I wvas following your orders!"
Stella listened quietly from the crowvd, her eyes narrowing at Haley.


At first, she'd thought Haley was just another spoiled brat-pampered overseas, loud and entitled.


But after what she pulled... Stella realized something else entirely. People raised in Achury acted like the laws in Choria didn't apply to them. They did whatever they wanted and expected to get away with it.


Haley had no conscience. She'd done those things without flinching-and she'd absolutely do them again if she got the chance.



Even if Stella eventually divorced Marc, Haley was someone she'd always need to keep an eye on.



She glanced at Marc, who hadn't said a word all this while. His expression was dark, like the ground had just shifted beneath him. Good,Stella thought.
Bet he never imagined that while he was busy thinking he had everything under control, the two women closest to him were running their own shady games behind his back.


What a crisp slap to the ego.



Realizing she was losing ground with Jazlyn,Haley suddenly switched gears.


With tears in her eyes, she turned toward Stella and rushed over, pushing past Marc and his mother.


"Ms. Russell, I'm so sorry," she said breathlessly. "This is all on me. I was tricked by Marc's mom. I swear, I never meant to hurt you.Whatever compensation you want-money,anything-just say the word. My family will pay Please...forgive me."


The implication was clear-she was admitting Stella had been violated.


Stella let out a soft scoff. "Oh? And how much exactly were you planning to offer me?"
Haley's face lit up,thinking Stella was willing to settle. "Whatever amount you want! Just name it.My family can afford it."


Typical Achury elite. To them, money fixed everything.



Marc's brow furrowed. Why would Stella even entertain this?


Had he ever denied her money? Why go to Haley of all people?


Haley was still watching Stella with hopeful eyes, desperate for a number-any number.



But Stella? She was enjoying every second of it.


The more hope Haley showed, the sweeter the fall.



"Haley," Stella said coolly, "not everything in life can be solved by throwing money at it. I don't want your money. I'm taking the evidence to the police. Let them handle it."


Her voice was calm, but her smile was ice-cold.
Haley's face fell in an instant.



She opened her mouth to say something else,but Stella cut her off with another sarcastic smile. "Oh-and by the way. All that effort you put in? It was a waste. Your guys failed. There are no pictures. I just walked away with a few scratches."
###Chapter 55 The Real Outsider



What?



That was the breaking point for Haley. Hearing those words sent her into a silent rage.



She was convinced that no matter how messy things got for her, Stella would be dragged down too. She had stirred enough chaos to ruin Stella's name.


And now? Now Stella was saying she wasn't even harmed that night?


That couldn't be right.


She was seconds away from exploding.


But with everyone watching, she swallowed her anger, even though her face said otherwise-tight jaw, clenched fists, the works.



Meanwhile, Marc-standing just a few steps away-let out a long, quiet breath. For him, the
news came as a massive reliet.


Marc loved Stella deeply. Even if something terrible had happened to her, he wouldn't have walked away.


But if she really had been violated, he knew he wouldn't be able to touch her again.



No matter how much he cared for her, he couldn't ignore his obsession with purity. He wasn't the kind of man who could pretend nothing had changed if his wife had been with someone else.


So when he heard that Stella had only suffered minor injuries, it felt like a blessing from above.



The fear had been eating him up inside. Now that it turned out to be false, he promised himself he'd hold onto her tighter.


He felt overwhelmed with relief and moved toward Stella, wanting to tell her to be more careful. But just as he reached out, she slapped him hard across the face.
"Didn't I tell you to stay away from me? You make me sick."


It wasn't the first slap today either. She'd done it once already.



Everyone around them gasped in shock-no one expected her to go off on Marc like that.


"Stella?" Marc stood there, stunned. His cheek stung, but he didn't care-he just wanted to talk to her, to explain.


Stella,however,took a step back and didn't give him the chance. "I'm not done with you yet.That patent? It's been under a different company for a while now. Your people forced me into a deal I didn't wNant, and they kept using my work after the deal expired. That's illegal."


When she brought up the contract, Marc remembered the one Haley had handed him.His unease was written all over his face.



"My new partners have already taken a hit because of your actions. Even if I wanted to
spare you, they won't. So you'd better be reaay for a huge payout." Her tone was icy. They were still technically married, but there wasn't a flicker of warmth in her eyes.


Marc's heart dropped. The contract worried him, sure-but what really scared him was how cold and done she looked.



Haley, sensing a chance to twist things,quickly jumped in. "Oh, come on, Stella! Do you really think anyone's going to buy that story? Who would ever dare sue the Walsh Group? That patent's been under their name for years-everyone in the industry knows it. No one would even go near it!"


In her mind, all this talk was just Stella's way of pulling Marc back in. "You're just trying to play the sympathy card so Marc won't divorce you.You think that's gonna work? What do you even have to offer? I can bring him real deals-foreign investors, key partnerships. You've got nothing."


Haley never saw herself as second best to
Stella. Not for a second.


The only distinction lay in having met Marc at a later juncture.


Yet in matters of affection, did precedence hold any relevance?


The one who wasn't loved was the real outsider!



"What have you even done besides that one lucky patent? If Marc hadn't backed you up,you'd have been out on the streets a long time ago. That patent? He only used it because he felt sorry for you. Do you seriously think you're some brilliant inventor?"
###Chapter 56 He's Backing Her Up         



Haley stared at Stella with visible contempt, as though she hadn't been the one pleading moments ago.


Stella remained silent, allowing Haley to unleash her fury uninterrupted. Once the outburst ended, she spoke in a steady tone. "You call me disgraceful, but what about your own behavior?Public misconduct, knowingly becoming someone's mistress, and doing it all with pride-this is what passes for aristocratic grace in Achury? What an inspiring example of moral decay."


Haley opened her mouth but couldn't form a response. Instead, she stamped her foot in irritation.


Unbothered,Stella went on. "You say my patent is worthless, yet the Walsh Group's success over the years would suggest otherwise. Should
we talk about those flawed contracts of yours?Or maybe look at the patent agreements that clearly outline the monthly fees owed? Take a closer look and see whether Walsh Group's actually paid me."


Living off someone else's work while pretending to be righteous, what a joke.


Haley clenched her jaw, unwilling to back down."You keep saying someone signed your patent deal, then prove it. Where's the contract? Aren't you always going on about having evidence?"


She was certain Stella had nothing to show, and that belief fueled her boldness.



"Go ahead, bring it out. I want to see who dares challenge the Walsh family!" Beatrice had come to Haley's side again, standing tall and offering her silent backing.


She placed her full trust in her daughter,not Stella.



By doing so, she made one thing clear: anyone
bold enough to sign a contract with Stella wasn't just opposing the Walsh family, they were going up against the elite circles of Achury as well.


The confrontation dragged on, and the crowd buzzed with anticipation, waiting to see whether Stella could actually produce the agreement she claimed to have.


But the contract had been finalized at the research institute, and Lainey was the one holding the document. Stella didn't have it with her.


Just as she reached for her phone to ask Lainey to send a copy, a voice rang out from beyond the crowd. "I'm the one who signed her patent.Is there an issue with that?"


A hush fell over the gathering.


Heads turned instantly, and the crowd stepped aside to make way. William appeared, walking in with confident strides.
It was him!


Not just a mysterious figure behind the research institute, but also a powerful businessman.


Even Stella was caught off guard by his presence.


She knew Lainey had arranged a new partnership for her, but she hadn't imagined that her new employer was William himself.


William spotted Stella standing by herself,facing a small crowd of hostile faces, and walked directly toward her.


Positioning himself beside her, he turned toward Haley and Marc, his voice sharp and cold. "I'm the one who signed the contract. Does anyone here have a problem with that?"


William's influence far outshone that of the Walsh family. The fact that he had acquired Stella's patent proved it held real value, contrary to everything Haley had claimed.
"After years of working with the Walsh Group,Ms. Russell hasn't received a single payment.But let me make this clear," William said,directing his words to the room, "I run a principled company. You'll be paid every cent you're owed, Ms. Russell. And my legal team will assist you in recovering everything you're entitled to."


Marc's behavior of living off Stella's work without compensation was, in William's eyes,pathetic.


Turning back to her, William gave Stella a warm smile, his expression calm but filled with assurance.


Stella inhaled sharply. She'd never seen him look at her like that before. Her eyes fluttered,uncertain if what she saw was real-or if her mind was playing tricks on her.
###Chapter 57 Save Face In Front Of William




Marc saw the way William and Stella looked at each other and felt a sharp pang of jealousy. He wanted to step in and pull them apart, but William's high status made him hesitate.


All he could do was glare at Stella, silently hoping she'd notice his frustration and take the hint to back away from other men.  

Being a man, he could easily recognize the meaning behind William's gaze. It was possessive and dangerous.


But Stella didn't look at him even once. She didn't care.



Haley studied the man beside Stella. Sure,he was good-looking and tall, but so what?


"And who exactly do you think you are?" Haley
sneered. "Saying you signed some contract doesn't make it real. Did Stella hire you to play along in this little act of hers?"


Haley had grown up in Achury and only moved to Choria because of Marc. She didn't know many people here.


So in her eyes, William was just some extra Stella had pulled in-not someone powerful.



Beatrice crossed her arms with a scoff. "What matters is proof, not who can talk the biggest game."


The people at the banquet held their breath.Haley might not know who William was, but they all certainly did.


And now, they waited eagerly to see how Haley and her mother would embarrass themselves.



William, on the other hand, didn't lose his temper. Instead, he let out a quiet, amused chuckle.
It had been a while since he'd come across such pure stupidity.


Honestly, seeing just how foolish people could be every now and then wasn't the worst thing-it was almost entertaining.


"William Briggs," he said calmly. "Heir to the Briggs family in Briset. The MUE project with the Achury royal family and the Hookwood Research Institute? All under my name. Is that enough to qualify for Ms. Russell's patent?"


Towering at 6.2ft, his presence alone was enough to make Haley and Beatrice feel small.


Haley remembered her father talking about the MUE project-it was a huge deal, and they couldn't even get close to it. Yet this man had secured it himself.


It was tied to royalty, something even local elites failed to win. Was William really that powerful?


Beatrice was just as stunned, though her experience helped her hide her reaction better.
Jazlyn, who had been quiet until now, was shaken by what she had just heard.


She never imagined that this man was the head of one of the top business groups in Briset. His status was something most could only dream of.


How in the world did Stella end up knowing someone like him?


Marc already knew who William was, but watching him stand beside Stella with such calm authority made his blood boil.


"Stella, come here," Marc said firmly. "You're still my wife. Being seen beside someone like Mr.Briggs might cause rumors."


Stella frowned. She could tell Marc was only saying this to protect his wounded pride.



Hearing that, William let out a cool chuckle."Oh? So you do remember she's your wife, Mr.Walsh? That's funny! I thought the woman beside you was your true match."
His words, sharp and dripping wilI Saivaon -Marc red with embarrassment.


Marc clenched his jaw, his fists curling at his sides.


"Stella," he called again, hoping that if she came over now, he might still save face in front of William.


But Stella stepped away. "Marc, stop the act.I was serious when I said I wanted a divorce.You betrayed me first. What did you expect would happen?"


Did he really think she'd stay chained to him forever?
###Chapter 58 Serious About Calling The Police




Marc felt a wave of panic surge through him the moment Stella brought up divorce again.


"Stella, I know you're upset today," he said,trying to sound calm. "Let's talk when we get home, alright? Whatever apology you want, I'll give it to you. Just... come here. Don't make a scene."


Stella let out a cold laugh. He thought she was just being dramatic?


Marc glanced at William. "Mr. Briggs, regardless of what happened, you signed my wife's patent.I'm genuinely happy for her. Thank you for recognizing her talent."


He emphasized "my wife" deliberately-staking his claim in front of William.
It was a move meant to intimidate, to mark his territory. As long as the divorce wasn't finalized,he still had that hold over her.


Haley, standing just behind him, nearly combusted on the spot. Her face twisted in fury.



William watched it all, amused. "Mr. Walsh,perhaps you should focus on calming your mistress. She looks ready to blow. As for Ms.Russell's patent-her work speaks for itself.It's got nothing to do with you. So there's no credit for you to take."


William wasn't usually this talkative and Stella felt moved.



It felt like justice-to finally have someone on her side who saw through Marc's performance.



Every time she confronted Marc, he twisted it into some petty tantrum, some jealous outburst.



But now, with William exposing him in front of a crowd, Stella felt a deep sense of vindication.
Marc's face darkened. The charity event had gone up in flames for him. And worse, Stella wasn't on his side anymore.


She was staring at him now-stone-faced,unmoved.


Marc stared at Stella's unwavering expression,his anger overshadowed by panic. His fingers trembled.


He didn't want to lose her. He couldn't lose her.



Divorce? Absolutely not.



Gripped by desperation, he reached out to grab her hand again, thinking maybe-just maybe-he could reel her back in. But before Stella could even move, William stepped in and blocked him without hesitation.


Marc froze. Stella looked at his pitiful, wounded expression-and felt absolutely nothing.


She'd been through too much with him-and Haley. Whatever pain he was in now didn't even
scratch the surtace of what she u enuuicu.


Marc opened his mouth to say something when -WEE-OOO. The sound of police sirens sliced through the banquet hall. Moments later, a team of officers walked in, their expressions hard and professional.


One of them read from a file, "We received a report of kidnapping and assault. Haley Smith,Marc Walsh, and Jazlyn Walsh-please come with us."


Haley's mouth dropped open. Stella had really called the police?



She turned pale, grabbing her mother's hand in a panic. "Mom, I don't want to go!"


Beatrice was stunned. But she didn't believe her daughter had committed such a crime.


Then, snapping to action, she turned to the officers. "This must be a mistake. My daughter hasn't done anything wrong! You can't just arrest someone over an accusation."
But the officer was firm. "We'll sort that out at the station, ma'am. Please don't interfere."


Beatrice's heart dropped.


Back in Achury, she could've shut this down with a single call.


But this was Choria-her name meant nothing here.


She'd only come because Haley insisted, and now she was standing helpless as her daughter was about to be taken away.


Haley clung tightly to her mother's hand,pleading with her eyes. But the officers were already moving in.



One stepped forward with handcuffs. His voice was flat. "Ms. Smith, please come with us."
###Chapter 59 Wishing The Ground Would Swallow Her Whole 




Haley was panicking, backing away in a frenzy."No! I didn't do anything wrong! Why should I go with you? I'm not going-don't touch me!"


The police didn't even flinch. Her outburst didn't faze them one bit. When she wouldn't cooperate, one of the officers calmly reached for the handcuffs on his belt. "We'd appreciate your cooperation, ma'am. If you're really innocent, the truth will come out. Justice always does."



That word-justice-sent Haley into full-blown hysteria. "MAom, say something! We're not from here, we don't know how things work! Stella's lying! Please-do something!"


Beatrice looked just as helpless. She reached out, but with the cuffs already closingin,there
was nothing she could do.


She could only watch as her precious daughter was led away in shame.


Meanwhile, Jazlyn had been slowly trying to sneak off through the crowd. But the moment she heard the officers call her name, she froze like a deer in headlights.


"Jazlyn Walsh?"


She turned around, visibly shaking. "Officer-l swear, I don't know anything! I'll come with you.I'll tell you everything I do know!"


To be fair, she really didn't know much. Haley had done most of the scheming on her own.


Since Jazlyn wasn't resisting, the officers didn't cuff her.


One look at her terrified face, and it was clear she wasn't the ringleader. Two down. One to go.



Marc never expected Stella to pull this move-calling the police right there at the gala and
having them take him too.


He might've tried to slip away quietly, but Jazlyn, clueless as ever, called out to him,blowing his cover.


And just like that, the grand charity gala came to a crashing, scandalous end. Guests stood around whispering, wide-eyed and stunned.


With Marc taken away, Stella finally turned to leave. She hadn't come to party anyway.


"Where are you going?" a calm voice asked beside her.



She turned to see William walking up, his tone low and casual.



"Back to the research center," she answered truthfully.


Since deciding to end things with Marc, she hadn't stepped foot in the villa. She'd already packed up anything important. No reason to go back.
William nodded. "That's on my way. I'll drop you."


Stella blinked, surprised. It was already late-was he heading there too?


"There's no need, Mr. Briggs. I can manage,"she said quickly.


She didn't want to keep riding around in his car.She already owed himn a favor-racking up more debt wasn't part of the plan.


William just kept walking beside her and smirked. "I help you out once and now you're trying to keep your distance?"


That comment caught her off guard, and she flushed.



Yes, she owed him thanks for earlier-but what did that have to do with getting in his car?


Still, she said nothing and awkwardly followed him to the vehicle. She opened the door, slipped inside, and sat quietly.
Luca was driving. Stella and William sat in the back.


In her flustered state, she forgot to fasten her seatbelt.



The ride was smooth at first, the silence almost comforting. Stella let herself relax just a bit.



But then, at a junction, the car made a sharp turn and suddenly braked hard. Before she could react, her body lurched sideways-and she crashed right into William.


Her hands shot out to steady herself, but it was too late.



She slammed straight into his chest.



And to make things worse, her chest-soft and unprotected-ended up pressed right against his arm.


As if that wasn't enough, the sudden jolt tugged at her clothes, and with a loud snap, one of the buttons on her blouse popped open.
Stella froze, her face burning. If there was ever a moment to disappear, this was it. She seriously wished the ground would open up and swallow her whole.
###Chapter 60 The Suit Should Fit Perfectly This Time




Stella didn't even dare to glance at William.She instantly scooted away to put space between them-and that was when her hair snagged on his belt buckle.


The sharp tug made her wince.



She shifted again, trying to free herself... but it just made things worse. Now it looked like she was doing it on purpose.


She froze.



God, no. Absolutely not intentional.


But instead of pushing her away like last time,William just glanced down and said calmly,"Don't move."


Then he leaned forward and gently untangled her hair.
Stella scrambled back the second she was free,face burning.


She clutched her shirt closed and backed away until there was a very proper, very professional gap between them. "I'm so sorry, Mr. Briggs! I didn't mean it at all-the car turned suddenly,and I just... lost my balance. I swear I have no improper intentions toward you whatsoever!"


She looked so serious one would think she was taking an oath.



William raised an eyebrow, clearly amused by her dramatic sincerity.



But Stella took that look the wrong way. She thought he didn't believe her.


She rushed to add, "If I did have any improper thoughts about you, then may I get hit by a car the moment I step outside!"



Even Luca, up front, flinched at that.


Stella was clearly pulling out all the stops just to
clear the air.


William's lips twitched. "No need for such a dramatic curse. I'm not blind. I saw what happened-it was the turn."


Stella muttered under her breath, "Well, you were basically blind last time."



He hadn't been like this last time.



She thought she'd said it quietly enough. She hadn't. The entire car went silent-awkwardly so. William heard it. Luca definitely heard it.



Luca cringed.


William's voice came, low and unreadable."Where'd that come from?"


Stella knew she'd messed up the second he asked. Her mouth had run faster than her brain -again. Now there was no rewinding.


Since she couldn't walk it back, she figured she might as well be honest.
They saw each other at the institute nearly every day. She couldn't keep walking on eggshells around him.


She took a deep breath, sat up straighter,and looked him in the eye. "Mr. Briggs, I just feel like... you've got a bit of a bias against me.It makes things really difficult whenever you're around."


William held her gaze, the corners of his mouth lifting ever so slightly. "When have I ever made things difficult for you?"


So first she'd called him blind. Now she was accusing him of being her source of anxiety.


Bold. But that little flash of courage quickly fizzled out when she met his cool, unreadable eyes.He was far too calm.


Stella instantly shrunk back, eyes darting toward the window. "Forget I said anything,Mr.Briggs. Just... pretend I was rambling."


She pressed herself against the car door like
the window might let her escape. No way she was risking another accidental brush.


William watched her for a beat,something close to a smile on his face.


Stella really was more interesting than he'd expected.


Then, casually, he said, "Ms. Russell, you took my measurements earlier. So the suit should fit perfectly this time, right?"


His voice had the faintest teasing edge to it.Stella blinked. Wait, what? Hadn't he told her not to waste her time on "trivial" things like that?


Was he changing his mind now?


Was he expecting another suit-equal value,custom-fitted?
###Chapter 61 Complete Collapse




Stella stared out the window, quietly turning his words over in her mind. She'd been lost in thought for a while, and just as she was about to speak, the car rolled to a gentle stop.


She glanced over at him, only to hear him say calmly, "We've arrived at the research institute's dormitory, Ms. Russell. Please take care."



The way he said it-polite and distant-left her with no room to ask anything further. Stella had no choice but to hold back the question on the tip of her tongue.


It was clear he was politely drawing the line, and pressing him now would only come off as rude.


So she simply lowered her head, whispered a soft thank you, and stepped out of the car without another word.


When she returned to the dorm, Lainey was still
awake. The moment she heard the door, she sat up, her eyes full of worry. "Hey, how did it go?Everything alright?"


Stella could tell Lainey had been worried."It went well," she said. "And honestly, if you hadn't fixed my recorder, I couldn't have shown everyone that Haley framed me."


Haley and Marc were probably having a rough time at the police station right now.


Even if they managed to walk out later, their reputations were already in shambles. Once she filed for divorce, the truth behind it would be out in the open.


As for the patent, Marc could forget about it.That ship had sailed, and his troubles were only just getting started.


Lainey waved her hand like it was no big deal."Please, those two snakes deserve everything coming to them."



In fact, Lainey thought this was letting them off
easy. If she had her way, they'd be skinned alive.


Stella chuckled at how fired up Lainey was. As she changed clothes, she asked casually, "Hey,why didn't you tell me that Mr. Briggs was the one behind the company I signed with?"


Lainey blinked. "Wait, what are you talking about?"


Stella gave her a look. "The company that offered me the new contract-it's under the Briggs Group."


Lainey gawked at her, totally floored-just as stunned as Stella had been when she found out earlier.


Stella had assumed Lainey was already aware,but it was obvious now that she had no clue.


"Oh my god! William? You're working with him?|seriously had no idea!" Lainey gasped. "I only knew the rep seemed generous and professional over the phone. They felt legit, so l
told you to go for it. I didn't know he was behind the whole thing."


She truly hadn't realized it was linked to William.If she had, she might've thought twice and definitely would've given Stella a heads-up.


Stella didn't actually mind-it just felt a little awkward. But since Lainey clearly hadn't known, Stella waved it off and said it didn't matter. As long as the partnership worked out,that was all that mattered.


Lainey agreed quickly. "Honestly, they're offering a much better deal. This will be way more worthwhile than anything Marc ever gave you."


When it came to business, Lainey felt she could count on William to be fair and professional.


"By the way," Lainey began, "you're all over the internet right now. After what happened at the gala, everyone's talking about how Marc stole your patent. Looks like Briggs Group is getting
ready to take legal action, and the compensation alone might bankrupt him."


Marc's company had only grown because of Stella's invention.



So when the news broke that the patent was no longer his to use, his business partners didn't waste a second-they pulled out.


Earlier today, Marc had been trying to line up new investors. But after the scandal, no one in Choria wanted anything to do with him.


Covering the compensation fees now would be nearly impossible for him.


At this rate, he'd have no choice but to mortgage the company, maybe even lose it entirely. That would be the end of the Walsh Group.


Stella hadn't heard something this satisfying in a long time.



And Lainey wasn't done yet. "As for Haley-she
thought she could get away with anything just because she's not from around here. But the authorities aren't letting it slide. She's probably headed to jail."


With two nations involved, the whole thing had become a diplomatic issue, not something that could be brushed under the rug.


Letting Haley off the hook just like that would damage the government's credibility.


Even if it was only for show, they couldn't afford to go easy on her.


Meanwhile, Stella stepped out of the shower,feeling clean and much more at ease. The steady chirping of cicadas outside created the kind of calm that made sleep come easy.


She curled up in bed, tugged the blanket over her, and shut her eyes with a quiet sense of peace.


The chaos and hurt she'd been through finally ended today. She had taken her stand-and
Won.


While Stella and Lainey slept peacefully, Marc was having a far rougher night.
###Chapter 62 Blaming Each Other




Since the police needed a full account of the incident, they began by interviewing everyone separately before moving on to a joint session.


Frightened by the thought of prison, Jazlyn broke down and confessed everything.


"Officer, I swear | didn't know Haley had arranged for anyone to hurt Stella. She told me it was just about staging some fake photos.I wasn't thinking straight, I only wanted to push Stella into leaving my son. I never intended for anyone to get hurt!"


Her face was earnest as she spoke, and in an effort to prove her innocence, she even handed over her message history with Haley as evidence.


The messages did, in fact, mention nothing beyond staging a few photos to smear Stella's
image.


One of the officers glanced at Jazlyn with clear disapproval. "Even if you wanted to break them up, there are legal ways to go about it. She's your daughter-in-law, and you still agreed to this?"


What she'd done was criminal.



Now consumed by regret, Jazlyn couldn't believe she'd trusted someone like Haley. She had hoped Marc would move on to someone more suitable, but instead, he had become entangled with someone far worse.


"Officer, I see now how wrong I was. It was that woman, she kept filling my head with lies, telling me Stella wasn't good enough. I was foolish to believe her. I swear, I'll never let something like this happen again!"


Once the officers saw she had nothing more to add, they had her escorted out and brought Haley and Marc in for questioning, one at a
time.


After the initial interviews, the three of them were placed together in a single room.



"I've gone over each of your statements," the officer announced. "I'll read them aloud now. If everything is correct, you'll each sign."


As the officer began reading, Marc's face grew darker with every word.



He shot a furious look at Haley, who sat beside him in silence. "It really was you," he snapped."What gave you the right to drag Stella into something like this?"


Marc had already made his stance clear, his involvement with Haley was nothing serious. He might entertain himself outside, but Stella would always be his wife.


As long as Haley didn't interfere with Stella, he was content to let her remain by his side.



But she had gone too far.
Haley, meanwhile, was Tar too pieuccupicu vvid.the fear of jail time to pay attention to Marc's fury.


Marc's anger built steadily, not just toward Haley for disregarding his warning, but also toward Stella.


She had gone and handed her patent to the Briggs Group, knowing full well his company was struggling to renew their contracts.


And now she was showing up at formal events with William by her side.


What exactly was going on between them?


"I need to leave. I had no involvement in this at any point, I wasn't part of any of it! I need to get out now!"


What he really wanted was to find Stella, to confront her, to understand why she had suddenly shut him out so completely, and to uncover what kind of connection she had with William.

"Once everything is on record and fully admitted," the officer said, "you'll be free to gO."


The officer continued reading aloud.


Once he finished, he looked up. "Any objections to the statement?"


Haley was quick to react, lifting her hand. "Yes,Officer. I already said earlier, this whole scheme was Jazlyn's idea. She was the one calling the shots. I just followed her instructions. I had nothing to do with planning any of it!"


She had lied earlier during her individual questioning, and now she stuck to the same false story.


"So you're saying Jazlyn directed you. Do you have anything to prove that?"



Haley hesitated for a moment before launching into a response. "How would I have proof? She told me face to face that she didn't want her daughter-in-law around anymore. She said to find some men to assault her-I remember her
saying that exactly!"


The officer gave her a flat look, clearly unconvinced, and let out a quiet, humorless laugh.


"You're offering nothing to support your claim,while Jazlyn's chat history only mentions a staged photo shoot. Nothing else is suggested."


"She must've deleted the rest, I swear she did!"Haley doubled down without a second thought.


But her account was riddled with contradictions.


First, she insisted the conversation happened in person, leaving no evidence, then suddenly, she claimed Jazlyn had deleted messages.


The inconsistency made it obvious she was lying.


"You're making things up! | didn't delete a single thing. We came to the station without warning,how would I even have time to erase chat logs?"
Jazlyn snapped, her voice sharp witn frustration.


She was beginning to see Haley for who she truly was calculating, and willing to throw anyone under the bus to save herself.


All those moments of feigned affection, the promises to be like family, they had all been empty words.



"What exactly did I lie about? Are you seriously going to claim you've never had a problem with Stella? Weren't you the one who told me to put her in her place?" Haley shot back, not flinching.


Overwhelmed by the situation, Jazlyn broke down in tears right there at the police station shouting that Haley was a heartless and cruel woman.


"Marc, please, you have to believe me. I would never tell her to do something like that to Stella.| swear | didn't!" Through her sobs, Jazlyn
begged Marc to believe she was telling the truth.


She wiped at her face, her eyes scanning the room in desperation.



While Haley was the one who escalated the situation and turned a staged setup into something real, it had been Jazlyn who originally floated the idea of punishing Stella.


She had planted the seed from the beginning.


As the investigation progressed, it became increasingly clear that the truth wasn't going to favor her.



Both women had played roles in the scheme,and now each was scrambling to shift the blame and protect herself.



Meanwhile, Marc's thoughts kept circling back to Stella-where she might have gone after everything, and whether she had left with William.
He made up his mind on the spot, he had to go after her right away.
###Chapter 63 Secret Personnel




Marc looked the officer dead in the eye,frustration brimming in his voice. "Let me out, or I'll have my lawyer contact you."


The officer didn't even flinch. "You're welcome to call your lawyer, but it won't change the fact -you're not going anywhere tonight. You're under investigation for intellectual property infringement. The opposing company's already submitted evidence. Until we sort this out,you stay put."


That was the final nail in the coffin. Marc leaned back in the hard chair, jaw tight. He had planned to go find Stella, to talk to her, maybe even fix things.


Now? That hope was crushed.



To make things worse, Jazlyn and Haley were still crying beside him. Their constant sniffles
and dramatic sobs grated on his nerves.


He suddenly slammed his hand on the table."Enough already! What are you even crying for?You two worked together to hurt Stella, didn't you?"


The outburst silenced them both. Jazlyn choked on her sobs.



Haley glared at him, lips trembling.


She didn't get it. Why was everything going Stella's way? First, Stella married Marc. Then William showed up, practically shielding her from harm.


Haley was almost certain William had intervened and ruined her entire plan.



Why was Stella always the lucky one? Why did men like Marc and William gravitate toward her?


Marc-who used to be so gentle with Haley-had been cold and irritable with her all day. The injustice burned inside her.
The next morning, the sun rose on what should've been a milestone day at the institute -the start of the confidential research project.


The institute's lobby buzzed with activity.Selected members stood with their luggage,excited and proud. Those not chosen came to see them off.


Stella stood to one side, quietly watching it all.She was calm on the surface, but her eyes betrayed her disappointment.


She'd poured so much into this project, fully believing her skills and dedication would earn her a spot. But in the end, she had overestimated herself.


Now, she could only watch the others chase a dream she thought would be hers.



Her suitcase was already packed. Not for the project-but for something far more personal.She had made up her mind to step away and
sort out the divorce.


Last night's drama had drawn enough attention,and she needed space. She had already informed the institute of her planned leave.Her superiors didn't object. After the project team departed, she walked into the office and handed in her leave request.


Her supervisor looked at her kindly. "Stella,sometimes a break is a good thing. Come back when you're ready."


She forced a smile and nodded.



The supervisor saw the disappointment lingering in her expression and patted her shoulder. "Don't be too hard on yourself. There will always be other chances."


"I know," she said softly. "I'll get going, then."



Dragging her suitcase behind her, she made her way out.


Heading toward the exit of the institute, she saw
Lainey bursting in.


Lainey spotted her, sprinted over, and grabbed her hand, out of breath and wide-eyed.


"Stella! Don't go out-Marc's at the institute gate. He's making a huge scene!"


Stella froze.Marc?


With all the charges against him, how could he be out already?


Was he here because of what happened last night at the gala? Maybe he wanted to get back at her.



"Who knows what kind of tricks he pulled to get out so fast!" Lainey muttered, clearly shaken.


Lainey didn't want Stella to go out. Marc had once hit her. Who knew what he was capable of now?



Suddenly, a strong hand gripped the handle of Stella's suitcase and yanked it back.
###Chapter 64 Do l Look Blind




Stella froze for a second. She turned and found it was WVilliam. He was now walking toward the garage.


He took a few steps before realizing she wasn't behind him. Turning around with a slight frown,he asked, "Aren't you coming?"


She was momentarily at a loss. Wasn't he supposed to have left with the project team?Why was he still here?


Mind reeling with questions, Stella followed him to the parking lot, where she watched him effortlessly lift her suitcase with one hand and place it in the trunk.


He opened the driver's side door but glanced back at her before getting in.


"Get in." Two words, low and firm. Not a request.A command.

Stella hesitated but finally climbed into the passenger seat. After all, her suitcase was already held hostage.


"Mr. Briggs, weren't you supposed to leave with the project team? Why are you..."


She trailed off. She wanted to ask why he was here and where he was taking her.



The questions were stacking, but William didn't seem eager to answer.


Instead, he fired up the engine, and the car shot forward like a bullet.



As they sped past the institute's gates, Stella spotted Marc out front, pacing like a man possessed. Her heart jumped, and she instinctively turned her face away from the window.


The silence inside the car grew thick. She occasionally glanced at William, who was focused on driving, as if she wasn't even there.
Stella tried to break the silence. "Mr. Briggs, did you see Marc out there?"


William didn't even glance at her. "Do I look blind to you?"



She blinked, caught off guard. "Sorry."


He let out a dry, humorless laugh, as though her apology was pointless.


She wasn't the one who invited Marc there. Why was she apologizing?



Stella exhaled, her voice low. "If I hadn't gone to that charity event last night, maybe he wouldn't have shown up today."



She didn't regret confronting Marc-only the trouble it brought to everyone else.


That guilt weighed heavier than her own anger.



"That's very. considerate of you," William said with a soft chuckle, but his tone made her wonder if he was mocking her.

Stella fell silent. She didn't even ask where they were headed. She figured wherever it was, he probably wasn't driving her off a cliff. -


The stoplight ahead turned red. As the countdown ticked, William finally spoke again."The core project members' names aren't public. For confidentiality. The list that went out was only partial."


Stella blinked. Her breath hitched. She stared at him.



Was he saying...?


"You mean... I'm on the confidential list?" she asked, voice rising slightly.


William didn't answer, only hit the gas when the light turned green.


But Stella leaned forward, eyes shining with hope. "I'm willing to join. Are we heading to the team now?"


No matter what role she was assigned, she was
eager to join the team.


He gave a soft "Mm" in response. Then added casually, "But if you join... have you thought about what to do with your husband?"



She tensed.William continued, "He's not going to let this go. Especially now that you didn't show."


Stella leaned back slowly, her voice calm but cold. "I'm done with him. I've signed the divorce papers. Once I'm on the project team, I'll erase every trace ofmyself. Let him think I'm dead for all I care. Let him regret it for the rest of his life."


William gave her a sidelong glance.Letting Marc believe she was dead?



That was... intense.



Still,he couldn't help but raise an eyebrow.


Stella stared out the window, watching the scenery blur past. "Besides, he has bigger problems. The patent theft, the stuff with Haley
-he'll be too busy dealing with that mess to even think about me."


Her voice had a trace of satisfaction. It was ironic,really.


Haley had tried to destroy her, and in the end,she'd dragged Marc down with her.


Someone as selfish as Marc wouldn't have come today unless he thought it served his interests.


The thought made Stella chuckle coldly


William glanced her way, taking her in. There was something new in his eyes-something closer to recognition.


She definitely wasn't the naive woman people mistook her for.



When she decided to be tough, she didn't just dip her toe in-she dove straight into the fire.


And strangely, William admired that about her.
Blind submission was dull. Mindless rebellion?Just exhausting.


But Stella struck a rare balance-soft where it mattered, sharp where it counted.


She'd clearly learned where the line was-and when to cross it.



After a moment, he spoke again. "Don't worry about Marc. The institute will deal with him."


Stella blinked at him but didn't question it.



Whoever handled Marc... he was no longer her problem.


Back at the institute's entrance, Marc was still yelling,demanding to see Stella.


He knew she was still in there-she hadn't returned home.


His eyes were wild. His fists slammed against the gate. "If she doesn't come out,| swear-l'll tear this whole damn place down!"








###Chapter 65 It Was Satisfying




Marc had spent the entire night locked up at the police station. He hadn't even bothered to change clothes before storming over to the institute in a frenzy to find Stella.


Too bad for him-the guards at the gate weren't letting him take a single step past the entrance, leaving him no choice but to shout from outside.


His shouting got so obnoxious that it finally drew out a man in a tailored suit and sleek glasses, clearly someone important.


"I need to see Stella Russell! Get her out here, now!" Marc barked, not caring who he was yelling at.


The man didn't flinch. "Stella's not here. And if you keep this up, I'll call the police." His tone was calm but firm, the kind that didn't invite negotiation.


Marc's face twisted in anger, irritated by the
man's poise. "Who the hell are you?"


Seeing Marc's unreasonable behavior, the man introduced himself as Paul Hoffman, the director of the institute.



"Stella is my employee," he added. "She submitted a leave request this morning and left. Where she went isn't my concern-and it's certainly not yours."


To prove his point, Paul pulled out Stella's handwritten leave note and showed it to Marc.


Marc stared at the familiar handwriting,suddenly unsure of himself.


He had been so sure she'd still be here-where else could she have gone?


Paul didn't wait for a response. He turned and walked back inside, casually instructing security to call the police if Marc caused any more trouble.


Marc flinched. After spending the night in a holding cell, the last thing he wanted was
another trip back. Now that he knew Stella wasn't here, he had no choice but to slink away, humiliated.


Back in the Maybach, Stella burst into quiet laughter as William explained that Paul had personally handled Marc.


The image of Marc being tossed out like a stray dog? Utterly satisfying.



After all his self-righteous posturing,watching him crash and burn was the sweetest kind of justice.


William caught the laughter in her eyes and immediately knew-she was thinking about Marc. His gaze darkened, the corners of his mouth tightening.


"The project's demanding," he said coolly. "If your head's still stuck on personal drama,maybe it's better you stay home and play house."


Stella's smile vanished as she straightened up. "Mr. Briggs, don't worry. The moment join the project team, I'm all in. No
distractions. I'll be focused-completely."


Her tone was firm, eyes unwavering. She was dead serious. If she'd had to swear on it, she would've.



Having made her decision, she was determined to follow through, leaving the past behind and pursuing a better future.


William seemed satisfied. A faint smirk tugged at the corner of his lips as he focused on the road. From Stella's angle, she caught a glimpse of his sharp jawline-clean, strong like it had been sculpted.


She hated to admit it, but he really was unfairly good-looking. She used to think Marc was attractive, but now? William made Marc look like a dollar-store knockoff.


That sudden comparison made her cringe.She quickly shook her head to banish the thought.


They arrived at the project base-a hidden facility tucked into the side of a mountain.William cut the engine and nodded at her to
get out.


She took a deep breath before stepping out of the car.



The others were already neck deep in work,and since she'd arrived later than the rest,she was directed through the back entrance.



As a core team member, her identity was confidential. Regular staff didn't even know she existed.


There were five core members in total,herself included. She hadn't met any of them before now.


When they stood together for the first time,the air was polite but stiff.


No one really knew each other. No one knew what to expect.



"Once you get to know each other, feel free to choose any dorm," the team leader addressed them.


Stella scanned the group and gave a brief nod to the two other women, but she wasn't
picky.


A bed was a bed-she just chose one and got on with it.



They were expected to dive straight into work. Their first task was to head into the surrounding mountains and collect biological specimens for research.


Before leaving, Stella buried herself in the project files, scanning every detail to familiarize herself with the mission.


Just as she slung her backpack over her shoulder, ready to head out, the team leader stopped her to inform her she had a partner."Your partner's waiting. Men's dormitory,room 305."
###Chapter 66 Do You Want Help Washing Your Back 




Stella followed the directions to the room and stopped at the door. She reached out to knock,but the door opened easily with just a gentle push.


A bit thrown off, she stepped inside cautiously."Excuse me..."



She barely got the words out when her eyes landed on William-he was in the middle of a shower, the bathroom door wide open.



Her breath hitched. Just as she turned to leave,William turned toward her.


Their eyes locked, and Stella wished the floor would swallow her whole.


"What brings you here?" His expression was tight, clearly caught off guard by her presence.
Flustered, Stella stammered, "I... I am your partner. We need to collect some samples."


William paused for a beat, then nodded and told her to give him a moment.


Stella stood frozen, struggling to stop her gaze from drifting toward his defined frame. Before she could stop herself, the words slipped out."Do you want help washing your back?"


It felt wrong to let that strong, sculpted back go to waste.



The second the sentence left her mouth, regret kicked in hard, especially when she noticed William looking at her with a strange,unreadable look.


Her heart thudded, and she quickly tried to fix the situation. "Wait, Mr. Briggs, I didn't mean anything weird. Really. It's just... I figuredd it must be hard to scrub your back alone, and if l helped,you'd finish faster..."


She meant to sound helpful, but each word
made things worse. The awkwardness thickened in the air, and William's expression only grew colder.


She wished she could take it all back. What was she even saying?


Was she seriously implying she wanted to join him in the shower?



William emerged from the bathroom, a towvel tied around his waist.



The sight of his broad, chiseled torso made Stella's breath catch again. Without thinking,she slapped both hands over her eyes. "Mr.Briggs, what are you thinking? Y-you might want to put something on!"


After all, they were a man and a woman, alone in the room, and he hadn't fully dressed yet-it simply felt improper.


William said nothing as he stepped toward her,his calm presence contrasting with the visible panic on her face.
But instead of touching her, his hand reached past her shoulder.


Stella's eyes widened as he closed the distance.She backed away instinctively to avoid contact.



Embarrassment overwhelmed her, and all she wanted to do was flee, but before she could,William had already reached for the bathrobe hanging just behind her.


He slipped it on just as Stella lost her footing and tumbled backward.



Startled, William moved quickly, catching her before she hit the floor.


Stella's arms flailed in panic, and in the process,she accidentally yanked at the robe, tearing it halfway off his body.


His arm slid around her waist to steady her,pulling her against him without meaning to.



His skin was cool from the shower, damp against her warm cheeks, which were now
burning with embarrassment.


Stella felt her heart drop.



Whenever she attempted to clarify things with him,it always seemed to go wrong.


The last time, she somehow wound up on his lap during a formal event, and now, she found herself in his arms again, with him barely dressed.


For a moment, she froze in place, completely forgetting to move.


William looked down at her, an amused glint in his eyes. "Ms. Russell, you seem awfully settled in my arms. Are you not planning to move?"



Stella's entire face turned crimson. She scrambled to free herself. "No, it's not like that -wait!"


As she shifted, she felt a tug and realized, too late, that her clothes had caught on his towel.


In one horrifying second, the towel slipped-and
William, once decently wrapped, now stood completely exposed before her at painfully close range.
###Chapter 67 She Misunderstood





Stella wanted to vanish from sheer.embarrassment until she realized he was wearing pants the whole time.


So... she'd completely misunderstood the situation.



Pressed against his chest, she could hear his steady heartbeat-calm, firm, and totally opposite to her own, which was racing like crazy.


From this close, she picked up the clean,faint scent of his body wash. It wasn't overpowering-just smooth and refined, like it belonged to him.


William reached over her to grab the clothes,and when he finally stepped back, Stella felt like she could breathe again, as if light had returned to the room.


She quickly stepped back, this time carefully.
"I'll wait outside, Mr. Briggs. Just let me know when you're done," she said, then turned and walked out without glancing back.


Outside, she exhaled deeply and patted her chest like she was trying to calm her nerves.That had been way too much for one day.


About ten minutes later, William stepped out,perfectly dressed and once again looking like the cool, collected version of himself.


"Mr. Briggs, we're scheduled to collect some samples outside. Shall we go now?" Stella asked,putting on her professional tone.


William gave a small nod and began walking beside her, his pace steady and purposeful.


Compared to before, he seemed completely unbothered now.


As she followed his tall, straight figure, Stella thought maybe he hadn't taken the earlier awkward moment seriously after all.


While her nerves were still tight, William seemed completely calm, as if nothing had
shaken him at all.


This was their first official assignment at the research institute, and thankfully, collecting the samples turned out to be pretty easy. In about an hour, they were done and headed back.


With the day's work wrapped up, everyone at the institute gathered for dinner in the cafeteria.


As usual, gossip filled the room. Someone whispered, "Did you hear? There's still one more person who hasn't shown up for the project."


Stella looked up curiously, wondering who they were talking about.



"Apparently, it's some genius who studied overseas. And get this-rumor has it she and Mr. Briggs had a thing. Maybe she's avoiding coming here to skip the drama," the gossip continued.


That surprised Stella. She always thought someone like William wouldn't be interested
in romance.


The person added, "They say there's still something going on between them. Like,maybe neither of them moved on."


Stella looked down and poked at her food,suddenly feeling a little guilty.


Even though what happened earlier wasn't on purpose, it looked like she might've caused some trouble for William.


Maybe she should find a moment to apologize once dinner was over.



Thinking that, she finished her meal a bit faster until she heard footsteps and voices approaching from the hallway.


Looking up, Stella saw a graceful-looking woman surrounded by a few people walking past them.


They were carrying bags-it looked like she had just arrived.


Strangely, Stella had a feeling-no proof, just a gut instinct that this was the woman from
the rumors. The one William liked.


Although she'd never seen her before,something just told her it had to be her.



Stella kept watching as the woman walked away, her eyes lingering on her back for a long while.


It was a pity she hadn't gotten a look at the woman's face-just her silhouette.



"If Mr. Briggs likes her, she must be really stunning," someone nearby commented.


"I honestly thought he didn't have feelings for anyone," another person chimed in."Every time I look at him, it's like staring at an ice statue. Who would've thought he's actually been carrying a torch for someone this whole time? That's some real dedication."


Stella quietly held her fork, her gaze drifting over to William, who was sitting calmly at another table.
###Chapter 68 She's Gone 



Stella kept a close eye on William's face-and bingo, there it was. William's expression darkened, a clear flicker of anger flashing in his eyes.


Yep, she thought. That classy woman who had just walked by? Definitely his ex.Probably the one who still had a hold on him -the one he couldn't have.


Stella clicked her tongue.



Being in the same place, seeing someone you once cared about but couldn't be with?That had to sting.



For a brief moment, she felt a little sorry for him.


Meanwhile, William was quietly focused on his meal when a prickle of instinct told him he was being watched.


He glanced up-and sure enough, there she
was. Stella. She wasn't even trying to hide it,either. Her eyes sparkled with mischief, her expression the definition of amused curiosity -like she was watching a particularly juicy episode of a drama, and he was the main act.


His face turned stormy in an instant.


What was he, some reality show for her entertainment?


He said nothing, just quietly finished his meal.


Once he finished, he picked up his tray and strode past her table. Just as he passed by,he leaned in slightly and said in a cool,almost lazy tone, "Ms. Russell, it appears that your appetite is limited at the moment.However, without sufficient energy reserves,it may be challenging for you to help washing my back."


Stella choked on her own breath. She turned beet red before she could even think of a comeback-but William was already gone,
striding away like nothing had happened.


Her colleagues, having overheard William's remark, immediately turned their curious gazes toward Stella.


"What are you helping him with, Stella?" one asked,eyebrows raised in intrigue.


Caught completely off guard, Stella froze with her fork mid-air. Her face flushed so quickly it feIt like she'd stepped into a sauna.Was William trying to embarrass her?


"Is it some kind of... intense task?" another added, a little too innocently. "You know-physically demanding?"


Her colleagues, completely unaware of her embarrassment, kept pressing.



All Stella could do was shake her head,cheeks still warm, trying to explain that William was just making a joke.


But-joking?



Everyone around the table exchanged looks,like they'd just heard the most absurd thing
imaginable.


The man barely spoke to anyone, let alone joked. If he was suddenly joking with Stella...what did that mean? Was something going on between them?


Stella managed to finish up her meal amidst the barrage of questions, and finally made it back to her dorm.


She showered, threw on something comfortable, and flopped onto her bed. The mattress was firm, but honestly, she felt better than she had in weeks.


Leaving Marc had been the best decision she'd ever made.


Before moving here, she'd switched phones and numbers. Marc could try all he wanted-he wasn't going to find her.


In a few days, she'd probably be declared missing.


Her name would vanish from any traceable records.
It'd be like she'd never existed.


Turning on her phone, Stella opened WhatsApp and saw a message from Lainey.


"Stella, where did you go? Marc showed up at the institute again today, raising hell.Security had to step in to get him to leave.Also, since finding out you left, he's been searching everywhere in Choria-posting missing person notices, writing these long sob stories online. It's pathetic. He's just trying to play the victim again."


Stella burst out laughing. She didn't even need to look-she could already picture Marc making a spectacle of himself, pretending to be some tragic, abandoned lover.


Of course, Lainey didn't know where she was now. No one did.


The base's strict confidentiality protocols ensured that. And that was exactly how Stella wanted it. She hesitated for a moment,thumbs hovering over the reply box.


Even if Lainey meant well, one slip was all it
would take for Marc to track her down.


The best-kept secrets were the ones kept from everyone.


Still, she felt a twinge of guilt for worrying her friend. But this... this was the only way.


With a soft sigh, she turned off her phone and let sleep take her.


Meanwhile, Marc was going out of his mind.He'd turned the city upside down-sent people to dig through every possible lead.And still, nothing.


It was like she had disappeared into thin air.



He'd always thought she'd never really leave him. That she'd eventually come crawling back. So he didn't take her seriously-until now.


Now she was gone. No message. Just gone.


He'd called her a thousand times, but her phone stayed off.


Back at the villa, everything felt colder. The
warm light she used to leave on for him? Off.


Desperate, he rummaged through her stuff-maybe she'd just taken a break, maybe she'd be back.


But when he opened the closet, reality hit hard. Most of her clothes were gone.
###Chapter 69 Asking His Assistant




Although the jewelry Marc had once bought for Stella still sat untouched, every single piece she had brought with her was now gone.


He suddenly remembered Stella mentioning that she had sold off a lot of her things.A bit unsettled, he picked up his phone and quickly made a call to confirm. But the person on the other end sounded confused."No," they said. "I haven't received anything from your wife to sell."


Marc's stomach dropped. A cold realization hit him.



She hadn't sold them-she'd taken them with her.


His gaze wandered around the room,eventually landing on the now-empty frame that used to hold their wedding photo. For a moment, his heart skipped a beat. He
grabbed his phone again and dialed another number. "Hi. Can you check if my wife sent in our wedding photo for restoration sometime recently?"


"Mr. Walsh, we looked into it. There's no request under your name. We haven't received anything from you or your wife."


The phone slipped from Marc's hand and fell to the floor with a dull thud.



She hadn't sent it for restoration. So, what had she done with it?



Without wasting another second, he rushed downstairs to the garden. There, tucked away in a corner, was the same metal basin Stella had used the last time-when she was burning something.


That day, he had been in such a rush to sleep with Haley that he hadn't bothered to ask what Stella was burning.


Kneeling beside the basin now, he began sifting through the charred remains. It didn't take long before his fingers brushed against
a small, partially burned fragment.


He picked it up, and his breath caught in his throat. It was a torn piece of their wedding photo.


Most of it was blackened and scorched,but he could still make out the hem of Stella's white dress.


There was no mistaking it-it was their photo.


That day... she had been burning their wedding photo.



She had looked him in the eye and told him it was just trash.


Trash? That was what she had called it.


And where had he been? With Haley.Laughing. Forgetting all about the woman who had once been his everything.


Regret slammed into Marc like a wave. His pulse raced, and his mind reeled.


What had he done? What had he done to
her?


Later, he slumped onto the sofa, lighting cigarette after cigarette, sinking into a pit of silent misery.


Stella had always hated it when he smoked.Because of her, he rarely ever lit one in the house. But now, with no one around to stop him, he found no comfort in it-only bitterness.


Eventually, he tossed the lighter and cigarette pack on the table and sat there,burying his face in his hands. He rubbed his temples slowly, as if trying to ease the weight of guilt pressing down on him.


Then, suddenly, he remembered the last gift Stella had given him-a safe.


She hadn't shared the combination, only saying she'd tell him when the time was right, calling it a surprise.


He sprang up from the sofa like a man possessed, headed straight to the storage room, and pulled out the dusty safe.
Marc stared at the combination lock and tried everything he could think of-his birthday, the day he and Stella first got together, even their wedding anniversary.


But none of them worked.



Just then, one of the house staff who had been quietly observing his efforts hesitated,then spoke up in a low voice. "Mr. Walsh,maybe it's Mrs. Walsh's birthday?"


The suggestion hit him like a punch to the gut. Stella had said once, offhandedly, that the password might be her birthday.


But now that he actually needed it-he couldn't remember when her birthday was.


His face darkened in frustration. He waved the servant away without a word, and the poor man quickly slipped out of the room,sensing the storm brewing.


Marc tried again, using random guesses,but the safe stayed stubbornly locked.


Stella was different from Haley; she rarely
asked him for anything on her birthday, not even gifts.


She had always acted like it didn't matter,and he had believed her. He thought she'd be happy with whatever he gave her,whenever he remembered.



Now he sat there, fumbling with the lock like a fool, and realized he hadn't remembered at all. His jaw clenched in self-directed anger as he grabbed his phone and dialed his assistant,Kody.


He vaguely recalled telling Kody to send Stella birthday gifts every year in his name.



So now, with a dry voice, he asked, "When's Stella's birthday?"



On the other end, Kody answered groggily,clearly woken from sleep. He was silent for a moment, caught off guard.



Marc had spent the past few days searching desperately for Stella, even putting out a missing person notice.
He acted like a man madly in love, yet now he didn't even remember her birthday?




Kody couldn't make sense of it. Stella was Marc's wife. How could he not know something so basic and personal? And why was he asking his assistant for it?
###Chapter 70 Really Cold




Kody found the whole situation a little ridiculous, but since Marc was his boss, he kept his sarcasm in check and simply told the latter Stella's birthday.


Funny thing was, Kody always had to be the one reminding Marc about her birthday.Eventually, Marc just passed the entire responsibility off to him-picking the gifts,getting the cake, even delivering everything.


So, naturally, Kody remembered the date better than Marc ever did-no need for notes.


Marc ended the call and stared at the safe.His hands were clammy as he punched in the code. Click. The lock released with a soft sound, and the lid sprang open.


He had no idea what Stella might've left inside, but this-this safe-was the last thing that connected them. His last shot at finding
some kind of clue. Some kind of hope.


Inside, there was just a single folder lying there quietly.



His heart sank before he even touched it.He reached in, fingers brushing the smooth paper, and slid the folder out. He'd barely pulled a third of it free when the words "Divorce Agreement" jummped out at him.


His breath caught. His hand trembled, and the folder slipped from his grasp, scattering papers all over the floor.


His eyes locked onto the last page-Stella's signature, written in that familiar, graceful handwriting.


So this was her surprise? She had already signed the divorce papers.


He thought back to the odd look on her face when she handed him the safe. Back then,he'd brushed it off, thinking she was just hiding something silly.


Turns out she was hiding her exit plan.
She had planned to leave him since then...while he was still busy thinking his affair with Haley was well-covered.


Marc's heart twisted, a sharp, suffocating pain tightening in his chest as he stared at the papers. His eyes reddened, but he didn't look away.







Meanwhile, Stella had been part of the project team for several days now. Every day she was out collecting samples, trekking through mountains and woods.


The samples changed daily, and the difficulty of finding them increased with each assignment.


In the beginning, she and Williamn could finish within an hour. Now? Sometimes they'd search for hours and still come back empty-handed.


Stella knew it would only get harder from here.
Aware of the growing challenge, the team had assigned a few more colleagues to join her and William on today's search.


They were all hunched over, combing through the woods, but after a while, it was clear they were coming up short.


Stella stood still, flipping through the reference materials again.



Today's target had a few very specific traits -it thrived in moisture, hated sunlight, and always grew in damp environments.



She ran through the facts in her head, then looked up and said, "Let's try the riverbank."


Her teammates blinked at her.



"The river? It's a half-hour hike from here,"one of them complained. "And we haven't finished searching this area yet."


They were exhausted and frustrated, and nobody wanted to waste time on a hunch.


"I just think," Stella started, "based on its environmental needs, the river makes
sense."


But the doubtful expressions didn't fade.



"You think?" one woman scoffed. "If it's not there, we'll have wasted all that time. We're not here to chase guesses."


The words stung, leaving Stella a bit rattled.


Then William, who had been quietly standing behind them, spoke up. "We haven't checked the river yet. It's worth a look."


His calm, firm tone silenced the complaints.



He didn't raise his voice, but the others fell in line instantly. William was their senior-more experienced and definitely more intimidating.No one dared argue with him.


Grudgingly, someone muttered, "Fine. Let's go."


Stella glanced at William, a quiet thank-you in her eyes.


Without his help, the other team members wouldn't have listened to her.
As they walked side by side, she leaned a little closer and whispered, "Thanks."


William, as always, looked unmoved. "Don't thank me. I just want to find the sample quickly. If it's not there, don't expect help next time."



Then he walked off ahead,cold as ever.


Stella let out a breath and rubbed her nose,muttering to herself, "He's really got ice in his veins."


They eventually reached the river, the gentle gurgle of water greeting them. Stella rolled up her sleeves and got to work, carefully checking beneath mossy rocks.


The rocks were slippery and massive, and the ground uneven, but Stella kept going.



Then something caught her eye-a narrow cave opening, barely visible behind a cluster of rocks.



Her heart skipped.


It was dark, damp, secluded-exactly the
kind of place that plant would grow.


She crept closer and peeked inside. Sure enough, there it was. A rare, vibrant plant nestled in the shadows.


"It's here!" she shouted, excitement bubbling up.


But in her joy, she forgot to be careful. Her foot slid out from under her-in the blink of an eye, she tumbled straight down.
###Chapter 71 Shameless Behavior





"Careful!" A firm voice called out from behind, and before Stella could react, a hand reached out and steadied her just in time.



Her heart skipped a beat as she turned to see William standing there, his hand still loosely holding hers.


"Thanks," she murmured softly, her voice barely above a whisper.



As soon as she regained her balance, William let go without a word.



Just then, the rest of the group caught up,their eyes lighting up as they spotted the plant tucked in the shadows.



With William's brief assistance, Stella managed to carefully collect the plant.


"Finally! We've found it!" someone exclaimed.
The atmosphere lifted instantly, and any earlier doubts about Stella faded away.


One colleague walked up to her with a grin."Stella, you're incredible! I can't believe you actually found it here by the river!"


Stella was just about to explain that it was simply a coincidence when a cold, mocking laugh suddenly rang out from the back of the crowd.


She turned to find none other than Nathalia Fuller standing behind the group, with her arms crossed and eyes full of disdain.


Stella hadn't even realized Nathalia had tagged along.


With icy sarcasm, Nathalia sneered. "Ms.Russell, we're here to work, not to watch you throw yourself at men. That fall of yours-you planned it, didn't you? Just so William would catch you. Honestly, your behavior is downright shameless."


The accusation hit Stella like a slap. For a moment, she was stunned, completely
caught off guard.


What was Nathalia even talking about?



The rest of the team exchanged confused glances, no one quite understanding where Nathalia's anger was coming from.



Nathalia pushed her way through the crowd and stopped right in front of Stella. Her eyes narrowed as she looked at the plant in Stella's hand. "William must've told you the location, didn't he? He's the most experienced here. Let's not pretend you found this on your own."


Stella had no idea why Nathalia was so riled up, but she knew there was something complicated between her and William.


But who was chasing whom? From the look of it, Nathalia seemed to care more than William did.



Maybe seeing him help Stella had stirred some jealousy. Whatever it was, it clearly burned.
For a second, Stella was at a loss.


Stella was honestly at a loss for words. First,she'd been wrongly accused by Haley before even joining the project team, and now she was being dragged through the mud by William's so-called unattainable ideal.


Maybe she had been too quiet, too tolerant all this time-so much so that people thought they could walk all over her without consequence.


Without a word, Stella handed the plant to a colleague and stepped up to Nathalia.


"Miss Fuller, I don't know what kind of grudge you have against me, but let me make a few things clear. First, I found this spot on my own-it had nothing to do with Mr. Briggs. Second, I didn't fake that fall. The path is slippery. You were all a good fifteen feet behind me when it happened."


Stella hadn't thought William would catch up to her so quickly.


If she were really trying to pull some stunt,
she would've waited until he was right behind her. Doing it earlier would've been too risky-it made no sense.


She squared her shoulders and then added,"I came here to work, and I take this seriously. And if Mr. Briggs really knew the location all along, are you suggesting he just stood by and let everyone wander aimlessly?"


That shut Nathalia up right away.


If she pushed her argument any further,it would mean accusing William of deliberately watching everyone struggle.


Left with no comeback, Nathalia could only shoot daggers at Stella with furious eyes.


Stella quickly looked at William, thinking he might be upset that she spoke up, especially since Nathalia seemed important to him.


But to her surprise, he didn't look annoyed at all.



He stayed composed and unbothered,
ignoring Nathalia entirely.


The crowd stayed quiet, their eyes bouncing between the three of them, too nervous to say a word.
###Chapter 72 Seems To Be Kissing




William stepped forward, his voice calm but clear."Stella found the plant. There's a lot of moss around-everyone, be careful. Let's head back."


He didn't say much, but his words did two things-first, he gave Stella credit for finding the plant; second, he made it clear her fall was just an accident-not anyone's fault, but certainly not hers.


He didn't directly blame Nathalia, but the tone? It was unmistakable.


Nathalia stood frozen as William walked right past her without even a glance. Her heart sank.


He defended Stella.


He never used to speak up like that-especially not for someone else.


"Let's go, let's go! It's getting dark!"
The rest of the group urged one another to move. Stella stayed at the rear, gently tugged along by her colleagues, not sparing Nathalia a single look.


Behind them, Nathalia stomped her foot in frustration, seething silently.


Back at the institute's communal dining hall,everyone gathered for dinner. Stella sat with her usual group, and Laura Brooks, her roommate, plopped down beside her,practically buzzing with words of praise.


"Stella, you're seriously amazing," Laura beamed. "We searched all afternoon and came up with nothing. If it weren't for you,we'd still be out there in the dark!"


A few other team members chimed in, eyes filled with admiration.


"Yeah, how did you even know to check the river?"


The plants they had to search in the mountain were rare.
Stella gave a modest smile. "I just looked at its properties-it likes moisture and shade.The river made sense."


"Wow, that's impressive! We should all learn from you. "We've been going off pictures and merely matching appearances. You actually read the material?"


Stella shrugged with a soft chuckle. "It's just luck.You'll all get used to it with time."



She genuinely didn't feel like she did anything special. The guess had just paid off.


Laura sipped her soup, then suddenly remembered something. She leaned closer,whispering, "By the way... Did you know Nathalia and William used to be a thing?Back in the day. She went abroad for further studies, and their research took them in different directions. They split after that."


Stella hadn't heard a word of this.



Laura continued, "No one really knows who broke it off, but they've always been a bit...competitive. Kind of like rivals now."
Stella raised an eyebrow. William didn't strike her as someone who cared about rivalry.


But then again, what did she really know about him?


Laura gave her a reassuring pat. "I think you just got caught in their unresolved drama today. Nathalia might not've been aiming at you-she probably just can't stand William."


Stella nodded. It wasn't worth overthinking.



As long as Nathalia stayed out of her way,she had no interest in getting involved in their past.


After dinner, Stella headed back to the dorms for a shower. A day of hiking through woods meant one thing-dirt, sweat, and the desperate need to scrub it all off.


She was rubbing her sore neck and walking back when she suddenly froze at a corner. A man and a woman were standing close-too close.


William and Nathalia.
From where she stood, it looked like they were kissing-foreheads nearly touching,bodies close, heads tilted slightly. The whole scene screamed intimate.


Stella blinked, cheeks flushing with awkwardness. It felt wrong to stand there staring. She quickly turned around and took the long way back, heart thudding a little too fast.


But the reality was different. William was staring down at Nathalia, expression cold,brows slightly furrowed.


"Nathalia," he said flatly, "I'll say it one last time-I never agreed to be with you."


This misunderstanding had been dragging on for years. He'd ignored it for too long,but now that they were face-to-face again, he figured it was time to end it.


Nathalia looked up at him, her voice trembling. "I don't believe that. If I hadn't gone abroad, we would've been together,right?"
Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears, and she bit her lip, holding onto one last thread of hope.


William exhaled sharply, the beginning of a headache forming. "No. Even if you'd stayed,I still wouldn't have dated you. This has nothing to do with you leaving."


He had no idea where that rumor came from -about them being together and breaking up because of distance-but it wasn't even remotely true.


Nathalia's eyes reddened, her gaze refusing to accept his bluntness.


"I'm not interested in you, Nathalia," William said coolly. "I'm here to do research. I hope you are too. And I don't want to see anything like what happened today again."


He hated drama. Especially the kind built on false assumptions.



He turned to walk away, done with the conversation. But before he could take a step,Nathalia grabbed his arm. "Wait!"
And then, without warning-without hesitation-she closed her eyes and tiptoed up...and kissed him.
###Chapter 73 Love Can Make People Irrational




Nathalia refused to believe that William didn't feel anything for her. No-he had to.He was just too stubborn to admit it. If she pushed a little harder, maybe he'd stop pretending to be so distant.


But the moment she leaned in, lips barely brushing his-William's eyes widened. In a flash, his hand came up to block her.


Nathalia ended up kissing his hand. She froze. The next second, he pushed her back.



"Miss Fuller, get a grip on yourself."


Just one sentence-but they hit her harder than a slap.


She'd already thrown away her pride to take the first step. And still... he wouldn't even waver?



Her body swayed slightly, and the tears
she'd been holding back started to fall one by one.


William didn't even spare her another look.He turned and walked away. But just as he rounded the corner, he stopped. On the floor lay a familiar hair tie-blue, with a little star on it.


He bent down and picked it up, dusting it off with a thumb. He recognized it instantly.Stella's.


He'd teased her once about it-wasn't it too childish for her? Yet somehow, it suited her perfectly. Only Stella could pull off something so silly-looking and still make it seem natural.


He stared at it for a beat longer than necessary, then tucked it into his pocket.Something about it tugged at his heart.


That night, Stella showered, dried her hair,and curled up under the covers.



Her thoughts wandered back to the scene she'd accidentally witnessed earlier. William
and Nathalia... standing so close. From her angle, it really did look like they were kissing.She buried her face in the blanket and sighed. Can't those two be a little more discreet?


The next morning, Stella arrived early for breakfast. The cafeteria was still mostly empty, so she picked a quiet spot and began eating.


Halfway through, a familiar pair of clean,black shoes stopped right in front of her.She didn't need to look up to know who it was.William.


He sat down across from her, and her whole body stiffened.


Why did he choose this table when there were literally dozens of empty ones?



Was he out of his mind?


What she didn't know was that in his headd,it made perfect sense-they were in the same group. Might as well eat together and head out after.
But Stella didn't consider that. All she saw was Nathalia walking into the room. Without a second thought, she grabbed her tray and bolted like she'd just spotted a ghost.


She didn't want any part of their love triangle drama.


William's brow twitched. He hadn't even said anything.


Watching him now sitting alone, Nathalia made her move.


She grabbed her tray, walked over, and asked sweetly, "Mind if I sit here?"


William said nothing. So she sat.



She noticed his tray was mostly greens.Trying to seem considerate, she picked up her untouched chicken leg and moved her fork toward his plate.


William blocked it without hesitation. "Miss Fuller," he said calmly, "this is a research institute. I suggest you put more focus into your work. And please-don't worry about
my meals."


With that, he stood up and left, tray in hand.



Nathalia was left sitting there alone, appetite gone.


Her eyes trailed across the cafeteria until she spotted Stella at another table. She clenched her fists, then got up and headed straight toward her.


Stella was feeling pretty proud of herself for dodging disaster, until Nathalia sat down across from her. She braced herself, forcing a polite smile.


Nathalia, trying to look composed, said, "Ms.Russell, I hope you won't cling to William. He and I just have a few unresolved issues.That's no excuse for you to take advantage."


Stella blinked. Was this woman serious?



Which eye of hers had seen Stella "clinging"to anyone?


She calmly set down her fork and cleared her throat. "Miss Fuller, let me say this clearly:
have no interest in William. I'm here to work,not flirt with someone else's ex. I barely have time to sleep, let alone deal with jealousy games."


Nathalia's expression hardened, but she wasn't giving up. "You don't need to pretend with me. I know you're just trying to get his attention."


Stella rolled her eyes so hard they nearly fell out. "Your relationship problems are not my responsibility. I've kept everything with him strictly professional. If you don't like seeing us talk, maybe you should request a transfer."



She had done her best to steer clear of the drama, but Nathalia seemed hell-bent on dragging her in.


They were all part of the same research institute, and she couldn't just run away every time she saw William,could she?


"If it's not you chasing him..." Nathalia sneered, "are you suggesting he's chasing
you?"


Compared to what Stella had said, Nathalia found it even harder to believe that William would be the one pursuing her.


Stella didn't bother explaining any further.What was the point? Love had a way of making people irrational.


"Believe what you want, Miss Fuller," she said with a small smile. "Enjoy your meal.I'm done here."


Back in her dorm room, Stella flopped onto her bed with a heavy sigh. She rubbed her temple, then reached for her phone, hoping a mindless scroll through social media would help her decompress. But the moment she unlocked the screen, a new notification lit up the top. A message from William, sent ten minutes ago.


She sat up abruptly, blinking in disbelief.
###Chapter 74 Send Him Midnight Snack
                 




The bold message read, "I'm in my room.Bring me something to eat."


She blinked in disbelief, thinking she might've misread it. But no-she double-checked the contact. It really was from William.



Was he seriously expecting her to play room service? Did something happen to his legs or hands? Couldn't he grab his own food?


They were just colleagues. It wasn't like she owed him anything. She wasn't his assistant,let alone his maid.


And besides, didn't she see a plate of food in front of him during dinner? Didn't he eat his food?



The more she thought about it, the less sense it made.
She was tempted to ignore the message entirely, but after lying in bed for a while,she couldn't shake the unease gnawing at her.


William was her direct superior at the research institute. If she ticked him off, what if he held it against her?


He did seem like someone who held grudges. They'd already had a few awkward run-ins, and he clearly hadn't forgotten,especially that embarrassing shower incident...


Just thinking about it made Stella shiver.With a sigh, she reluctantly climbed out of bed.


Whatever. She wasn't going to stoop to his level. Delivering food wasn't a big deal.Twenty minutes tops, and she'd be back under the covers.


When Laura came out from the bathroom with damp hair, Laura noticed her slipping on a coat and getting ready to leave. Her brows furrowed slightly. "Stella? It's late-where are
you going?"


"I'm just a little hungry," Stella said casually."Heading to the cafeteria to see if there's anything left."



Without waiting for a response, she opened the door and stepped out.


Laura watched the door close behind her,feeling a bit puzzled. Stella never ate this late.


Maybe she really was hungrier than usual today.


Shrugging it off, Laura went back to her reading.



Meanwhile, Stella walked straight to the cafeteria. Luckily, they kept a few late-night snacks on hand. The options weren't impressive, but it was enough to satisfy a grown man's appetite.


With a tray of noodles and some sides in hand,she made her way toward Room 305.



Once she reached the door, she knocked
softly.


William was already inside when he heard the knock, and he quickly got up.


After messaging Stella, he'd been sitting on the sofa, still wearing the same robe she'd seen him in last time.


There was a mirror near the entrance, and as he walked over, he paused to check his reflection. He adjusted his collar slightly,making it look effortlessly relaxed, then casually opened the door.


The door swung open, and William's tall frame came into view.



Stella's eyes darted up, caught a glimpse,then instantly looked away.



Seriously?


Why was he opening the door like that-half-dressed and showing off his chest?


"Here's your food," she said quickly, holding the tray out to him. She wasn't planning to step inside and made sureto keep her eyes
fixed on the tray.


It might've been quiet now, but who could say if someone would step out of his room?


Therefore, she wasn't gonna take any chances, especially not with Nathalia having confronted her earlier that day. The last thing she needed was to be caught at William's door.


William let out a low chuckle, clearly amused by how she avoided looking at him. While accepting the food, he teased, "What's got you flustered? It's not like you haven't seen it before. You were pretty fearless last time,weren't you?"


Her cheeks heated up in embarrassment.This man really didn't let things go. He remembered everything!


Taking a quick step back, she said, "Okay,you've got your food. I'll get going now."



She turned to leave, but before she could take another step, William caught her wrist from behind.
"What's the hurry?" he said smoothly."Stay with me."



Her heart gave a sudden jolt. What exactly was he trying to do now?
###Chapter 75 | Don't Think This Is Appropriate




Stella froze, both confused and startled.William wanted to have a meal-shouldn't Nathalia be the one sitting across from him?



"Mr. Briggs, I don't think this is appropriate,"she said firmly, standing her ground like she was protecting her moral compass.



William didn't argue. Instead, he reached out and gave her forehead a light flick. "When I'm done eating, take the tray with you. I'm not delivering it myself."


With that, he turned and walked inside,leaving the door open behind him like a silent cue.



Stella blinked a few times before the pieces clicked.Oh.



He didn't mean he wanted to eat with her-he just didn't want to make a second trip.
She let out a breath she hadn't realized she was holding. Honestly, she'd been overthinking. For a second there, she thought he was being weirdly forward.


She followed him in and gently shut the door behind her, quietly taking a seat while he moved around the room.


But instead of starting his meal, William opened a drawer and pulled something out.He handed it over. "Is this yours?"


Stella looked down and instantly recognized her hair tie.



"Huh? Why do you have this?"



Yesterday, she'd had it wrapped around her wrist, but later that night, she found that it had disappeared.


She figured she'd lost it somewhere and didn't bother looking.


"Were you at the corner near the break room yesterday?" William asked casually, setting the tie on the table. "You're so careless.
Can't even keep track of a hair tie. How old are you?"


His tone was teasing, but it still annoyed her.



"Why can't I go there?" she muttered. "It's not like there was a sign. How was |supposed to know you were having a secret rendezvous with your first love? I didn't mean to walk in on it. If you're gonna do that kind of thing, maybe pick a more discreet spot."


She grabbed the hair tie and shoved it into her jacket pocket with a huff.


William, still holding his fork, paused before taking a bite. His brow furrowed at her words.


"What secret rendezvous?" he asked slowly."What did you see?"


Stella gave him a flat look. Was he seriously pretending he didn't know?


She felt awkward saying it out loud, but then again-she didn't do anything wrong, so why should she feel embarrassed?
"What else could I have seen? You and Nathalia kissing," she snapped, arms crossed, wearing a stiff, indignant expression.


William gave a slight nod, then said,completely deadpan, "I don't like kissing.Don't even know how to kiss. I've never kissed a woman."


Stella froze. Her eyes flew wide open. Wait,what?



Those three simple sentences hit her like a brick.



He didn't like kissing? Didn't know how? And had never kissed a woman?



Her brain screeched to a halt. Had she seen it wrong last night?



She replayed the angle in her head and realized-yeah, maybe she could've misunderstood the scene.



But hold on...what did he just say?


He didn't like kissing women? Did that
mean...he liked kissing men?


Stella gasped like she'd just uncovered the plot twist of the century, slapping a hand over her mouth in pure shock.


So that was it! No wonder he always looked like he'd bitten into something sour every time she got too close-he wasn't into women at all. He was gay.


All her accidental touches? Probably pure torture for him.


And poor Nathalia... Was she still holding out hope without knowing the truth? Or did she know and just refuse to let go?


As all these ridiculous thoughts tangled in her head, she actually started to feel a little bad for Nathalia.



Meanwhile, William was quietly eating, not one to explain himself often-but for some reason, when he found out that Stella had misunderstood the situation, he had felt the need to clarify.
He glanced up and caught her staring at him like he'd grown an extra head.




What was with that look? Why did she seem so...fascinated?




Did she think it was funny... or just plain sad that a guy his age had never kissed anyone?
###Chapter 76 William Likes Men





For a second, William actually regretted clearing things up earlier.



In hindsight, letting Stella keep misunderstanding him might've been the smarter move.


"Ms. Russell," he said, casually between bites, "since you're working at the research institute, maybe try to stay in the loop with the outside world. You can't contact anyone,sure,but you can still read the news."


That threw Stella off. Then it clicked-he was hinting at something. Marc.


The thought of him soured her mood instantly.


"There's no need for you to worry about that,Mr. Briggs!" she snapped, voice sharp with irritation.


William, meanwhile, ate with the composure
of someone sitting in a fine-dining restaurant. "I wouldn't bother either,but your husband seems... rather restless. At this rate,the whole world might hear about it."


He even chuckled after that, which pushed Stella's buttons even more.


First off, why was he still calling Marc her husband? And second, that laugh-was it aimed at Marc or her? Either way, she wasn't amused.


Seeing that he was nearly done eating, Stella stood abruptly and grabbed the tray.


"Well then, Mr. Briggs, since you've eaten, l suggest you get some sleep. Wouldn't want to risk insomnia!" she said with a pointed tone, then turned and stormed out without another word.


Back in the dorm, Laura was still awake.Seeing Stella walk in with a scowl, she raised a brow.


"You okay? Was the late-night snack that bad?"
Stella flopped down into her chair with a dramatic huff. "Ugh, yeah. Disgusting. Never going for that again."


Lying back in bed, Stella replayed William's cryptic comment and picked up her phone. It had been a while since she checked social media anyway. Sure enough, her feed was buzzing with updates about the Walsh family.



There were endless posts about Marc's search efforts-and the fallout of her patent withdrawal from Walsh Group.


Headlines. Speculations. Even some blurry,unflattering tabloid shots of Marc.



She stared at one of the photos and nearly laughed out loud. Marc, who was once obsessed with his image, now looked like a complete mess.



Hair disheveled. Hollow cheeks. Like he hadn't slept in days.



The abs he used to flaunt like trophies?Probably just a sad memory now.
Stella snorted.


Watching someone she hated fall apart was strangely comforting. That smug satisfaction made her fall asleep faster than she had in weeks.


Meanwhile, over at the Walsh Villa, the atmosphere was bleak. Marc sat alone in the dim study, a single floor lamp casting long shadows across the room.


His computer screen was filled with grim news-terminated contracts, a plummeting stock price, endless messages from his assistant asking how to fix it all.


The ashtray on the desk was overflowing. A fresh cigarette burned slowly between his fingers.


But the thing haunting Marc most wasn't the company's mess. It was the divorce agreement sitting on the desk.


He hadn't slept properly in days. Every time he closed his eyes, all he saw was Stella's cold,distant stare.
How had he missed all the signs?


How had he not realized she'd already made up her mind to leave him?


By the time the sky started to lighten, Marc finally splashed some water on his face,threw on a coat, and drove straight to the research institute.


He parked out front and, just like before,asked to speak to the management.


Last night, something Stella had said came back to him-she'd mentioned a closed project. He couldn't remember the exact details, but one thing was clear-it mattered to her.



That got him thinking. What if she was part of that project? What if that was why no one could reach her?


The security guard, already tired of his face,immediately called Paul.


Paul came out, looking more exhausted than annoyed this time. "What now, Marc? I've
already told you-Stella resigned."


Marc's visits every other day were becoming a nuisance.



Marc ignored him. "What about the closed project? Is she part of it?"


Paul sighed so deeply it looked like his soul left his body for a second. This guy was relentless. "If I show you the personnel list,will you leave and not make a scene?"


Marc nodded earnestly.



Paul led him to the office and handed him a printed document. "Here. Official stamp and all.Go ahead,check."



Marc grabbed it like it held the meaning of life and scanned every name twice. Then a third time. No Stella.


His shoulders slumped. The faint glimmer in his eyes died out.


Paul looked at him, tone softening. "If you still can't find her... maybe it's time to file a missing person report."
Marc's breath caught. Missing? The thought hit him like a punch to the gut.


No-he refused to believe something had happened to her.



He couldn't let anything happen to her.



Leaving the institute, he immediately contacted a private investigator and poured a fortune into the search.


He wasn't going to rest until he found her,whether she was in the country or halfway across the world.


Haley had been lying low ever since the police incident. Her family had barely kept her from ending up in jail, and now she was stuck at home under constant watch.


No more scandals. No more trouble.



But while she was stuck inside, she couldn't help scrolling through the same social media news-Marc was searching everywhere for Stella.


The jealousy burned like acid. Stella had left.
Why was he still so obsessed with Stella?



Haley couldn't stand it anymore. She booked a beauty treatment, put on a fresh new outfit,and headed straight for the Walsh Villa.
###Chapter 77 Is Stella Really That Important




Inside the Walsh Villa, Haley stared at Marc's hollow expression, torn between heartbreak and frustration.


"Get out," Marc muttered, waving her off like a bothersome fly.


But Haley wasn't giving up so easily. She rushed forward, grabbing onto his arm again."Marc, I know things are rough right now with Walsh Group, but I can help you! If you work with my family, we can get through this.I promise!"


At the mention of help, Marc finally blinked, a flicker of interest returning to his dull eyes.



Sensing she had his attention, Haley lit up with renewed confidence. "Marc, the company needs you! You have to pull yourself together. I'm here. I'll always be by your side,no matter what."
Marc looked at her, his voice low and raw."And how exactly do you plan on helping me?"


"It's easy," she said, beaming. "My family's got massive influence in Achury. You just need a few projects, right? I'll talk to my dad.He'll back you."


To Haley, this was nothing.



A simple favor. One she'd been saving for the right moment.


Now that Marc was at rock bottom, she believed her timing was perfect-he'd be desperate, dependent. And once he owed her, he'd be hers completely.


Marc didn't reply, but he didn't tell her to leave either.



That silence gave Haley hope. Encouraged,she went on, "But if my dad's going to help you,you'll have to marry me. Be his son-in-law. Don't worry about Stella-she's long gone. A woman like her, always chasing some thrill... who knows which random guy
she ran off with?"


That was it. Marc's fingers twitched.



Then, without warning, he snapped-grabbing Haley by the throat.



"Ahh!" she shrieked, eyes wide in terror.


She struggled against him, but his grip was relentless.



"Marc! What are you doing?! Let me go!" Her voice cracked with panic, but his eyes blazed with fury-cold, violent, unrecognizable.


She didn't get it. Everything she said was true, so why was he losing it?


Marc glared at Haley, suddenly realizing something he had missed.



Stella used to trust him. Blindedly.Completely. So when had that changed?When had she stopped believing in him?


Unless... someone told her. There was no other way she could have found out.


His gaze darkened as he stared at Haley. Of
course. She had told her. "Give me your phone," he growled, his grip tightening.


Haley didn't know why he wanted her phone,but she didn't dare resist, fearing he might snap her neck if she said no.



"I-it's in my bag... Marc, please... just let me go,l-I can't breathe..."



Still holding her with one hand, he dug through her bag with the other. The second he unlocked her phone and opened the messages, his jaw clenched.



She hadn't even bothered to delete the evidence. She was truly stupid.



The chat logs with Stella were all there.



Messages laced with provocation,manipulation, and photos. Enough to turn a mild suspicion into cold certainty.



He threw the phone down, his grip tightening even further.



Haley was losing air, her face turning purple.
"Didn't I warn you? I told you never to tell Stella about us. How did you promise me back then, huh?" His voice dropped to a whisper, lethal and full of menace. "If you think your life's running too long, I can end it for you right now."


Haley thrashed wildly, eyes bulging, face flushed and contorted. Her nails scraped at his arms.


She was slipping fast.


Just when she was on the verge of passing out, Marc shoved her away like garbage. She hit the floor hard, coughing violently, gasping for breath with tears streaming down her face.


She looked pitiful-makeup smeared, hair tangled, pride in shreds.


"Marc... why? Why do you treat me like this?"she sobbed. "Is Stella really that important to you?"


Marc stared down at her, eyes blazing. "Yes.Haley let me make this verv clear_" His
voice was ice. "You could multiply yourself a thousand times and you still wouldn't be worth a single strand of Stella's hair. The mistress of the Walsh family can only be Stella. Never you. You were nothing but a distraction. Did you really think I loved you?"


Haley broke down completely, sobbing into her hands as Marc walked away without a second glance.


He didn't accept the Smith family's help.He didn't need them. He had his own ways of dealing with the company. Right now, none of that mattered-not stock prices, not contracts, not damage control. The only thing that mattered was finding Stella.


Later, in his study, Marc sat in front of the camera.He hit record. And began to speak.
###Chapter 78 Presumed Death





Marc's talk lasted for ten full minutes,detailing every interaction between him and Stella-laying bare how deeply he cared for her-and ended with a heartfelt apology.



"Stel, I love you. I know I did wrong. I'm not here to beg for forgiveness. I just want to make sure you're safe. If you choose to stay away from me forever, I'll understand. I just can't stop worrying about you."


Once posted, the video spread like wildfire,racking up views and shares until it took over social media again.



But at the high-security research facility,Stella remained completely in the dark.



She had long since stopped keeping up with anything related to Marc.


"Stella, the process for our new identities is almost done. We'll finally be allowed to reach out beyond these walls. Isn't that amazing?
I've felt so boxed in here!" Laura chatted as she lounged in their dorm.


Stella perked up at that and began to ask more questions. What would become of their former identities?


Laura replied, "That's all handled. Once we sign the consent forms, the institute sends our families a formal notice, presumed dead."



Presumed dead?


So it wasn't a rumor after all.



Stella found the idea reassuring. She was eager for the notice to go out.



Naturally, she signed.



Back outside, Marc had tracked down Lainey at the research facility. "Tell me where Stel went. You're her closest friend, you'd know."



Lainey shot him a flat look and responded with thinly veiled contempt. "Don't act clueless now. Haven't you done enough? You broke her heart, and now you're here asking
me? I don't know where she is."


Marc stepped in front of her. "I knowl messed up. But I'd never hurt her again, l swear it. Just tell me where she went."


Lainey wasn't buying it. If anything, she felt relieved Stella had stayed silent and hadn't contacted her.


With a touch of irony, she pulled up her chat log and held it out. "See for yourself. She hasn't answered me either. Nobody knows where she is. So do us both a favor and leave me alone. Try anything else, and I'll report you."


She walked away without offering a single clue.



Marc stood there, replaying the empty thread in Lainey's messages.


Stella hadn't even replied to Lainey. Could she really be...


No. He wouldn't believe that.


He kept searching, no matter how much it
cost, pouring money into investigators and contacts.


Then, one afternoon, the doorbell rang. Marc opened it to find two police officers waiting on the porch.


"Are you Mr.Marc Walsh?"


His expression shifted to cautious confusion."Yeah,I am. What's going on?"


Though he'd used every connection he could think of, he'd never gone to the authorities.He couldn't bring himself to believe Stella had vanished-she just didn't want him in her life.



The officers didn't soften their tone. "We're here to deliver a formal notice of presumed death."



Marc blinked at them, his thoughts scrambling to catch up.



Noticing the disbelief on his face, one of the officers produced an ID. "Here's our identification."
Marc scanned the badge number, reluctant but forced to accept its legitimacy.


Even then, the words made no sense.



He took the document from the envelope and unfolded it. The moment he saw the name printed at the top, his vision sharpened, and a jolt ran through him.



"Seriously?" His voice rose with disbelief.



That couldn't be right.


The notice was for Stella?


Marc looked up at the officers, stunned."This has to be a mistake. Stella? No, she's just avoiding me. She's angry, not..."


She was probably just angry and avoiding him.There was no way she could actually be gone.


One of the officers answered steadily, "Sir,we don't handle these notifications lightly.The cause and date are both listed. Our job was to deliver it. We'll take our leave now."
Because the marriage hadn't been legally dissolved, the notice was sent to Marc as next of kin.


Once they left, Marc collapsed onto the couch,the document still in his hands. He read it again, and again.


It said Stella had taken personal leave, and then been in a vehicular incident.


Still unwilling to believe it, Marc began digging for information about that day. There had been a vehicular incident, exactly as the letter described.


And her name really was on the passenger manifest.


He feIt like the air had been knocked out of him. His grip on the document grew unsteady as his fingers shook.


How was that possible? How could Stella be gone all of a sudden?


He'd finally made up his mind to walk away from Haley.
Stella wanted a child, and he was ready for that, he wanted it too.


He had imagined rebuilding their life together.


Whatever had existed between him and Haley had always been about the investment. His heart never left Stella.


So why had it come to this?



The official paper lying in his hands offered no answer, only a brutal, undeniable fact.


Marc sat frozen, eyes fixed on the paper in his hand. The entire morning passed in a blur, with the household staff moving quietly,afraid to disturb him.


Then, without warning, Marc flung the document to the floor.



No,no way!


This wasn't real. It had to be a lie.



Stella worked at a high-level research facility one that dealt with classified information. If
they wanted to fabricate an official document, it wouldn't be difficult.


This so-called notification must have been forged.


A scheme by the institute to help Stella disappear, to push him toward giving up and signing the divorce.


The realization sparked a fit of laughter. It was manic and sharp.


She'd really gone this far, just to be rid of him?



His attention drifted to the untouched divorce papers lying nearby. His expression hardened.



Even if she truly was dead, he wouldn't sign them.


He'd track her down and expose the farce.


Leaving the paper where it had fallen, Marc threw on his coat and stormed out the door.
By five in the evening, after the institute's daily operations wrapped up, Lainey made her way out with her bag slung over her shoulder. She was ready to call it a day and rest.


Stella still hadn't texted or called her. While a trace of worry lingered, she didn't think Stella was in danger, at least not physically.


But as she reached the main gate and stepped onto the road, a shadow loomed ahead.


Startled, Lainey halted and took a cautious step back. Marc stood there.


Her surprise quickly gave way to irritation.



"Marc, what kind of mess are you trying to stir up this time?"
###Chapter 79 The Best Match





Marc's voice was hoarse, frantic. "Where the hell is Stella?"



Lainey looked like she'd just about had it with him.



Her tone was sharp, eyes blazing. "I told you already-| don't know. You saw our last messages. She didn't even reply. What do you want from me? You're the one who wrecked everything. And now you suddenly care?"



She scoffed, folding her arms. "You should've thought about this before you tore her apart. Don't show up now acting like some tragic lover. It's pathetic."


She was genuinely fed up with Marc's theatrics. Marc's belated affection was as worthless as stale news.


Marc wasn't listening. His eyes were bloodshot, fingers clenched into fists.
"Two people came to my house this morning claiming to be police. They handed me a death certificate. Said it was Stella's." His voice cracked. "I don't believe it. I can't believe it. This is your research institute's doing, isn't it? Some trick-just to keep me away from her." He jabbed a finger at her,trembling with fury. "Don't even try to deny it. I'm not going anywhere until you tell me where she is."



He had been taking things easy with Lainey,and this was why they were messing with him.



Lainey froze. "A death certificate?" she repeated,eyes narrowing in shock.


Marc watched her like a hawk. She looked...genuinely surprised. Not the reaction of someone in on some twisted scheme. His heart sank.



Could she really not know? She was one of Stella's closest friends, yet she didn't know about this?
Could it be true?


"Stop pretending. Don't you really know?"Marc tried to keep his calm, his voice trembling as he pressed on.


Lainey's eyes widened, filled with a mix of panic and disbelief. "How would I know?Stella's dead? She's really dead?"


Lainey's eyes were wide with panic, but deep inside,her mind was racing.



The institute did issue death certificates for members of classified projects-it was protocol.


That meant... Stella had joined.


So that was what she'd been hiding. A strange mix of relief and pride washed over her-Stella had finally gotten what she wanted, and as a bonus, ditched Marc in the process.Perfect.


But now, she had to keep up the act.



She blinked hard and forced a few tears to well up. She grabbed her purse and hurled it
at him.


"How dare you come here accusing me?!"she screamed. "Why is she dead, Marc?Huh? That's on you! You killed her!"


Mar. wasn't buying it. He dodged Lainey's outburst, face like stone, voice low but unrelenting.


"Was it William? Did he take her away?" He kept asking, again and again.


It was the only thing that made sense.



Why else had Stella vanished without a trace? William-cold, calculated, powerful.Of course he'd be the one to help her disappear.


Lainey flinched slightly. His guess was scarily accurate. But she held her ground, masking her surprise with a cracked, tearful expression.


"Are you insane? You're accusing her of running off with someone right after hearing she's dead?! Do you even hear yourself?
You've got no shame!" She shoved his shoulder hard. "Get out! Just get out-l never want to see your face again!"


Covering her face, she stormed back to her dorm, sobbing loud enough for the entire hallway to hear.


Marc stood there for a beat, torn between chasing after her and screaming into the sky.But just then, his phone rang. It was Kody.


"Mr. Walsh, you need to get back to the office. Fast. A bunch of investors just pulled out-we're barely hanging on."


Kody's tone was urgent. Marc's expression turned grim, jaw locked as he stared down at the screen.


Right now... the company couldn't afford to collapse.


No matter what it took, he was going to get to the bottom of Stella's disappearance.


Without another word, he ended the call,then turned and headed straight back to the
company.







Meanwhile, in a completely different world,Stella was living a full, focused life inside the confidential project group. Every day was packed. Some tasks were challenging,but the team was sharp-they solved problems fast and moved forward even faster.


Marc? He hadn't crossed her mind much lately. But if she had to guess, she figured his life was only spiraling deeper into chaos.


Now, with the prep work nearly complete, the team was gearing up to enter the formal research phase.


That meant round-the-clock commitment.No distractions. No outside noise.


Sitting in her chair that afternoon, Stella leaned back and let out a long breath. She didn't want to just bury her past-she wanted to rebuild herself fromn scratch.When this was all over, she hoped she'd emerge as someone entirely new. Someone better.
Six months passed in the blink of an eye.


Stella now sat on a plane bound for Choria,lost in thoughts as the skyline slowly came into view through the window.


William sat beside her. He noticed the quiet tension in her face and asked softly, "Have you decided what you'll do now that you're back?"



The project had been a huge success.


As part of their confidentiality agreement,every member had the option to either take up their old identity-or disappear into a new one forever.


Hearing his question, Stella gave a faint smile."Stella died six months ago," she said calmly. "There's no reason to go back to a name that doesn't mean anything anymore."


William glanced over at her, a flicker of something like admiration passing through his eyes.


"If you're interested," he said, "I could offer
you a position at Briggs Group. Technical Director."



Stella blinked, genuinely caught off guard.Six months ago, this man had been ice cold and completely dismissive of her skills.


Now he was offering her a high-ranking role?



She turned to him, her smile laced with playful sarcasm. "Mr. Briggs, are you finally admitting I'm good at what| do?"


By now, thei dynamic had shifted.



What had once been formal was now relaxed -friendly,even.


Her eyes sparkled with playful mischief.



William chuckled under his breath, eyes glinting. "Let's just say... you passed."


Passed? That was it?




Stella opened her mouth to ask more, but before she could say anything, a cold voice cut in from a few seats over.
"If I were you, Ms. Russell," Nathalia said sharply, "I'd have a little more self-awareness. The Briggs Group doesn't hire people through backdoor connections. They hire based on merit."


Nathalia had spent the last six months circling William like a hawk-doing everything in her power to earn his attention. But William had been polite at best, indifferent at worst.



Despite her qualifications, he hadn't once offered her a position in his company. And now here he was-extending a job offer to Stella of all people.



What was it about Stella?


Stella turned toward her with a raised brow,unbothered.


At first, Stella had assumed Nathalia was just another unfortunate soul. But as time went on, it became clear-this had always been one-sided.


William was naturally distant. He kept people
at arm's length, always cool, aiways composed.


And Nathalia? She was just another name on the list.



Stella actually felt a little sorry for her.Because William liked men. And Nathalia, no matter how hard she tried, was chasing a ghost.


Stella didn't feel angry-just amused. She turned, smiled sweetly at Nathalia, and said with that disarming calm, "You're absolutely right, Ms. Fuller. I'm not good enough.You're the best match. The perfect match,really."Then she tilted her head, almost thoughtfully. "Oh! I just remembered-I need to check something with Maia. I'll let you two...bond."



And with that, she stood and walked away,settling into the seat beside Maia, giving the two space.



William's gaze followed her the whole way.His expression darkened by the second
###Chapter 80 It's Not Along My Way
   




Stella's careful demeanor seemed to sit well with Nathalia, who smiled gracefully and took the seat next to William.



"William, where are you headed after we land in Choria? If we're going the same way maybe we can go together."


But William cut her off without giving her the opening she wanted. "Wherever that is, it's not along my way."


Nathalia was left speechless. All the lines she'd rehearsed had suddenly become meaningless.


After saying that, William got up and walked over to Stella's side, his gaze landing on Maia,who was sitting next to her.


"I need to talk to Stella about work," he said plainly.


Maia had been mid-conversation with Stella
when she noticed a tall shadow fall over her.


Looking up, she was met with William's serious expression. Remembering how strict William could be at the research institute,she instinctively nodded, almost like a reflex.


"Uh...sure."



She gathered her belongings in a hurry and moved to the seat William had vacated,offering a polite nod to Nathalia as she passed.


"Nice to see you,Nathalia."


Nathalia clenched her jaw, barely containing her irritation.



Stella, on the other hand, was left momentarily speechless.


She'd just handed him a golden chance to get closer to Nathalia-why was he sitting next to her instead?


She looked up at him with a faint, teasing smile. "Didn't we wrap that up already?What's left to talk about now?"
William casually tossed a folder onto the table, his gaze firm. "There's an upcoming collaboration in Briggs Group. You'll be handling it."


Stella blinked in surprise. When had she signed up for this? Since when was she dealing with Briggs Group's business?


Before she could speak, William shot her a cold look."What? Think you're not up for it?"



She knew he was baiting her.



But truthfully, the opportunity with Briggs Group was the most strategic move for her right now.


There was no reason to turn it down.



After a brief pause, Stella raised an eyebrow and smiled. "Is this a test, Mr. Briggs? Don't worry.I'll get it done."


There was a glint in her eyes-confident and unwavering.


WVilliam's lips curved faintly. "Good. Let's see how it turns out."
An hour later, the plane touched down in Briset-the city where Briggs Group was headquartered. Since she'd already accepted the role of director in William's company, there was no reason to return to Choria.



What she didn't expect, however, was for William to hand her a set of keys right then and there.


She stared at him, puzzled. "What's this?"


She hadn't even officially started yet, and he was already giving her... something?


A quiet warning echoed in her mind, "Beware of unexpected gifts." She eyed the keys cautiously, making no move to take them.


William turned to look at her, one eyebrow lifting as he leaned in slightly. Their eyes locked, and the closeness between them brought a hint of tension to the air.


"It's part of your employee benefits," he said,his tone calm. "You're working in Briset now,so this place is yours. The Briggs Group
makes sure its people are well taken care of."


Stella blinked, raising a brow. "Do all your employees get handed villas, Mr. Briggs?"


William stood up straight again and shot her a look. "It's not a gift-it's temporary housing. You're free to find your own place if you prefer."


With that, he turned and headed toward the exit, leaving Stella pressing her lips together in thought.


She had no doubt the villa would be luxurious. Honestly, it would be a waste not to use it.



Now that the recent project had wrapped up,Stella officially joined the project team, but her presence was only required as needed.


The remaining time was hers to manage, free from the research institute's oversight.


So using her spare hours to pick up part-time work at Briggs Group felt like a smart move. After all, who in their right mind turned
down extra income?


Stella wheeled her suitcase into the villa.Though unoccupied, it was spotless-clearly kept tidy through routine maintenance.


She spent the next two days unpacking,stocking up on essentials, and giving the place a light cleanup. On her third evening in Briset, she had an event to attend.


William had already emailed her the documents, and she had studied them with care.



Her role was to represent a newly launched firm and negotiate a partnership with SummitRise Group-one of Briset's oldest and most established names.


As she sat in the car, Stella couldn't shake the feeling that this was William's way of testing her.


The success of this collaboration would come down to her own skills.



At the entrance of the banquet hall, she took
a moment to adjust her coat, then stepped inside-her silver, diamond-studded heels catching the light with every step.


The doorman held the door open, revealing an opulent, glimmering banquet hall beyond.



The sound of her entrance drew attention;people paused mid-conversation and turned toward her.


Since Briset was far from Choria, few had seen Stella before. But watching her stride in with poise in a designer gown, admiration sparked in their eyes.


"Who's that? I've never seen her before.Maybe some heiress fresh back from abroad?" someone murmured.


"No idea, but that dress? I saw it in a magazine-it's a limited edition," another whispered.
###Chapter 81 Interesting





Facing a banquet hall full of unfamiliar faces,Stella stood poised and unflinching. Her gaze swept across the crowd at an even pace, her lips curved in a polite smile as she nodded to those who met her eyes. Every inch of her radiated quiet confidence.



She stood tall and unhurried, allowing others to take her in.



For years, she'd played the part of Marc Walsh's wife-a life of dinner parties and social niceties replaced with domestic routines. She'd wondered if those years had dulled her ability to navigate a room like this.


But the moment she walked in, she realized she hadn't lost her touch.


There was no anxiety, no hesitation. Just a calm, grounded certainty that she belonged.


That she would shine.
Before coming, she had done her homework on the SummitRise Group and the man at the center of it all-Steven Harrison.


Young, accomplished, and rarely seen on home soil after years abroad. It didn't take long to spot him. Even in this sea of designer suits and polite ambition, he stood out.


Glass of champagne in hand, Stella made her way to him, heels clicking softly across the marble.



"Mr. Harrison," she greeted with a soft but steady voice. "I'm Stella, representing Nebula."



Steven had already noticed her when she entered, but now that she introduced herself,his brow arched. "'Nebula'? And which Nebula would that be?"



The company was new-still carving out its place-so the question didn't surprise her.


Without missing a beat, she offered him a composed smile and calmly pitched the company. "Nebula is a promising young
company, Mr. Harrison. And if you give us a chance to collaborate, I'm confident we'll exceed your expectations."


He swirled the wine in his glass, amused."Everyone here represents a company. What makes you think you'll do better than the rest?"


"I understand the competition," Stella said calmly. "But I've studied your project specs,your company's vision, and your needs for this particular collaboration. They align seamlessly with what we offer. If you give us the chance, I'm confident our first proposal will meet your expectations."


Steven gave her a slow, intrigued look."That's quite a claim."


Meeting his expectations with the first proposal wasn't going to be easy.


She gave a small smile. "I have great confidence in our company's professional capabilities."


Still, Steven felt the need to ground her.
"You're young, Ms. Russell. It's good to be bold. But overconfidence tends to lead to a harder fall."


Stella didn't flinch. "Confidence backed by ability isn't arrogance. Let me put it this way:if our proposal doesn't pass, Nebula will compensate SummitRise financially. No strings, no second chances. And we'll also provide global-grade technical support."


The air between them shifted. Steven's glass stopped mid-swish.


He stared at her for a moment, surprised. No one in the room had made that kind of offer -especially not from a startup.


The financial compensation would be huge,and she was offering it if the proposal failed,without even needing a second chance.


He met her gaze again, this time more seriously.


She wasn't bluffing. Her eyes held no trace of doubt. Just clarity.
After a long pause, Steven nodded. "Since you're that confident, I'll give you the opportunity, Ms. Russell."


Stella's smile deepened. "Thank you. I promise-you won't be disappointed."


Steven studied her quietly for a moment longer, a spark of genuine admiration in his eyes.


No wonder William had sent her. She wasn't just beautiful-she was sharp, articulate, and bold.



Her negotiation style was nothing short of elegant.


She was... interesting.


He could see why she had William's attention.


As they continued talking, a voice interrupted them from the side.


"Mr.Harrison."



Stella's eyes flickered. She turned her head
slowly, unsurprised.


Marc And Haley. She knew this moment would come eventually.



Now that she was back, crossing paths with Marc was inevitable.


But seeing him now... it felt distant. Hollow.They were nothing more than strangers.


Marc and Haley stood together in matching attire-Haley clinging to Marc's arm like a prized accessory. "Mr. Harrison, long time no see," she said sweetly.


Marc offered a practiced smile.



Six months ago, Haley had used her connections in Achury to help bail out the Walsh Group.



Now, with SummitRise launching a new energy project, Walsh Group was eager to get a foot in the door. Haley's familiarity with Steven had been their entry point-and she was making full use of it.


Steven gave a slight nod of
acknowledgment. "Ms. Smith. And this is...?"


Haley smiled. "This is Marc Walsh, CEO of Walsh Group in Choria.He heard about your bid and camne to take a look."


Marc was just about to introduce himself-lay out his pitch-when his eyes fell on the woman beside Steven.


A silver gown. Slender frame. That face.Marc froze.


His heart clenched.


It was her.



In that moment, Marc's mind short-circuited -business, Haley, everything just disappeared. He rushed forward, grabbing Stella's hand like a drowning man clinging to driftwood.


"Stel... it's really you." His voice cracked with disbelief. "I knew it. I knew you weren't dead.You've forgiven me, right? That's why you're here...right?"
###Chapter 82 How Could She Not Be Stella




Even Haley stood frozen, her smile faltering as she stared at the woman beside Steven Harrison. That face. That posture. That aura.It can't be... Stella? But that was impossible.She was supposed to be dead. There had even been an official death certificate.


Yet here she was-alive, glowing, and even more striking than before.


Haley's hands tightened involuntarily around her clutch. No... it's not her. It can't be.


Just then, Stella's arm was gripped hard-Marc, his voice trembling, looked as if he'd just seen a ghost.


But Stella quickly yanked her arm away, her expression turning icy. "Sir, I don't know you.You've mistaken me for someone else. I'm here to discuss business with Mr. Harrison."Her tone was sharp, clipped and distant.
Marc panicked. "Stella, enough. Don't do this. Do you have any idea how long l've been searching for you? I turned the whole damn country upside down! I know | was wrong-I swear I'll make it right this time.Come home with me."


He thought-maybe hoped-that he could still pull her back. He didn't sign the divorce papers-she was still his wife. "You are Stella. I'm sure of it. You're my wife."


Stella almost laughed. After all this time-six whole months-Marc hadn't changed a bit.Still trying to charm his way through everything with that same self-righteous attitude.


She let out a soft, mocking chuckle.


"Your wife? Wow. That's cute. Sir, if this is your idea of flirting, you're seriously off the mark. And for the record, I prefer gentlemen."


Then she turned toward Steven with an apologetic look. "Sorry about this, Mr.
Harrison. I'll stop by your office another time to continue our conversation."


After all, she was under William's protection.Steven wouldn't dare let anything happen to her-not in his presence.


Steven gave a slight nod, clearly about to respond when Marc suddenly reached out again and grabbed her arm.


"It's not possible," he said, voice hoarse with desperation. "You are Stella."



His voice broke as the scene around them slowed-guests now fully focused on the growing commotion.



Stella's patience snapped. Smack! The sound of the slap cracked through the air,silencing the room. Her eyes were like frost as she looked down at him. "You're being extremely rude, sir."


She reached into her clutch, pulled out her ID,and held it up for him to see. "My name is Sylvia Gilbert. I don't know any Stella. And as for your wife..." She tilted her head, her smile
cool. "Maybe get help for those delusions."


Marc's cheek stung, but he couldn't care less at the moment.



He gaze was locked on the ID in disbelief.



It wasn't just the name-it was the birth date,the address, the background. Everything was wrong.



And yet... her face was unmistakable.


How could this not be Stella?



As he stood there, stunned, she casually slid the card back into her bag and added lightly,"If this was some desperate tactic to get my attention, sir, I'd advise you to try a little harder-and a lot less creepily."


Marc, dazed, shook his head. "No... no, if you're not Stella, then why are you even here? You knew I'd be at this banquet, didn't you? You came for me."


Stella laughed, amused by his shallow reasoning. "Sir, what gives you such extraordinary confidence for someone so...
ordinary? I'm here to discuss business with Mr. Harrison. What does that have to do with you?"


Marc's face darkened. Business? With Steven? He stood there, momentarily stunned.


He pursed his lips slightly, his expression a mix of confusion and something else. "Stella,whatever this is, you're pushing it now. Let's deal our personal matters privately."


Regardless, he had to secure the SummitRise Group's project. Once he did, he wouldn't be under Haley's thumb anymore.


He turned to Steven. "Mr. Harrison, I apologize for the earlier scene. Walsh Group is fully capable of managing the new energy project, and I hope you'll give us fair consideration."


Steven had been silently observing the entire exchange, expression unreadable.


Now he smiled faintly. "Of course, Mr. Walsh.Fair competition is the only way to do
business. But you should know-Nebula Group has offered quite a compelling proposal. They've guaranteed the plan will pass on the first round, no revisions needed.And if it doesn't, they're prepared to offer immediate financial compensation. Can Walsh Group offer the same?"


Marc's jaw slackened. No revisions?Immediate compensation?


He turned to look at Stella. WVas she out of her mind?



How was she so confident their plan would pass on the first try?



The risk alone was astronomical-eight-figure losses at minimum if the proposal failed.And she agreed to that?


Moreover, Steven had just said Stella could provide the latest technology.


Her previous patent had already made waves -it was cutting-edge at the time. So what could she possibly have come up with now that was even better?
He felt a dull ache creeping into his temples.What the hell had she been up to during the six months she vanished?
###Chapter 83 A True Gentleman Doesn't Harass A Woman






Haley stood stiffly beside Marc, trying to make sense of what Steven had said.



That outrageous compensation clause?Maybe-maybe-she could pull some strings with her father to cover it. But the rest? The cutting-edge tech Stella claimed to have?She had nothing.


Haley's expression soured. She squeezed Marc's arm like a vice and shot Stella a venomous glare.



"What new technology could you possibly have? Besides WAY2, what else is there? The Walsh Group already mastered WAY2. Don't talk big just to show off-you'll only dig your own grave."


Stella looked at her like she was watching a toddler throw a tantrum in public."WAY2?"she said, one brow raised. "Miss Smith,are
you sure that's the name? Because I think what you meant was WAY MORE-the upgraded version of the original WAY tech."


A hush fell over the small group. Haley's face flushed beet red. She'd gotten the name wrong in front of everyone-a painfully obvious sign she had no idea what she was talking about.


She was obviously big talk, a joke to everyone.


She clenched her fists but said nothing.What could she say?


Stella turned back to Steven, her voice calm and steady. "Mr. Harrison, WAY MORE dropped three years ago. It was groundbreaking at the time, sure-but three years is a lifetime in tech. If the Walsh Group is still peddling that, then that's honestly kind of sad."



Marc stared at her under the dazzle of the chandelier, momentarily lost. The light danced on her skin, but it wasn't just the
glow that struck him-it was her.


In the six months since she vanished, she'd transformed into someone else entirely.



She stood taller, spoke sharper, moved like a woman who no longer second-guessed herself. Stronger. Smarter. Untouchably radiant.


What had she been up to for the past six months? Had she really emerged with brand-new technology in hand?


Steven's gaze lingered, his interest sharpening into something more serious. His admiration for Stella wasn't just growing-it was cementing.


His smile deepened, and he turned back to Marc. "So,Mr.Walsh? Anything to add?"


Marc's lips parted, but no words came out.He had nothing. Stella had walked out with her patent, and the Walsh Group hadn't produced anything worth bragging about since.
Steven gave a light clap, as if the performance was over. "In that case, the project will go to Nebula. I trust you have no objections, Mr.Walsh?"


Marc stood frozen. He had just been publicly outmaneuvered. Again. He couldn't even deny it. He simply kept silent.


Stella didn't bother lingering either. She turned to leave without another glance.


But Marc, clearly out of his depth, scrambled after her like a drowning man reaching for a lifeline. "Stel-wait! Are you really working with Nebula? That company's brand new. It has no backing, no stability. You can't be serious."


She ignored him completely, walking as if he didn't exist.


Marc wasn't ready to give up. "Stel, don't do this. I know I messed up, okay? But you've been gone for six months. You've had time to cool off. Come home. You don't need to work for some unstable startup. Come back to the
Walsh Group. It's your company too. You're my wife."


At that, Stella stopped.



She turned around slowly, her tone razor-sharp. "First of all-I am not your wife.Second-Nebula, even as a brand new company,just beat your Walsh Group in a fair bid. And third-you're clinging to outdated tech like it's some kind of achievement. Let me remind you-you lost."


Marc's face turned a deep shade of crimson,but he swallowed his pride and tried again."Okay. Fine. Scold me all you want, I don't care. Just come back to me,okay? You want to stay at Nebula? Fine. I'll support it. I'll support anything. Just... don't shut me out like this."


Stella stared at him like he was speaking another language.


Before she could reply, Steven reappeared at her side and casually laid a hand on Marc's shoulder. "Mr. Walsh, I'm going to stop you
right there. We all know your wife disappeared six months ago. But that doesn't give you the right to claim a random woman as your spouse. That's called harassment."


Stella gave Steven a sideways glance,gratitude flickering in her eyes.


Marc clenched his jaw. "You're wrong. She's not a random woman. She's Stella Russell.I know my own wife-l'd never mistake her."


Steven let out a short laugh. "You must have incredible eyesight, then, because I'm pretty sure the name on that ID wasn't Stella Russell. It was Sylvia Gilbert. You still think they're the same person?"


That did it. The crowd, already whispering,broke out in a fresh wave of hushed giggles and scandalized murmurs.


"I heard about this. His wife left him after he cheated,right?"


"Men like him always come crawling back when it's too late."
"Didn't he show up with that other woman earlier? And now he's playing the heartbroken husband? Seriously?"


The remarks stabbed Marc from every angle,but Steven wasn't done.


"Mr. Walsh," Steven said coolly, voice carrying through the murmuring crowd, "a true gentleman doesn't harass a woman.Show a little class, will you?"


Marc froze. That one sentence pinned him to the wall harder than any slap.


If he kept pushing now, he wouldn't just lose face-he'd confirm every whisper in the room that he was nothing more than a possessive fool, clinging to a woman who no longer belonged to him. And in Choria's elite circles, reputations didn't bend-they shattered.


This would put Walsh Group in a bad light.


He glanced at Steven, jaw clenched so tight it could've cracked teeth. But the man standing before him wasn't just anyone-he
was Steven Harrison.


So Marc swallowed his pride, forced a stiff nod, then turned to Stella.


His eyes lingered-desperate, pleading, full of regret. But she didn't flinch. Without another word, he turned and walked out of the hall.


Haley, still reeling from the earlier humiliation, didn't dare stay a moment longer. She lifted her gown and scurried out after him. The spectacle was over. The ballroom slowly returned to its usual rhythm.


Stella let out a small breath and looked at Steven. "Thanks for stepping in just now."


Steven gave a lazy flick of his hand,lips curled into the faintest of smiles. "Don't thank me," he said, eyes twinkling. "I'm not the one you should be thanking."
###Chapter 84 Scheming





Stella frowned, confused. He wasn't the one she should be thanking?


Then who was?



Steven caught the look on her face but didn't offer an explanation. Instead, he just smiled slightly and said, "I'm looking forward to seeing what you do next."


She had no idea what he meant, but didn't push it. She'd already said her thank-yous,and pressing for more would just feel awkward.


With the partnership officially in place, she figured it was time to head to Briggs Group and update William.







Meanwhile, Marc had stormed out of the banquet hall, walked a good few hundred meters, and finally stopped. Frustrated, he
yanked out a cigarette, lit it, and let out a long drag.


There was no way he had mistaken her. That was Stella. Even if she pretended not to know him in front of everyone, he was sure of it.


But why was she acting like this?


Yeah, maybe he'd screwed up in the past,but he'd apologized.



He'd promised it wouldn't happen again.Couldn't she at least give him one more chance?


They were married for years. Did she really feel nothing-no shame, no regret-for humiliating him like that in public?


He rubbed the bridge of his nose, a wave of helplessness washing over him.


Not far behind, Haley stood fuming.



For the past six months, she'd given everything to Marc-risked cutting ties with her family, begged her father to support
Walsh Group, and endured it all. And now?With Stella back in the picture, she was shoved aside like an afterthought.


Why?!



Why was she always the runner-up? Why couldn't she ever outshine Stella?



She was furious, but she knew better than to take it out on Marc now.


Complaining would only push him further away.


What she wanted-what she needed-was to keep him close.



So if that meant helping him get Stella back,then so be it.



Haley took a few steadying breaths, walked up behind him, and said softly, "Marc, don't get too worked up. I know it's tough seeing Stella pretend she doesn't know you. But l think... I might have a way to get her back."


Marc turned to her, eyes narrowing with suspicion.
"What kind of game are you playing now,Haley?"


He didn't believe Haley would genuinely help him win Stella back.



She blinked innocently, tears welling up as she looked at him. "I'm not playing games.just want you to be happy."


That softened him a little. His voice lost its edge. "What's this plan of yours to bring Stella back?"


Haley gave a faint smile. "Think about it. In just six months, she's changed so much. She even locked in that big project with Steven.That kind of turnaround? She's gotta have someone backing her."


Marc's face darkened. He was ready to argue-Stella wouldn't get involved with someone else. But then he remembered her getting into William's car.


Haley went on, "And those tech solutions she mentioned? I'm sure some of that came from Walsh Group. She worked there, right? She
must've had access to confidential info. She probably used it to win Steven over."


The more she spoke, the more convinced she became that Stella hadn't done this all on her own.


Marc didn't want to believe she'd stoop to stealing, but he also couldn't fully believe she had the ability to pull it off solo.


So... if it wasn't theft, then what was it?



"Even if someone's behind her and she did use Walsh Group's data... how the hell does that help me get her back?" he muttered,frowning.


He didn't care about lawsuits or revenge. He just wanted her beside him again.


Haley stepped in closer, rising up on her toes to whisper in his ear. "Accuse her of stealing company secrets. That way, she'll face prison time."


Marc's eyes snapped wide open, shocked by what she'd just said.
###Chapter 85 Are Her Clothes Really That Ugly





"Haley, what's wrong with you? How could you even suggest turning Stella in? She's the woman I married. I'd never do that to her!"Marc's voice rose with disbelief. The thought of Stella being arrested made him sick, and he knew Haley wasn't being honest.


Haley's eyes welled up with what looked like hurt."Marc, how can you think I meant it that way? That's not what I was trying to do. I just thought... if you filed a report anonymously and then stepped in to pull some strings,she'd have no choice but to rely on you. That might bring her back."


She sounded sincere.



Marc went quiet, weighing her words. Was that even possible?


"This might be the only option you have left,"Haley continued softly. "You're the head of
the Walsh Group. If you choose not to press charges, nothing will happen to her. She won't end up in prison. But think about it,she's made so much progress in just six months. The usual ways won't reach her anymore."


It was true. Halfway into the year she had grown even more impressive.


She had more choices now, and maybe that was why she no longer looked his way.



But what if she had nowhere else to turn? If he helped her... could she really keep walking away from him?



As Marc's expression began to shift, Haley recognized that he was thinking about it.


And while he stood there silently, her eyes gleamed with something sharp and bitter-something he never noticed.


Marc did have the power to decide whether or not Stella ended up behind bars. But if word got out that she had stolen Walsh Group's confidential material, her reputation
would collapse.


There wouldn't be a single company in all of Choria, or even in Briset, that would take her in.



The influential figure backing her now would walk away the moment she lost her usefulness.


And when that happened, Stella wouldn't stand a chance against her.







At Briggs Group, Stella followed Luca into William's office.



Luca gave a polite nod and quietly stepped out.



Now only the two remained.



Stella looked toward the man behind the desk, focused on the files before him.



His features were breathtakingly sharp, as if carved from marble. Even after seeing him so many times, she still found herself
catching different traces of beauty in his expression.


It was almost unreal.



She cleared her thoughts and began her update. "SummitRise Group has agreed to work with Nebula. I gave them my word that the proposal would pass in its original form,with no edits."


William lifted his head to look at her.



Stella braced herself, expecting a lecture,maybe something about making risky promises. She thought he might demand that she ensure its approval.


But instead, he gave a slow nod and spoke with an unexpected softness. "You've done weell."


Stella blinked in surprise. That was it? No criticism? "You're...not upset?"


William let out a low laugh. "Why would I be?"



"But... what if SummitRise ends up rejecting
the proposal?"


The payout would be huge.



"They won't," he replied calmly. "You were sure about that before you made the call,weren't you?"


His tone was light, almost like he was remarking on something ordinary.


Stella fell silent, caught off guard. She had believed she was the confident one, but clearly, it was William.


She turned slightly. "If that's all, I'll return to my desk."



There likely wouldn't be much more for her to do with SummitRise now.



William placed his pen aside, opened a drawer, and pulled something out. "Hold on.Take this with you."


She looked down and saw a sleek black credit card resting on the desk. It looked like one of those rare global exclusives. "You want me to pick something up for you?"
That was the only reason she could think of -why else hand her the card?


William's lips lifted in a faint smile. "It's for you. Think of it as an early payment. Buy yourself something you actually like, maybe clothes."


She happened to be wearing a dress he had chosen for her that day.


Her figure was graceful and well-proportioned, but she stuck mostly to plain T-shirts and jeans.


Though she had the frame to wear anything well, her outfits always downplayed it.


Stella gave him a confused look. "I have plenty of clothes."



William raised an eyebrow."You mean those washed-out outfits you wear to the lab?"


She fell silent.



Were they really that bad?
###Chapter 86 Odd, But Tolerable




"Now that you're officially part of Briggs Group, you'll be meeting clients often. Buy yourself a few new outfits, and make sure you represent the company properly."


Stella's lips twitched faintly. So that was it-he thought she might embarrass the company.


She forced a smile as she accepted the card,then muttered through clenched teeth,"Aren't you worried I'll drain this card dry, Mr.Briggs? You know how much girls enjoy shopping."


William glanced at her begrudging expression and chuckled. "Relax. Your salary's decent, and we'll just deduct it from that if needed."


Stella sighed in defeat and shoved the card into her bag, clearly annoyed.



Straightening her posture, she turned and
walked out of his office, holding her head high.


As he watched her walk away, William felt his spirits unexpectedly lighten. Even the stack of reports in front of him didn't seem quite as tedious anymore.


As Stella stepped out of the Briggs Group building, she tried to soothe herself. Alright-at least she had a villa and a black card. That was more than most companies offered.Sure, her boss was a little odd... but tolerable.







Back in the office, moments after Stella left,William's phone rang.


Steven's voice came through the line. "This one's interesting. I can see why you picked her."



William didn't bother asking questions. He just responded coolly, "Stay away from her."


That only piqued Steven's interest further.
"Oh? So you're actually serious this time."


William didn't react to the teasing.With eyes still on his screen, he said flatly, "If that's all,I'm hanging up."


"Wait-this is important," Steven cut in."You'll need to stop by in a couple of days to sign the contract."


Steven had no doubt about Nebula's proposal, especially now that Stella was involved.


There was no question in his mind-he was definitely signing with Nebula.


William gave a quiet hum of acknowledgment and, after ending the call,shot Stella a message wvith the contract signing date for SummitRise Group.







Stella was browsing racks of clothes when the message came through. With the black card in her hand, and knowing any overspending would just be docked from her
pay, she shopped without the slightest guilt.


After checking the contract date, she casually sent back an "OK" emoji and resumed her carefree shopping spree.



The day of the contract signing came quickly. Dressed in a sharp black business suit that gave her a sleek, polished look,Stella walked into the towering headquarters of SummitRise Group with quiet confidence.



Just as she stepped into the elevator and the doors began to slide shut, they suddenly reopened with a chime. Two people had pressed the button from outside.


Her brows lifted slightly when she saw who it was-Marc and Haley.


What were they doing here?



She didn't have time or energy to care.


Without saying a word, Stella shifted to the side, pretending she hadn't even seen them.


Marc looked at her with a mix of restraint and barely hidden excitement. But unlike before,
he didn't come near her.


Haley, on the other hand, had a different agenda. There was a satisfied curl to her lips as she stood beside Marc, her thoughts dripping with spite.


She had found out that Stella was scheduled to sign a contract with SummitRise today,and she'd shown up for one reason only-to ruin her.


She had even hidden a tiny camera in her purse, ready to capture Stella's downfall on video.


The plan was simple-humiliate Stella, post the footage online, and let the world laugh.


After this, Stella wouldn't just lose Marc-she wouldn't even have the dignity to walk around in public.


Stella caught the calculating glint in Haley's eyes and narrowed her own slightly.


Something was off.



They were clearly plotting something, but
she wasn't worried. Let them try.


The elevator ride was tense and silent. When it finally stopped on the conference room floor, Stella walked out, only to hear footsteps behind her.


Steven stood by the meeting room entrance.He hadn't scheduled anyone else today, so when he spotted Haley and Marc trailing behind Stella, his brows furrowed.


"Mr. Walsh, Ms. Smith," he said coolly, "I don't recall setting up a meeting with either of you."


Haley immediately stepped forward, taking charge. "Mr. Harrison, we're here to share something important. A truth, actually. We just didn't want you to be misled."


Steven tilted his head slightly, an amused gleam in his eyes. "Misled? And who exactly is trying to mislead me?"


Haley didn't hesitate. She pointed right at Stella, her voice rising with righteous indignation. "Her, Mr. Harrison! She told you
she had some so-called new technology to collaborate on, but the truth is-it's stolen.She took confidential files from Walsh Group!"


Steven raised his eyebrows and let out a soft chuckle. "Is that so? Mr. Walsh?" He turned toward Marc. "Can you confirm this? Did Ms.Gilbert really steal trade secrets from your company? I'm curious-how did she manage that?"



He had expected Marc to show some level of dignity, maybe even hesitate before tossing such an accusation.



But Steven had clearly overestimated him.


Marc looked at Stella with conflicted eyes that flickered with something unreadable.Then he said slowly, "Yes, Mr. Harrison.She's my wife. And I can confirm that around six months ago, out of anger, she took classified documents from the Walsh Group and disappeared. If you don't believe me,check her ID. It's likely fake. If you proceed with this collaboration, you might find
yourself tangled in legal trouble."


Haley jumped in with even more dramatic flair. "That's right. She's not Sylvia Gilbert-her real name is Stella Russell! Marc gave her a chance to work at Walsh Group out of kindness, and this is how she repaid him-by stealing sensitive data. And now she's using our company's core technology to strike a deal with SummitRise Group!"


Haley accused Stella with self-righteous anger.
###Chapter 87 Her Plan Had Fallen Apart




Stella stood calmly off to the side,her face unreadable.


She had to admit-Haley was slightly sharper than before, though not by much.


Stella gave a light laugh. "I'm not your wife,so how could I have stolen your company secrets? As for the fake ID claim, why don't you show me your evidence?"


She'd moved on from Marc long ago. As far as she was concerned, as long as they didn't cross her path, she could act like they never existed.


Still, when her eyes met Marc's-full of determination-she couldn't help but feel how absurd it all was.


Marc, of all people, knew her better than most, yet he was standing here, accusing her
of stealing his company's technology?


She had once hoped they could part peacefully. Clearly, Marc had no such intention.


"Oh, we've got proof," Haley snapped, her chin raised with confidence. "That proposal you're holding is all the evidence we need.Do you dare show your files and let the data team compare them?"


Stella looked Haley straight in the eye. "Why wouldn't I dare? But since you and Mr.Walsh are so eager to throw around accusations,how about this-if I prove | didn't take anything, you both owe me a public apology.And after that, stay the hell out of my life.Fair enough?"


"Deal," Haley snapped back without hesitation. "You should be nervous-using Marc's core tech to score this deal with SummitRise? You're nothing but a fraud."


Stella didn't get angry. Instead, she laughed under her breath. "Fine then. A deal's a deal.
Just don't forget-whoever loses pays the price."


She then turned toward Steven with a calm,professional tone. "Mr. Harrison, here's the tech l've prepared for your company's project. You're welcome to have your analysts compare it with Walsh Group's system. I'll let the data do the talking."


Steven, the man in charge at SummitRise,had a skilled team behind him. Running IP checks and analyzing overlapping tech structures was standard procedure for them.


He gave a brief nod and motioned to his assistant to begin the analysis.


Twenty minutes passed before the assistant quietly delivered the results to Steven's screen.



Steven read through the report, leaned back in his chair, and glanced at the group. "There is an issue with Ms. Gilbert's proposal," he stated.


Haley immediately let out a smug laugh,
turning to Stella with glee. "What did I say?It's obvious you stole the Walsh Group's tech. There's no way you created something this advanced on your own in just six months."



Marc remained seated on the sofa, with one leg crossed over the other, silently watching Stella with an intense gaze.


"Stella," he said gently. "I'll let this slide if you come home with me. We can act like none of this ever happened. I won't let the police get involved."


His tone was tender, almost noble, like he was doing her a favor for a crime she hadn't even committed.


But before Stella could reply, Steven cleared his throat a few times, his expression shifting as his eyes darkened slightly. "Actually, I'm not done talking yet," he said calmly.


Haley and Marc turned to face him again,confused.


Steven leaned forward slightly and spoke
with deliberate calm. "What I said was that there's an issue with Ms. Gilbert's submission, but I never claimed it had any overlap with Walsh Group's data. The issue is that her design is too advanced. Entirely original. Not a single element from Walsh Group appears in her system. I'm honestly...impressed. I was hoping to ask how she managed something so cutting-edge."


The revelation hit Marc and Haley like a thunderclap.


They stared at Steven in disbelief.



It didn't add up.



Hadn't Stella developed this more advanced system by enhancing her own patent, which was once licensed to the Walsh Group as their core technology?


How could her new system be entirely different?


"No! That's impossible!" Haley shouted, her voice shrill. "There has to be a mistake. She couldn't have developed something new on
her own-she had to copy us!"


She refused to accept that Stella might actually be that capable.


"What did you do, Stella? Did you bribe Steven? You must've used some dirty trick to get him on your side!" Haley's voice dripped with accusation, trying to twist the situation now that her plan had fallen apart.


Stella let out a light chuckle. "I'm done wasting energy explaining myself. There's always someone better out there, maybe that's what you can't accept. What now, Ms.Smith? Too proud to say you were wrong? lf you can't bring yourself to apologize, I'll just take legal action for defamation."


Haley clenched her jaw and glared daggers at Stella, her fury simmering just beneath the surface.



Meanwhile, Steven's tone turned icy as he spoke again. "Ms. Smith, what exactly are you suggesting? That SummitRise is rigging results? That we're conspiring against the
Walsh Group? Ms. Gilbert won this deal fairly.You and Mr. Walsh, on the other hand,stormed in without invitation and created chaos. I'd say it's your behavior that's out of line."



His words landed hard. For a moment, both Haley and Marc were too stunned to respond.


Just then, the assistant, who had been silently waiting at the door, tapped gently and stepped in to ease the tension. "Mr.Harrison, Mr. Sampson has arrived."
###Chapter 88 She Must Care About Him





"Let him in," Steven said with a nod.



Standing by the doorway, Kevin Sampson's expression was difficult to read. He had caught the tail end of everything that had just happened.


He had come to discuss a potential collaboration with Steven, but instead, he walked into the middle of a scandal, and a pretty revealing one at that.


It didn't take him long to recognize the man at thecenter of it all-Marc Walsh, from the Walsh Group.


Kevin had previously been leaning toward partnering with the Walsh Group, but with their patent no longer secure, he was already second-guessing that decision.


Haley, on the other hand, had been
leveraging her family's clout at Achury to push him toward going through with the deal.


Though he'd been wavering, Steven's remarks only solidified his decision. He was now firmly set on pulling out of the collaboration.


Marc looked up and froze when he saw Kevin at the entrance. The very investor he and Haley had been courting relentlessly.


"Mr. Sampson!" he exclaimed in shock.



Kevin's face remained unreadable. After a brief pause, he got straight to the point. "Mr.Walsh, since fate has brought us together here today, I'll give you my answer now.l won't be pursuing the collaboration with Walsh Group. If the stars align in the future,we might revisit it, but for now,I'm out."


After delivering his message, Kevin turned to Stella. Her poise amidst the chaos caught his attention. She hadn't flinched once.Intriguing, to say the least.
Even with everything unfolding around her,she radiated calm confidence-a quiet strength that hinted at success.


"Miss," Kevin began, "I overheard a bit about your technology earlier. It sounds promising.Would you be willing to share more details?"



Stella immediately recognized him-Kevin Sampson, the influential head of one of Briset's three major families.


Stella began to smile and offered her hand,but before she could say anything, Haley cut in,practically shouting, "Mr. Sampson, don't let her fool you! She's not who you think she is! We were supposed to collaborate-remember? You made a promise to me... and to my family!"


The moment she mentioned her family,Kevin's face clouded.


His tone sharpened as he interrupted, "Ms.Smith, you're standing on our soil now. I suggest you tread carefully. Don't let your family's influence abroad make you forget
where you are. Push too far, and you just might regret it."


Since when did the Sampson family bow to pressure from foreign interests?


Haley's face drained of color, and her hands balled into fists. "She's a fraud! Even her name's not real!"



That struck a chord.


For the first time, Stella's gaze turned icy.


"Ms. Smith," Stella said coolly. "What exactly is your connection to Mr. Walsh that makes you so invested in his problems?"


Without missing a beat, Haley declared,"Marc and I are together. I'm his girlfriend. Of course his business is mine, too!"


Upon hearing that, Stella turned to Marc with a look of mock surprise, her voice laced with sarcasm. "Oh? So it's official now?"



Marc's expression instantly darkened as he shot a sharp glare at Haley. His displeasure was obvious.
The moment she saw his reaction, Haley's confidence faltered. A flicker of unease crossed her face.


Deep down, she knew Marc had never truly seen her as a girlfriend.



But in front of Stella, she couldn't help herself-she had to stake her claim, even if it was just an illusion.


She had stayed by his side for six months and shared everything with him. Why shouldn't she be acknowledged as his girlfriend?


Noticing how Marc was clearly furious but trying to keep it in, Stella let out a soft,mocking laugh.



"I had no idea you two were a couple," she began, her tone drenched in sarcasm. "But didn't you just tell me at the party a few days ago that your heart belonged to your wife,Mr. Walsh? And now, suddenly, you've fallen for someone else? That was quick. From the looks of it, this doesn't seem like a
relationship-it seems more like an affair.Or maybe you both enjoy this kind of sneaky little drama. I may not know this 'Stella,' but whoever she is... I feel bad for her. Watching two people shamelessly parade around like soulmates? What a joke."


With both Kevin and Steven watching,Stella didn't bother with politeness. She tore straight through their carefully crafted facade.


Marc's face froze. But then something flickered behind his eyes.


Could this be jealousy? Was she upset because she still cared?



She had to care. Why else would she react like that to Haley's claim? That must've hurt.



His lips curled into a smile, mistaking her disgust for longing.


"You're jealous, aren't you, Stel?" he said smugly. "That's why you said all that. You can deny it all you want, but you're still my Stella."
###Chapter 89 Haven't I Been Good Enough To Her 




Stella shot Marc a look and rolled her eyes,clearly unimpressed by whatever nonsense he'd just said.



Even Steven, who'd been quietly observing from the sidelines, finally lost his patience and said, "Mr. Walsh, let's set the record straight-Ms. Gilbert isn't here as anyone's substitute. You've seen her ID. She's not your long-lost wife; she's Sylvia Gilbert,representing Nebula Group.


Frankly, your actual wife deserves better than a man who two-timed her. If you truly cared about her, you'd stop dragging innocent people into your mess and start paying attention to Ms. Smith.


The way things stand, Walsh Group and SummitRise Group have zero partnership now-and | can't see that changing. Mr.
Walsh, I think it's time for you to go."


Steven's voice made it clear he'd reached the end of his tolerance. Marc flushed,embarrassment burning on his face.


With the entire office watching him like he was a joke, he finally rose from the couch,every ounce of swagger gone.


As he shuffled past Stella, desperate for one last lifeline, he murmured her name, almost pleading, "Stel..."


But Stella didn't so much as glance in his direction, as if he'd vanished into thinair.



With her silence hanging heavy in the air,Marc hesitated briefly, then shoved the office door open and walked out.



Out in the car, Haley sat in the front seat,glancing nervously at Marc's thunderous expression. She inhaled shakily and tried to smooth things over with a brittle smile.


"Marc, honestly, SummitRise Group just lost out on something great. If they won't work
with us, that's their own misfortune-ah!"


Her words died in her throat. Marc, suddenly overcome with fury, lunged and wrapped his hand around her neck.



His grip tightened, his eyes burning with accusation. "Haley, was that deliberate? Why did you have to say that back in the office?"



Haley's eyelids fluttered shut, her face flushing red as she fought for air.



"Marc... I didn't mean to... please... let go..."


Marc flung her aside with a savage jerk,sending Haley's head crashing against the car window with a muffled crack.



"Out," he snapped, voice raw with fury.



Still gasping for air, Haley didn't dare linger.She fumbled with the handle, tumbled out of the car, and barely had time to steady herself before Marc roared off, the exhaust burning in her lungs.



Left in the fading taillights, Haley's rage boiled over. She stamped her foot into the
asphalt, eyes blazing.


That wretched Stella-none of this would've happened without her!



Marc headed straight for home, the tension in his knuckles refusing to ease. For weeks now, he'd poured himself into restoring the villa, determined to resurrect every detail from before Stella's departure.



Every corner, from the custom sofas to the precise arrangement of the bedroom furniture, looked untouched, as if she'd never left.


Even the wedding portrait Stella had burned -he'd commissioned an identical one,hanging it in its old place on the wall of the master bedroom.


Marc's gaze lingered on the portrait-Stella's hand resting on his arm, her smile warm and gentle. The image carved a fresh ache through his chest.


Memories of happier days crashed over him,each one clashing bitterly with her icy
indifference now.


He couldn't stand the reminder. Turning away, Marc yanked the bedroom door shut,the sound echoing through the empty villa.He didn't dare look back at anything that might unravel him. Minutes later, he sped off,leaving the villa behind once more.


The bar pulsed with deafening music, the kind that rattled the glassware and made conversation impossible. Marc sat hunched over the counter, tossing back one drink after another, desperate to drown out any trace of Stella from his mind.


Someone stepped out of the restroom and caught sight of him, hesitating for a moment before breaking into a surprised grin.


"Marc? Well, this is a surprise-| didn't expect to bump into you here!"



Marc hadn't joined them for a night out in more than half a year. Ever since his wife's sudden disappearance, he'd vanished from their social circle too.
Marc, bleary-eyed, glanced over and recognized his old friend, Travis Acosta.


Throwing an arm around Travis's shoulders,he chuckled, "Travis, look at that-what are the odds? Sit down, drink with me!"


Travis slid onto the stool beside him, brows knitting in concern. "Talk to me, man. What's going on?"


Marc shook his head, a bitter laugh escaping him. "What else could it be? Stella, as always."


"Wait-wasn't she... I thought she died.Marc, you're still hung up on her?" Travis asked,incredulous.


Marc slammed his glass down, voice rough."She's not dead. She's just out there,pretending to be someone else. Why?Wasn't I good to her? She's my wife-there's no substitute. What more does she want from me? I gave her everything. No one else could give her the life I did. If she left me,who's going to take care of her? Without me.
what does she even have? That thing with Haley, it's nothing-just a meaningless fling."
###Chapter 90 I'll Introduce You To Someone






Even now, Marc remained convinced he hadn't done anything wrong. In his mind,everything he'd done had been justified.


He simply saw it as part of business-getting close to other women was just strategy. But in his heart, Stella had always been the only one.



She had stood by him for years. Surely, she should've known his heart never wavered. At least, that's how Marc saw it.



And yet, here she was, using another name-Sylvia Gilbert, of all things-as if Stella Russell had never existed. To Marc, it was utterly ridiculous.


Travis had heard enough. "Marc," he cut in,his voice sharp. "The Walsh Group made it big in Choria thanks to Stella's patents. Do you have any idea how much those patents
could've gone for? But because she trusted you, she didn't ask for a dime."


It was no secret. Everyone in Choria knew where the success really came from.


Marc's face clouded over. He turned a hard stare on Travis. "What are you getting at?"


Travis hesitated, then exhaled. "Marc, let's be real. Without Stella, you'd have never made it here. Your reputation, your company's foothold in Choria-everything stems from her. A lot of those projects only worked with Walsh Group because of the tech she provided."



Marc's fingers clenched around his glass."Travis, if you're just here to talk nonsense,then shut your mouth."



Travis gave a slow shake of his head. "You're too close to see it clearly. This whole mess?It's on you."


Marc shot up from his seat, anger flashing in his eyes. "Oh, and now you're some moral high ground? Don't forget who you used to
be, Travis-you were no better than the rest of us."


Travis sighed and rose to leave. "Fine.I shouldn't have bothered. Enjoy your evening,Marc."


Without looking back, he walked away,silently thinking how Marc had no clue how much he owed Stella and how ungrateful he had become.


Marc's jaw tightened as he watched Travis walk out of the bar. After a long, tense pause,he leaned back slightly, lifted his glass, and swallowed the remaining liquor in one go.


The alcohol hit fast, clouding his mind with a dull haze. The music thundered around him,but all he could see was Stella-over and over again.


A deep ache clenched in his chest, sharp and suffocating, as though some invisible force had wrapped around his heart and refused to let go.

    
After she was thrown out of the car,Haley returned home. But she refused to give up.When he stopped answering her calls, she sent someone to track him down.


When she heard he was drinking alone at a bar, she rushed there immediately.



She pushed open the heavy door, scanning the dim room until her eyes landed on Marc,slouched over the counter.



Hurrying to his side, she looped her arm through his. "Marc, what are you doing?You've had too much-come on, let's get you home."



At the sound of her voice, Marc sluggishly turned his head. His vision was hazy, but when he saw the figure beside him, his expression softened. He reached out, fingers brushing her waist.


"Stel... you came back... don't leave me again... I love you, I always have..." he murmured, his words slurred but heartfelt.


Haley froze, as if someone had poured ice
water down her spine. Her hands trembled.So all this-every drink, every silent minute-was for Stella?


    



While all that was happening, Stella and Steven had smoothly finalized their Cooperation agreement.


Not wasting any time, Stella threw herself into work-organizing plans, going through the proposal from the planning team, and tweaking the key points before passing it on to William.


William flipped through the folder with sharp,focused eyes.


His expression didn't shift, but the moment he spotted the revisions, he knew exactly who had made them. Stella's touch was evident-subtle yet effective.


So,she wasn't just a pretty face with a story.She had real skill. No wonder Steven had taken an interest in her after only a couple of meetings.
Closing the file, William raised his head and looked at her. His voice was steady but laced with something colder. "Ms. Russell, now that you've joined Briggs Group, I expect you to create real value. I suggest you stop wasting time on distractions-people or matters that are irrelevant. We don't keep dead weight here. If you're drawing a paycheck, make sure you earn it."


Stella blinked, surprised by the sudden jab.



What was that supposed to mean?



Did he hear about Marc showing up earlier?


Was he calling her out over that? Or maybe he just liked dragging up her past, treating it like some stain that wouldn't wash off.


Still, she had worked hard-going through every detail, staying up late to polish that proposal. How could he accuse her of not creating value?


Her heart tightened, but she didn't let it show. Instead, she met his gaze with a calmer, colder tone.
"Mr. Briggs, I'm here to work, and I take my responsibilities seriously. But what I do in my personal life outside this office has nothing to do with you," she said steadily.


She didn't feel she owed anyone an apology.Everyone had a past. So did she. That didn't make her any less capable.


But her words made William's face turn slightly grim. So she was drawing a line now?


Did she think he'd just turn a blind eye if she flirted with Steven during working hours too?That wasn't something he was going to tolerate.


Stella kept her posture firm. She stood tall,head held high, not backing down. After a deep breath, she added, "If there's nothing else about the proposal, Mr. Briggs, I'd like to get back to work."


She turned as if to leave, but William's voice came again, low and direct. "Wait." She stopped.


"Your revisions were well done," he said.
"But Briggs Group isn't the same as the Walsh Group. You still have a lot to learn.I'll introduce you to someone."


Stella paused, then slowly turned back toward him. There was a slight frown on her brow, and her tone carried a hint of surprise."I didn't think you'd hand out compliments so easily. Who exactly is this person you want me to meet?"
###Chapter 91 Do You Like Me





William could tell she was bothered.



After working alongside her for half a year,he had come to understand that Stella wasn't as mild as she appeared.



She gave off a calm presence, but when pushed, she didn't hold back.


He said nothing about her earlier reaction.Instead, he reached into his drawer and pulled out a sleek envelope, placing it gently in front of her. "It's an invitation to Saul Vance's birthday banquet. He's the head of the Vance family in Sleka City."


The Vance family? Back when she was with Marc, she had heard of them more than once.



They were a longstanding powerhouse in Sleka, dominating their field, and meeting them wasn't something just anyone could arrange. Even Marc, considered one of
Choria's rising figures, had never had access to them.


"You want me to go with you?" she asked,unsure.


There had to be others in the company better suited for that kind of event, like his personal assistant.


W/illiam looked at her with a slight arch of his brow. "No. I want you to attend on my behalf."



She blinked, caught off guard by the answer.


"Don't you want to go?" His question snapped her back to the moment.


Stella quickly curved her lips into a smile. "If you trust me with it, I'd be glad to go. I just hope my limited knowledge of company matters won't embarrass us."



A chance like this didn't come often.


William lifted an eyebrow. "Get ready properly, and don't make me look bad."
Their eyes locked for a moment, and something unspoken passed between them.


He always gave off that air-unshaken,composed-as if nothing surprised him, as though no matter what she said, he'd already anticipated it.


Around him, her abilities felt insufficient.



Stella picked up the invitation and smiled."Got it. I'll handle it."







In Sleka, Stella stepped into Saul Vance's birthday banquet wearing a champagne-colored gown.


The room buzzed with conversation, the clatter of glasses, and soft music.


With a glass of juice in hand, she moved through the crowd, scanning for Saul.


Before she could find him, a few all-too-familiar faces caught her attention.


Haley and Beatrice stood close by, dressed
in coordinated lavender shades-one in a floor-length gown, the other in something shorter. They could've passed for sisters.


Stella sighed inwardly. Of all people to run into again...


She turned to walk away, pretending she hadn't noticed them.



But Haley caught a glimpse of her from the side while engaged in small talk.



Her hand gripped Beatrice's arm with sudden force. Beatrice turned toward the motion and spotted Stella too.



Her expression changed instantly. "Why is she here?" she muttered, her tone sharp.


Haley had already told her about Stella's so-called death. To them, Stella was a nuisance that never went away.


With her jaw tight and eyes burning, Haley stepped away from her group and strode straight toward Stella, blocking her way.


Haley leaned in slightly and said under her
breath, "What are you doing here, Stella?This is Saul Vance's banquet. You don't belong at an event like this."


Stella let out a soft chuckle and lifted an eyebrow. "Ms. Smith, I've said it before, my name is Sylvia Gilbert. As for where I choose to go, that's really none of your business.Unless... you've taken an interest in me? Like me,perhaps?"


Haley's cheeks burned with fury. "You can stop pretending. Call yourself Sylvia all you want, but I know exactly who you are. You're not that important. Why would I ever like someone like you? You hang onto powerful men like it's a job. What's appealing about that? So, which man brought you here tonight? You showing up at Saul's party is a disgrace to the guest list."


To Haley, this was the perfect opportunity to trample Stella underfoot.


Her family had close ties with the Vance family and had stayed in touch ever since their days together in Achury.
Even if the situation escalated, Haley believed Saul Would take both her side and her mother's.


Stella's playful tone faded, replaced by a sharp, cold look. "Ms. Smith, did you skip brushing your teeth this morning? The smell is a bit much. I've had a bit of spare time lately, so l did a little research. Turns out,there's something quite interesting. Ms.Smith, your hatred for Stella runs deep,is it because you've been with her husband and hoped to replace her?"


Stella's accusation sent a ripple through the nearby guests.


A woman of Haley's social standing, exposed as someone's mistress? The shock was immediate.

















###Chapter 92 Embarrassment




This was Sleka. Here, gossip about Choria barely made it past a whisper.


Haley's expression twisted. "What nonsense are you saying?"


Stella gave a calm, deliberate smile."I found out that Ms. Russell once reported you and Marc to the police. Not just for cheating behind her back,but for stealing her patent, too. Pretty sure there's still a record of it sitting at the station.lt caused quite a stir back then. Funny how you walked out of it all without a scratch. I'm guessing your family had to pull some serious strings, huh?And now, here you are, still obsessing over a woman who's been gone for ages. What's your real angle,Ms. Smith?"


The crowd started whispering. And it wasn't in Haley's favor.


"Isn't she that wealthy heiress from Achury?What's she doing here playing the mistress? Her family must be mortified."


"Rich? Please. Ever hear the saying 'the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree'? Maybe her mom wasn't much better-how else would she end up like this?"


"Poor Stella. Who knows, maybe she was killed by Haley and that dirtbag husband of hers."



Haley and Beatrice could hear every word. The sneers, the judgment-it all hit like a slap in the face.


Haley snapped, her voice shrill. "Stella, stop making up lies! You just can't stand that Marc's moved on. He doesn't love you anymore! You were the one clinging to him! You disappeared for six months hoping he'd chase after you-and when he didn't, you crawled back with a new name,hoping to win him over again. Pathetic."


"I'l say this one last time," Stella said, voice steady and cold. "My name is Sylvia Gilbert,not Stella Russell." Her expression darkened. "Ms.Smith, not everyone settles for scraps like you do.Maybe Marc's a prize in your eyes, but to the rest of us? He's trash."


She had let go of her feelings for Marc a long time ago. In fact, looking back, she regretted ever wasting years on him.


All those empty promises-she'd been blind.
"Stella, who are you calling trash?!" Haley couldn't take it. The moment she heard someone insult Marc-especially Stella-she lost it.


She lunged at her, hand raised to slap.


But Stella wasn't about to just stand there and let it happen.


She smoothly dodged, stepping aside just as Haley came swinging.


Problem was, Haley was in stilettos-heels at least ten centimeters high-and after missing her mark, she stumbled hard, landing flat on the floor in the most awkward, ridiculous way.


Her face contorted into a half-shocked, half-pained grimace.


People around them covered their mouths,bursting into laughter.


Beatrice's face turned stone-cold. She'd come to this event hoping to land a deal with the Vance family, but they hadn't even gotten to the negotiation table and were already a walking joke.






In the lounge nearby, Saul was seated at a chessboard, deep in thought. He moved a pawn
with a focused hand, totally absorbed in the game.


It was his birthday today, and he'd finally found a chess partner worth playing with.


Across from him, William glanced over at the surveillance monitor set up in the corner of the room.



The screen showed a clear feed of the banquet hall-right in time to catch Haley's fall in front of Stella.



He smirked, clearly entertained. Stella had really come a long way.


Turning his attention back to the game, he chuckled softly. "Your game's gotten better."


Saul beamed at the compliment. "Been practicing ever since our last match."


William made his next move, sliding a knight into position, blocking Saul's bishop.


He spoke casually, eyes still on the board. "Saul, if I'm not mistaken... Haley and Beatrice-aren't they your relatives?" His tone was light, almost amused, as he waited for Saul's next move.
###Chapter 93 Protecting Your Girlfriend





Saul paused mid-move, a chess piece in hand,his expression tightening. "Barely relatives," he muttered. "Haven't seen either of them in over ten years."


William already knew the background. Haley had stayed in Achury all her life,while Saul had built his world in Sleka. They might've shared some blood, but there wasn't much of a bond.


"But today's your birthday, and they made a point to show up," William said casually. "Looks like they're trying to gain some favor."


Especially after how they embarrassed themselves back in Choria-it wouldn't be surprising if they were here trying to clean up their image.


That clearly rubbed Saul the wrong way. He hadn't been strict with the guest list today;anyone who wanted to celebrate was welcome.


But if Haley and Beatrice were here just to cozy up and benefit off his name? They were set up for a big surprise.
"They can keep dreaming." The sharpness in his voice made his stance crystal clear-he wasn't about to let them take advantage of him.


He rarely visited Achury, and even if he did,he wouldn't need Haley to accompany him.


"I mean," William continued, "they're already causing a scene. Your birthday celebration's at risk of turning into a circus. Haley just took a tumble out there. Sure, it's her own embarrassment, but if things keep escalating,your whole party could get derailed."


Saul shot a glance at the monitor, clearly irritated,then moved his bishop without a word.


William moved his queen, smirking. "Checkmate.Looks like I won this round."


Saul tore his gaze away from the screen, scanned the board, and let out a scoff. "You crafty bastard."


William had been rattling on about Haley and her mother's social-climbing to distract him-and it had worked.


He'd fallen for it and made a bad move.



Not many people could match Saul in chess, and even fewer dared to sit across from him.
William was one of the few who could go toe-to-toe with him on the board.


But this win? It didn't sit right with Saul.



"You set me up for your little office crush? This round doesn't count. Let's go again."


William didn't argue. He just started resetting the board,but added, "She's not my girlfriend. She works at Briggs Group. I just value her skills."


Saul didn't believe a word.


There were many employees at Briggs Group, but William had never openly backed anyone like this.



But he wasn't about to admit it.



Saul rolled his eyes. "Anyway, enough of that. One more game. And no distractions this time. I'll take care of those two outside."


William laughed under his breath. "Fine by me."


Once the board was reset, Saul waved at the butler standing quietly behind them. "Go handle it. This is my birthday. If anyone causes a ruckus,toss them out. No exceptions."


The butler gave a small bow. He'd heard everything and didn't need more instructions.
"Yes, sir. I'll take care of it right away."


With that, he left the room. Saul relaxed and leaned back in his chair. "Now, can we finally focus on this match?"


William didn't answer-just moved a pawn forward.







Outside, Haley was still fuming, barely steady on her feet as Beatrice helped her up. She glared daggers at Stella. "You really think you can humiliate me and walk away? Do you even know who my father is? We're here for Saul Vance's birthday-I'll have you kicked out of here in seconds!"


She shoved Beatrice's hand away and made to charge at Stella again.


But before her raised hand could come down,a cold voice rang out.


"Who dares to make a scene at Mr. Vance's birthday?" It was Terence, the Vance family's butler.


He stepped between Haley and Stella like a wall.



Haley scowled. "And who do you think you are?"
Terence didn't flinch. His expression was calm,but there was an unmistakable edge to his tone.


When Saul went abroad to recuperate, he had been busy managing domestic affairs and hadn't gone along, unaware of how arrogant the Smith family was.


"I'm Terence Ramsey. Butler to the Vance family.And when I speak, I speak on behalf of Mr. Vance himself." The room went quiet.


He continued, voice firm, "Miss Gilbert is a distinguished guest of the Vance family. Anyone who disrespects her-disrespects us. And Mr.Vance doesn't tolerate disrespect in his home."


Everyone around froze in shock.



Terence Ramsey? The butler of the Vance family?


That meant Mr. Vance was Saul himself.


Just moments ago, Haley had been flaunting her so-called family connection to the Vances. But now? Saul was openly backing Sylvia.
###Chapter 94 Three Slaps




Haley's eyes widened in disbelief. "That's ridiculous! Why would Saul defend her of all people? She shouldn't even have the right to be here!"


Terence's tone turned sharp as he replied, "Ms.Gilbert was personally invited by Mr. Vance. Is that an issue for you, Ms. Smith? Or do you think he needed your permission before sending his guests an invitation?"


At this moment, he was speaking on behalf of Saul himself.



Even though Haley was upset, she didn't have the courage to go against him. She pressed her lips together, preparing to walk away.


But just then, Terence called out, stopping her in her tracks. "Ms. Smith, hold on. You were quite rude to Ms. Gilbert earlier. Mr. Vance would like you to apologize to her right now."


His tone was steady and clear, loud enough for everyone in the room to hear.


Haley froze mid-step and spun around, staring at
Terence in disbelief. "Excuse me? You expect me to apologize to her?"


With her background, she saw no reason to lower herself and apologize to Stella.


"Yes. Now," Terence confirmed, his tone cool and composed.


Haley's temper flared as her face turned red with rage. "That's never going to happen! Are you insane? We're Saul's family! And you want me to apologize to someone who climbed her way up through men?"


Terence moved slightly to stand protectively in front of Stella, his voice still steady. "If you can't offer an apology, then I'm afraid you'll have to leave. You're not welcome here."


Ever since she returned to the country, Beatrice had been humiliated time and again because of Stella, and nowN she finally lost her temper.



Her expression turned stormy as she turned to Terence with a sharp, scornful glare. "You get to decide we're not welcome in the Vance family?Don't flatter yourself. You'rejust an employee-who do you think you are, giving us orders like that?
Hearing that, a flicker of contempt passed through Terence's gaze. "I'm simply relaying Mr.Vance's exact words. If there's no apology to MAs.Gilbert, you're no longer welcome as guests of the Vance family."


Beatrice's eyes burned with anger as she stared at him, but she didn't act rashly.


If Saul had really given the order, then making a scene now would only mean losing the Vance family's support in Sleka-a cost far too great.


Yet lowering themselves to apologize would be humiliating...people would talk.


Stuck in a bitter dilemma, Beatrice clenched her jaw and gave Haley a subtle nod.


After all, the Vance name carried too much weight. They had come here to make allies, not throw everything away because of someone like Stella.


Left with no other option, Haley swallowed her pride and lowered her head in a stiff, reluctant gesture. "| apologize, Ms. Ru-Gilbert," she muttered through gritted teeth. "I crossed the line earlier. I hope you'll be generous enough to let it go."
Terence added calmly, "And one more thing, Ms.Smith. Earlier, you tried to strike Ms. Gilbert. The Vance family believes in fairness, and that includes letting Ms. Gilbert return the gesture.What you tried to do, she has every right to return."


Haley's heart sank. She had thought the forced apology was already the peak of humiliation, but now-this?


She stared at Terence as if he'd lost his mind."I didn't even hit her! She's not hurt, so why should I just stand there and let her slap me?"


But Terence only smiled. "In that case, you may leave. Mr. Vance has made it clear-you're not welcome here."



Haley's fury bubbled up, ready to erupt, but before she could unleash it, Beatrice reached out and grabbed her arm.


The warning in Beatrice's gaze was sharp and immediate. Haley froze. She understood instantly -this wasn't just about ego anymore.


Her father's company in Achury had been treading on thin ice lately, and they couldn't afford to burn bridges, especially not with someone like Saul Vance.
His influence overseas could be the lifeline they needed.


If getting slapped by Stella meant they'd still geta chance to speak to Saul, then so be it. Her mother would help her settle the score later anyway.


Haley clenched her jaw and forced her voice out."Fine."



Terence gave a satisfied nod and stepped back,respectfully turning the stage over. "Ms. Gilbert,I'll leave the rest to you."


Stella, who had silently watched the entire exchange unfold, found herself genuinely curious.


She didn't even know Saul Vance personally,so why was he standing up for her so directly?



Was it simply that even Saul couldn't stomach Haley's arrogance? Or... was someone quietly backing her?


Either way, she had no intention of letting this chance slip by.


Her eyes gleamed as she gave Terence a slight nod, then turned to face Haley.


Without hesitation, she raised her hand and
delivered a clean, loud slap to Haley's cheek."That's for confusing me with someone else," she said coldly. Another slap followed without pause."That's for thinking you can act high and mighty wherever you go."


And then came the final one-harder than the rest, echoing across the room. "And that... is for your disgraceful lack of shame."


Each slap landed with reason, leaving Haley with no room to argue.



Haley was left stunned. Her trembling hand covered her stinging cheek as tears welled up and rolled down uncontrollably. All she could do was stand there, humiliated beyond words.
###Chapter 95 A Counterfeit





Stella waved her hand with a sharp flick, her expression dripping with contempt. "Ms. Smith,those three slaps were just a taste of what you'll get if you ever try spewing garbage in front of me again.Next time, you won't be so lucky."


Haley pressed her hands to her stinging cheeks and fled in tears.


Beatrice cast a frosty look in Stella's direction before turning to leave as well.



With the scene finally over, the onlookers quietly drifted away, and Terence headed upstairs to make his report.


Halfway through the banquet, the host, Saul,appeared at the top of the staircase.


Dressed in a rich blue suit, he radiated a vigorous energy that belied the silver streaks in his hair.



As Saul descended the staircase, guests immediately clustered around him, their faces beaming with flattery.


"Happy birthday, Mr. Vance!"
"Many more years of good health and fortune, Mr.Vance!"


The chorus of well-wishes echoed throughout the hall, but Stella lingered quietly at the back,unfazed by the excitement swirling around her.


Haley and Beatrice, catching sight of Saul at last,lit up with anticipation.


Determined to be first, Haley shoved past the crowd, clutching her gift tightly, her stinging cheek forgotten in her eagerness.


She stepped up to Saul and offered the box with both hands. "Saul, I picked out something special for you-a vintage tobacco pipe. I searched everywhere for it. It's one of a kind."


Her words earned a few surprised looks from the crowd.



Everyone in the city knew Saul's weakness for antiques.


By choosing an old tobacco pipe, Haley had clearly played to his tastes-there was no doubt this gift would hit the mark.


Saul accepted the box, lifted the lid, and regarded the contents with a measured gaze.
After only a moment, he snapped tne pox snul,his face unreadable. "Take it away and put it with the others."


Seriously,that was how it ended?


Disappointment flashed in Haley's eyes as she exchanged a look with Beatrice, confused by Saul's impassive reaction.


Had the tobacco pipe failed to impress him after all?



Earlier, she'd pictured Saul lighting up with joy-she'd even planned to take the chance to whisper her grievances about Stella.


Instead, his face gave nothing away, leaving Haley at a loss, uncertain and unwilling to risk any playful gestures.


Haley, jittery and desperate to deflect Saul's irritation, scanned the room for an easy target.


Her gaze landed on Stella, who lingered quietly at the back of the crowd.


A sly spark ignited in Haley's eyes as she raised her voice. "Ms. Gilbert, since you've come all this way for the birthday banquet, I'm sure you've prepared a meaningful gift for Saul, haven't you?He did speak up for you earlier-why not take this
chance to show everyone your present?"


The crowd shifted, parting to give Stella space as every pair of eyes fell on her.


With everyone watching, Stella moved forward with steady composure, her features unflinching and serene.


She approached Saul and offered her gift with measured grace.



"Our Briggs Group prepared this gift for you, Mr.Vance-wishing you strength and longevity."


When Saul lifted the lid, a gleaming amber tobacco pipe rested inside, catching the light with a warm, golden glow.


Amber, often called the jewel of time, was exceptionally rare. Stella had unearthed this particular ten-thousand-year-old specimen during her work at the research institute,making it all the more extraordinary.


Given Saul's seventy-six years, Stella's offering carried a subtle message: may his life remain steady and enduring, like the ancient amber,imbued with depth and meaning.


Saul's brows inched upward, ready to respond,when Haley let out a disdainful laugh. "Amber?
Please. That's just a chunk of resin-totally worthless. You'd find piles of this stuff at any street stall, and only you, Ms. Gilbert,would have the nerve to give something so cheap to Saul.Aren't you worried people are laughing behind your back? Honestly, this isn't even good enough to leave outside as a decoration. If I were Briggs Group, I'd be embarrassed to have you on my team."


Stella glanced over her shoulder, the corners of her mouth tilting into a cold, almost amused smile.



Haley wasn't just rude; her words betrayed her complete lack of sense.


Right then, Saul spoke up, his tone deliberate and clear. "This is wonderful-I'm very fond of it.Terence, bring it up to my study. I'd like to keep it close so I can see it every day."


Terence offered a respectful nod, handling the amber tobacco pipe wvith care as he took it from Stella, his expression solemn.


Haley froze in disbelief, mirroring the surprise etched on everyone else's faces.


How could a simple amber trinket win Saul over so completely?
Haley and Beatrice traded a look, each scowling in silent frustration.


"Saul, why..." Haley faltered, her voice rising."Didn't you like the antique I picked out? What's so special about this amber? If you're fond of it,I can get you plenty more!"


She couldn't accept it-the tobacco pipe had taken real effort for her and Beatrice to track down,yet somehow Stella's gift had stolen all the attention.



What had Stella possibly done to earn Saul's admiration so effortlessly?


Saul shot Haley a look brimming with annoyance.



He couldn't stand her tactless, dim-witted behavior.


If not for the Smith family's remote connection to him, neither Haley nor Beatrice would have set foot past his threshold.


He dismissed her with complete indifference,not sparing her another glance.


Breaking the awkward silence, Stella's voice came across soft and composed. "Ms. Smith, it's not that Mr. Vance disliked your gift. The issue is,the tobacco pipe you brought... appears to be a
counterfeit."
###Chapter 96 A Fake




A fake?


Haley's face twisted in outrage. "What are you talking about? Don't be ridiculous! I spent a fortune on that! There's no way it's fake." She turned to Saul, trying to reel him back in. "Mr.Vance, she's just talking nonsense. She's not even an expert. Don't let her fool you!"


In her mind, Stella was just jealous-trying to ruin her moment, especially in front of Saul.


But Saul? He looked at Stella with nothing but admiration.



He'd been watching everything from the lounge,including the moment Stella slapped Haley three times.


And he didn't think she was being petty-he thought she had excellent judgment.


She struck when she needed to, kept calm when it counted, and handled herself far better than Haley ever could.


It wasn't hard to see why William was backing her.
one doesn't match any of them. For starters, real medieval pipes were almost always carved from wood. This one is supposedly made from briar,but that's not the natural color of briar wood.Whoever faked it clearly didn't know much about the material. Also, the shape is just... wrong. Look at the angle-it's off. And the sides aren't even symmetrical."


Saul listened quietly, clearly impressed.


He loved antique pipes.


And everything Stella said? She was spot on. Real antique pipes were meticulously crafted. The bowl was never perfectly vertical, and when split down the middle, the two sides were usually mirror images.


They were handcrafted, demanding high craftsmanship.


But this one? The color was off, the angle awkward,and the symmetry-nonexistent.


Anyone who actually knew about pipes would spot it immediately.


Who would've thought Stella knew her antiques so well?


The pipe was placed on the table for everyone to
see.


One by one, people leaned in to inspect it based on Stella's points. Sure enough-the flaws were obvious.


This pipe really seemed to be fake.



"This pipe really does look fake. No wonder Mr.Vance didn't look impressed when he opened it earlier."


"Exactly. He's a collector. He must've noticed but didn't want to embarrass Haley right away."


The whispers around the room hit Haley like slaps. Her ears burned with shame.


She didn't even know it was fake.


Haley turned toward her mother, silently begging for help.


With the situation having escalated to this point,she didn't know what to do.


Beatrice caught her look and quickly stepped forward, putting on her best smile. "Mr. Vance,there must've been some mistake. We had no idea the pipe wasn't genuine. But our intentions were sincere. When you stayed in Achury, we took such good care of you-surely you don't
think we'd do something ündernanaea, louay s your birthday. Why let someone from outside the family stir up drama? Isn't that what's really going on here?"


She dropped the "Achury" reference deliberately,hoping Saul would soften up.


After all, they were technically relatives, and she was reminding him they'd once hosted him generously-hoping he'd return the favor with some leniency.
###Chapter 97 What Kind Of Man Do You Like





Saul's brows knitted together as he shot her a sharp look. "Outsider? If something from an outsider is more to my liking than your cheap knockoff,then I'll take it-no questions asked."


Beatrice's expression froze. Se clearly hadn't expected him to be so direct.


Haley, growing flustered, tried to salvage the moment. "It's just an amber tobacco pipe, Saul.If you like it, I can send over a few more."


"Just an amber tobacco pipe?" Saul scoffed,already losing patience. "Do you have any idea how rare fossilized amber is? Or how difficult it is to carve an authentic piece like this? This isn't something you toss around like party favors."


Haley was stunned. How did Stella manage to get her hands on something so rare and expensive?


She clenched her jaw, unable to accept yet another defeat, but no words came out.


Saul turned his eyes from Beatrice to Stella, his tone much gentler now. "Ms. Gilbert, I really liked
the gift you gave me. Wouid you mlnu takiny a walk with me in the garden? I'd like to have a quick word with you in private."


Stella was here on William's behalf, mainly to discuss business collaboration.



But now, with Saul personally requesting a chat,she gave a polite smile and nodded. "I'd be glad to."



Haley and Beatrice stood still, watching Stella leave with Saul. Jealousy burned in their eyes-they were so bitter, it seemed like they might explode. At that moment, they both wished they could tear Stella apart.


As Stella passed them, she let out a soft, mocking chuckle, clearly unfazed.


So what if Haley came from a noble family in Achury? A name alone couldn't cover up shallow roots and dull minds.


Stella walked alongside Saul through the back garden when her gaze caught a quick-moving figure in the distance.


It vanished too fast to identify, but something
about it felt strangely familiar.


Could that have been William?



The idea popped into her mind, but she quickly dismissed it.


If William were here, he wouldn't have sent her instead.


She shook her head slightly. Maybe she was just overthinking it.


Saul noticed where she was looking, his gaze turning thoughtful. But he said nothing, simply smiling. "You're here on business today,I take it?"



Stella answered without delay. "Yes. I'm here on behalf of Briggs Group. Mr. Vance, if youI give us a shot, I'm confident both parties will benefit."


Her tone was poised, respectful, and unmistakably confident.


Saul chuckled softly and changed the subject."With your talent, Ms. Gilbert, I imagine you've got plenty of admirers. Are you seeing anyone?"



Stella blinked in surprise, unsure where this was heading. But she answered plainly, "You're too
kind,Mr.Vance. No, I'm not dating anyone."


"Really? Then what kind of man do you like? I happen to know several excellent bachelors. I'd be happy to make an introduction."


Was he trying to set her up? Stella politely declined without missing a beat. "I appreciate the offer, but my focus right now is completely on work. I'm not in a place to think about romance."


Saul noted her resolute tone and pressed his lips together in thought.


He thought back to William's composed strategy during their earlier board game. At the time, he had assumed William was the predator and Stella the prey.


But now, the roles weren't so clear anymore. How amusing.


They resumed talking business, and Saul seemed pleased, eventually agreeing to the partnership with Briggs Group.


With her mission accomplished, Stella politely excused herself.



Outside the hall, just as she reached the roadside,

a car rolled up from the underground garage.



She narrowed her eyes. That car... it looked very familiar.



The car slowed to a stop right in front of her, the window rolled down, and there he was. William.



Stella's gaze sharpened. So that shadow earlier...was it really him after all?
###Chapter 98 | Want It





"What a coincidence, Mr. Briggs. What brings you driving out of the Vance family's garage?" Stella asked, her voice calm but laced with surprise.


She had worked so hard to help him secure that deal, only to find out he'd been at the banquet the whole time.


Was he meeting with Saul behind her back?


Did he not trust her to handle it?


A strange sense of being sidelined crept over her,like she'd been underestimated.



William glanced at her, his tone easygoing. "If |hadn't shown up today, do you really think you could've walked out of that party without trouble?"


He looked pointedly at her. "Haley and Beatrice may not have the power they used to, but they're still capable of stirring the pot. With their background, causing chaos for you wouldn't be hard."


Stella blinked, caught off guard. "So...you were
the one who sent the butler to help me? And... Mr.Vance agreeing to work with me-was that because of you too?"


That last part came out softer, more hesitant.



William's expression shifted, something unreadable flickering in his eyes. "Are you doubting yourself?"


Sure, Saul was an old friend, but that didn't mean he made business decisions based on friendship.



If it hadn't been for Stella's solid proposal and technical edge, Saul wouldn't have been impressed.


She wasn't some charity case. Just being associated with William wasn't enough to swing deals like that.


Stella rushed to correct herself. "No-I mean,of course not.I just thought..."


"Thought what?" William cut in, raising an eyebrow.


She paused, embarrassed. He had gone out of his way to support her, and here she was questioning his motives-again.


It kind of made her look like a jerk.
Her voice dropped to an embarrassed whisper.


"I just thought... well, I was that good, you know?

Knew I'd make it for sure.Haha..."



William gave her a long, unreadable look.


Then, casually-as if talking about the weather-he dropped the real news. "The earlier negotiation with Steven, and today's deal with Saul-both were tests. You passed. So now I'm handing Nebula over to you."


Stella stared at him like he'd just grown wings."You're giving Nebula...to me?"


She'd only been at Briggs Group for, what-less than a month?


Sure, Nebula was still a startup, but it had serious potential.


Every project under its name was rock-solid, and feedback from partners had been nothing but glowing.


And now he was handing it to her?



"Why?" she asked, still stunned.


First a black card, now a company? He was being too generous.
William slid into the seat beside her, studying her with quiet intensity. "You always question things.But when you do-what kind of answer are you hoping to hear? What would finally calm that restless little mind of yours?"


Stella froze. She stared at him, mouth slightly open,heart thudding against her ribs.


What was she hoping to hear? The air between them shifted.



The next second, William straightened,checked his phone, and said flatly, "But if you're not confident, forget it. Pretend I never mentioned it."


"Wait,wait-who said I wouldn't take it?" Stella blurted, snapping upright. "Why are you so quick to take it back, Mr. Briggs?"


"Some things are better settled fast," he replied,barely moving his lips, his tone unusually soft.


Stella muttered three simple words. "I want it."


He looked right at her, his gaze uncomfortably intense.


Stella's cheeks turned red instantly. The car suddenly felt way too warm.


Flustered, she reached for the window switch,
trying to breathe, when the car hit a small bump.She lost her balance and fell forward-right onto William's chest.


She blinked. The man was built like a damn rock.



He said nothing, just looked down at her sprawled on him with an unreadable expression.


"Old trick," he muttered dryly.


It seemed she had a knack for finding ways to fall onto him.



Embarrassed, Stella coughed awkwardly and tried to push herself up-but instead of finding solid ground,her hand landed squarely on his thigh.


Her palm slipped. She fell again. This time, the landing spot was... awkward. William's eyes narrowed slightly. He let out a small grunt of pain,his jaw tightening.


Stella turned crimson. She knew exactly what part of him she'd landed on.


Mortified, she scrambled off him and flattened herself against the car door like a guilty cat. "I-I'm so sorry, Mr. Briggs! I didn't mean to-really,I didn't!"


She sounded like she was reciting a formal
apology letter, and William still hadn't said a word.


His silence only made it worse. She didn't even dare to look at him until the car finally rolled to a stop outside her villa.


She practically jumped out of the car. "Thank you,Mr. Briggs. And sorry again. Have a good night!"


Three polite phrases. One breath.


She turned and started walking, but then-click-she heard another door shut behind her. She turned, confused. William had gotten out too.


"Um... Mr. Briggs, you really don't need to walk me in..." Stella unlocked the door with her fingerprint, but before she could finish her sentence, William slipped inside, right behind her.
###Chapter 99 Your Caregiving Skills Didn't Disappoint





Stella frowned, "Is there any additional assistance you require from me?"


William glanced around the room before meeting her eyes again.



A small smile tugged at his lips. "I'm famished. Go cook something for me."


She stared at him, completely thrown off.



Was he actually treating her like a personal chef?



"I skipped the food at the banquet," he added smoothly. "And I just handed you a company. Ms.Russell, surely you won't let me go hungry after that?"


She could hardly believe what she was hearing.Part of her wanted to throw something at him.



But after a moment, she calmed herself. William had been unusually helpful today. He said Saul signed because of her skills, but she knew the reputation of Briggs Group had played a role too.
Stella exhaled slowly and convinced herself to let it slide-she could treat it as a small gesture of gratitude.


She walked into the kitchen, checked the fridge for ingredients, and lit the stove to start cooking.


From the living room, William listened to the gentle clatter of dishes and the soft hiss of the stove. He turned slightly to watch her move around in an apron, and for a brief moment, a calmness settled over him.


For a fleeting moment, she looked like the perfect image of a homemaker.


A few minutes later, Stella set down a plate of spaghetti. "This is all there was. You'll have to settle for it."


She half-expected him to turn his nose up at the dish, but he simply picked up the fork and began eating.


He didn't say a word, chewing with quiet precision, even managing to make spaghetti look refined.


Once he'd cleared the plate, Stella took it back into the kitchen. She figured she'd clean it properly the next day.
But when she returned, William was still sprawled on the sofa. She raised a brow. "You're not leaving?"


Reclining with one leg crossed over the other, he replied in a relaxed tone, "The chef at my place quit recently-family problems. The replacement isn't exactly working out."


Stella gave him a puzzled look and spread her hands."So?"


How was that her problem?


"You cooked something edible. Slightly better than what I've been dealing with. I've decided to stay here for a while, at least until I hire someone who can actually cook."


Her eyes went wide.


The two of them... under the same roof?


That couldn't be real.



William, watching her expression shift, added in a low voice, "Calm down. I'm not going to touch you. Unless... you think I might. Is that what's making you nervous, Ms. Russell?"


A chill crept down her spine, but after a moment of silence, she looked straight at him. "Where did
you get that idea? I wasn't thinking anything at all."


William studied her reaction with quiet amusement. Her slight fluster didn't escape him."Good," he said, his lips curving faintly. "Then it's settled. Get steak tomorrow. I'm craving it."


With that, he stood up and walked toward the guest room.


This villa had originally belonged to him, so he moved around comfortably, not needing any help from Stella.



She stood still, watching his tall frame disappear down the hallway, and suddenly snapped out of her daze, irritation bubbling up.



What did he mean by saying "it was settled"?


She never agreed to anything!



But... he was technically her superior. And this house had once been his.


He had given her Nebula as well as the house.



Being generous wasn't so bad. If he wanted to stay for a while, she supposed she could tolerate
With a resigned sigh, Stella climbed the stairs.As she passed the window on her way up, something outside caught the corner of her eye, a flicker of light.


Frowning, she turned to look. Nothing. Maybe she was just imagining things.






At the Walsh estate, Marc stood seething,gripping a stack of surveillance photos from his investigator. With a roar of fury, he swept everything off his desk.


The photos clearly showed William and Stella entering the same villa-and not leaving. More than an hour later, only William's driver exited the property,alone.


There was no mistaking what this meant, William had spent the night at Stella's place.


And she still had the audacity to claim there was nothing between them?


He had been convinced Haley was just stirring trouble, but now it looked like Stella really had landed herself a powerful man. And that man was William.


Marc's fury simmered well into the night,keeping
sleep far out of reach.


Elsewhere, Stella rose early to prepare breakfast.


She kept it simple: sandwiches and black coffee.


William joined her not long after. He took a bite,then cast a sideways look at her and said with a smirk, "Ms. Russell, you're surprisingly competent at this. The flavor... suits me."


Stella shot him a cold look and silently continued eating.


Once breakfast was over, William headed to the bathroom, and Stella followed right behind him."Wait-do you even have your own toothbrush?Or a towel? I don't have any spares here. The ones hanging up are mine, and don't think you can just use them!"


Her scolding drew a low laugh from William."Ms.Russell, you're starting to sound like my mother.I'm going to shower-unless you plan on helping again?"


Stella was speechless. She spun on her heel and walked out, refusing to entertain the comment. A moment later, the sound of water echoed from the bathroom.


That moment had been ages ago. Why was he 
still bringing it up? Was he really going to hold onto that memory forever?





###Chapter 100 Drag Him Away




William finished getting ready and grabbed his coat, clearly about to head out. Stella stayed put on the couch, making no move to see him off.



At the door, William said casually, "Had a new car delivered last night. It's yours to use when you go out."



Only then did Stella glance over and notice the Ferrari keys sitting neatly on the entryway table.


Her lips twitched. They'd just argued this morning, but somehow, she was walking away with a Ferrari. Not bad.


"Well then. Thanks, Mr. Briggs," she said, voice dry but not uungrateful.


About half an hour after Williamleft, Stella finished tidying up and decided to head out herself.


She grabbed the keys, unlocked the car, slid into the driver's seat, and buckled up in one smooth motion.


Just as she was about to drive off, her eyes
caught movement near the gate.


She squinted.Marc.


She instantly rolled her eyes, hard. Without hesitation, she slammed her foot on the gas.


Marc had been lurking since early morning. He saw William leave, then Stella step out alone.Fueled by impulse and whatever false sense of entitlement he had left, he moved in front of the car to block her path.


But he hadn't expected Stella to be so ruthless;even with him standing in front of her car, she showed no hesitation in pressing thegas pedal.


As the car sped toward him, he panicked and dove to the side, narrowly avoiding a real-life accident.


"Stella! I'm your husband! Are you seriously trying to run me over?! You want to see me dead or what?!"


Stella rolled the window down, her gaze sharp and her voice full of disdain. "Mr. Walsh, are you hard of hearing or just stupid? You block my car first thing in the morning-what do you think was going to happen?"


She leaned an elbow casually on the window
frame. "I was just giving you what you clearly wanted. You got in my way. Don't act like the victim now."


Marc's expression twisted in frustration. "Stel,how long are you gonna keep up this act?"


Stella scoffed. "Mr. Walsh, you should probably go see a doctor. I've told you a hundred times-I'm not Stella. Maybe your brain's broken, but are your ears busted too?"


Marc, clearly fed up, yanked at her car door,but she'd locked it. Of course she had.


His eyes flicked to the car-a Ferrari-and the jealousy hit like a punch. William had bought her that.


"You and William-this whole thing's just to get back at me, isn't it? How can you let a car can your loyalty? I'm your husband, for God's sake!"He was practically shaking.


William might have bought her a car, but Marc had given her all his love.


Why was she being so heartless and kept pushing him away?


Stella's face turned cold. Her voice rose. "Mr.Walsh, I'm not your wife.What I do, who I'm with
-it's none of your business. If you don't back off,I'll call security."


As if on cue, a security guard approached. "Ms.Gilbert, is everything alright?"


Stella pointed directly at Marc. "I've never seen him in my life. He's unstable and harassing me.I don't want to see him near this complex again."


The guard didn't need more than that. "Yes,ma'am. We'll take care of it."


In this upscale community, the residents were all wealthy or influential, and the security guards were obligated to protect them from harassment.


He signaled, and within seconds, five more guards appeared and closed in on Marc. "Sir,please leave. If you don't, we'll have to call the police."


Marc tried to struggle, yelling as they dragged him off. "You cheating woman! Sleeping around with another man while still married to me! Haley would never do this-she's kind, gentle, and knows how to please me in bed! You? You always did the same boring things-no spark at all!"


Stella didn't flinch. Instead, she smiled coldly and rolled up her window. "Glad to hear you've found

your happily-ever-after, then. Hope you and Haley make lots of little heartbreakers together."


With that, she stepped on the gas, leaving Marc-and all his nonsense-in the dust.


He stood there, mouth open, watching the Ferrari disappear down the road.


She'd really left. Just like that.
