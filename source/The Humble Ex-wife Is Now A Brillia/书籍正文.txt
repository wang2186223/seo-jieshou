
###Chapter 1：A Divorce And A New Start
"Let's end this marriage."
That single sentence was all it took to plunge Christina Jones into a woman unwanted by a wealthy family. Three years of loyalty to her husband, Brendon Dawson, had bought her nothing but heartbreak.
On the day that should have marked a joyful third anniversary, Christina had gone to Brendon's office, eager to invite him out to celebrate. Stepping inside, her eyes fell immediately on an ornate necklace gleaming atop his desk. She had believed the necklace was meant for her.
However, Brendon noticed her stare and snapped the jewelry box shut with a careless hand. "Yolanda's come back. This is her present," he explained, his words sharp and cool, making
sure	there	was	no	room	left for
misunderstanding.
Everything became painfully clear in that
instant. Christina dropped her gaze, thick- rimmed glasses doing little to mask the ache and disappointment swimming in her eyes.
Brendon's old flame,Yolanda Mitchell,had returned and reclaimed her place in his heart. Meanwhile,Christina realized that after three years at Brendon's side, she'd never really belonged there-never held his love, always on the outside, now set aside like something worn out and unnecessary.
Irritation creased Brendon's brow, his patience fraying as he watched Christina stand silently, shoulders slumped. "I'll make sure you're compensated. Let's get this over with and move on. Don't kid yourself into thinking you belong where you never did," he said, his voice cold and final.
Honestly, Brendon had never found fault with Christina's appearance, figure, or way of managing the household. The thing was, she simply bored him. In his eyes, she was flavorless一a meal that left him unsatisfied, easy to set aside. Efficiency in the home didn't make her the woman he longed for.
Christina's silence only deepened the lines in Brendon's forehead. His tone grew cold. "You've got three days to make up your mind.Don't test my patience--I won't wait forever.'
Without a flicker of hesitation,Christina replied,"No need for more time. I'll sign right now." She calmly picked up the pen and wrote her name on the divorce papers.
Together, they went through the motions at court, and soon every legal formality was behind them.
Walking out, Christina felt a heavy ache in her chest, yet a strange sense of freedom crept in as well.
The hope of ever reaching Brendon's heart was gone-she would no longer waste her life in a one-sided relationship. From now on, there'd be no more oscillating between hope and heartbreak, no more self-inflicted wounds from loving a man who couldn't love her back. Lingering pain had felt like dying by a thousand tiny cuts; best to finish it all at once. Now, at last, it was done-irrevocably finished.
A sudden ring from Brendon's phone broke into Christina's reverie. He answered, worry quickly sharpening his features. "What? Yolanda's been hospitalized? I'm on my way!"
With no farewell.Brendon rushed to his car and sped away, never pausing to offer Christina a ride or even a second glance.
Whenever Yolanda was involved. Brendon would abandon everything, swept up in thoughts of her alone.
As soon as Brendon disappeared, a sleek black -and-red Bugatti rolled to a stop right in front of Christina.
Out hopped Davina Morris,Christina's closest friend, sporting a bold outfit and a wide, mischievous grin. "Freedom looks good on you, Christina.Congratulations on finally escaping that mess."
With a flick of her wrist, Davina tossed the keys to Christina, eyes twinkling. "How about something a little crazy tonight?"
Catching the car keys with effortless charm, Christina simply walked over and sat behind the wheel. "Hop in," she said, no hesitation in her voice.
Davina wasted no time in settling into the passenger seat. With a stomp on theaccelerator. Christina left the courthouse-and the past--far behind.
The Bugatti tore down Azure Highway,the engine's roar mixing exhilaration with a sense of release.
"We really ought to hit a bar to celebrate.lf you hadn't held me back, I would've uncorked a bottle and doused that jerk with it right then and there," Davina said, her indignation bubbling over.
"You pick the place. But first, I need a stop at the salon," Christina answered, her calm belying her need for a bit of reckless fun.
Davina shot her a side glance. "Three years off the radar, and people are still searching for you. When are you going to reclaim your crown and turn the medical world upside down again?"
A shrug was all Christina offered. "Haven't made any plans yet," she replied, voice cool and detached.
A sharp, almost mocking laugh slipped from Davina. "Word is, your ex is tearing up the city trying to track the legendary doctor King down, desperate to save his precious sweetheart
Imagine his face if he ever learns you're actually King."
Not a word left Christina's lips. She just stared ahead, her expression unreadable.

......

Meanwhile, Brendon's car raced through traffic, his nerves raw with worry. He dialed his secretary mid-drive. "Still no progress on King's whereabouts?"
King's reputation echoed around the globe, a healer wrapped in legend and secrecy, vanished without a trace for three years. All attempts to locate King had led nowhere. The doctor's true identity remained a puzzle-no one had ever seen King's face, nor even confirmed their gender.
The secretary's voice crackled through the line."We've contacted everyone we know, Mr. Dawson, but King is still missing."
Brendon's brow furrowed. "Don't stop until you find King. I don't care what it takes!"
"We'll keep at it!"
Restlessness gnawed at Brendon as he pulled into the hospital's parking lot and bolted toward the entrance. No matter how high the price, he wouldn't stop searching for King-Yolanda's life depended on it.
###Chapter 2 Raise The Stakes
In the Vertbrook Bar, Christina slíd off her black -rimmed glasses and tucked them into her hands. Without them, her eyes sparkled with mischief and warmth.
Gone was the flat, straight hair she always wore like armor.Now it flowed in waves, framing her face like she belonged on the cover of a magazine. With that red lipstick and confident glow, she turned heads without trying.
She moved like someone who'd shed a skin.Whatever plain, quiet version of herself used to exist at home-she wasn't here tonight.
Davina leaned in, swirling the straw in her cocktail. "Hey, there's a shooting match next week. You thinking of signing up?"
"Not a chance," Christina replied without missing a beat. "It's been forever. My hands aren't as steady as they used to be."
"Come on, who cares?" Davina flashed a teasing grin. "Use it to blow off some steam.Picture Brendon's face on the bullseye and go full demolition mode."
A low chuckle slipped out as Christina brought her glass to her lips. "That's tempting."
"Right?" Davina grinned, her tone rising with excitement."Oh-and guess who's going to be there? Dillan. The guy who almost knocked you out four years ago. You bailed, and now he's been hogging the spotlight ever since."
Davina didn't wait for Christina to respond as she added, "And get this-the prize this year is a custom Bugatti. Not a model you can just go out and buy. One of a kind." She passed her phone to Christina wvithout missing a beat. "Here.Take a look at the competition."
Christina flipped through the details in seconds.The prize money wasn't the only thing catching her attention. What really stood out was the twist-contestants would be hidden behind masks and aliases. But whoever came out on top? They'd get to force the others to show their real faces.
"If you enter and win, you haye to make Dillan take off his mask.I need to know what that guy looks like!" Davina exclaimed.
"Okay." Christina gave her wineglass a gentle swirl. The corners of her mouth curled into a teasing grin. "If I show up, I'm not just going to play. I'm going to raise the stakes."
Davina tilted her head, curiosity sparking in her eyes. "Alright then, tell me-what exactly are you thinking?"
Christina shot Davina a sly grin. "Let everyone know-whoever takes the crown this year gets a personal session with King. No expiry date,either. As long as they meet King's terms, the deal stands."
Davina nearly spilled her drink. "You're kidding!If that gets out, people are going to crawl over each other just to sign up. This thing's about to blow up."
"I'm heading to the restroom." Without another word,Christina rose from her seat.
She didn't make it far before a small crowd of men stepped into her path, their swagger loud enough to silence the room.
"Well, look what we've got here," one of them said, grinning. "You look like you could use
some company. How about a drink?”
They leered at her, scanning her from head to toe like she was something they could own.
Ice filled Christina's gaze. Hervoice dropped like a warning. "Move."
That only seemed to encourage them. "Feisty,"one of them said with a chuckle. "We like a girl who makes things interesting."
Christina didn't flinch. "Last chance. Get out of my way."
Instead of stepping out of her way, one of them whistled,reaching out a hand toward her chest with a lewd grin.
That was all it took. Christina snapped his wrist before his fingers even brushed her. The sickening crunch made the whole group freeze.
The man yelped, "What the hell"
The other men didn't get the chance to retaliate.Christina moved like a storm. A kick to the knee.An elbow to the jaw. One by one, she dropped them with cold precision.
Within moments, the entire group lay sprawled across the floor, groaning and clutching bruises they'd remember for weeks.
Above them, the second floor balcony overlooked the chaos.
"That woman's a knockout," one of Brendon's buddies said, his jaw practically on the floor."Cool,confident-exactly my type."
Brendon's gaze drifted to the woman with the wavy hair, and the longer he stared, the stronger thesense of recognition grew. There was somethingin her face-something uncanny -that made him wonder if he was looking at Christina,his ex-wife.
After spending the afternoon at the hospital with Yolanda,Brendon had agreed to hit the bar on her suggestion. Blowing off steam/ sounded harmless-until now.
"Hold on a second," Yolanda murmured,squinting at the woman downstairs. "Isn't that Christina?"
"Wait, you're telling me that knockout is actually Christina? Get out of here. That can't be the same dull housewife who barely spoke."
Curiosity sparked in the group as they leaned in,squinting for confirmation. Recognition settled in fast-it really was Brendon's ex-wife, and the shock hit them like a slap.
Katie Dawson, Brendon's younger sister, didn't hide her disdain. "Look at her-dressed like she's auditioning for attention. I guess getting dumped made her desperate. Bet she's prowling for a sugar daddy."
The group laughed, quick to follow her lead.
"Typical," someone sneered. "Women like that only know how to latch onto a man."
"Brendon dodged a bullet. With that look? She's practically advertising herself."
"Take the man away and she's got nothing left.Just another gold-digger trying to act like she's someone."
Their voices scratched against Brendon's patience like nails on glass. He/d had enough."Cut it out!" he snapped, his tone sharper than they'd heard all night.
Without waiting fora reply, Brendon gave them one final glare and stormed off in Christina's direction.
###Chapter 3 Her Indifference
"Brendon!"
"Wait,Brendon!"
Katie and Yolanda both called out, their voices overlapping as they rushed to stop Brendon.
Before Brendon could move any farther, they stepped in front of him, forcing him to stop.
"Please tell me you're not about to run to that bitch," Katie said, disbelief tightening her voice.
A flicker of anger crossed Brendon's face."Watch your mouth, Katie. That attitude isn't just rude-it's disgraceful. You're carrying our family name. Try not to drag it through the mud."
Yolanda gently placed a hand on Katie's shoulder, her tone sweet and measured."Brendon, please don't be so harsh on Katie.She's still young and doesn't know better. If you still care about Christina, just be honest with me.I won't make things difficult for you. I'll go quietly."
Yolanda's eyes were red with tears as she made a move to turn away, her face full of hurt.
Seeing her like this made Brendon's heart twist."Yolanda, no-don't go," he said quickly,stepping forward and grabbing her hand."You're misunderstanding. There's nothing left between Christina and me."
"Then be straight with me. Is there still a part of you that loves her? Because... If there is,I can handle it. I won't hold it against you." Yolanda's voice was small and trembling as she met his eyes.
Brendon couldn't ignore the way her face twisted with hurt and hastily said, "You're overthinking it. Whatever Christina does now has nothing to do with me anymore."
Yolanda reached for his hand, her voice gentle but firm as she said, "Perhaps Christina has a reason to dress like that. Maybe she's struggling to fend for herself. We should help her."
Brendon was impressed by Yolanda's apparent kindness. "You've always had a golden heart,Yolanda. But don't fret over Christina. She's not struggling the way you think. I gave her enough
to live comfortably, and if she chooses to be a gold-digger and discards her self-respect,that's on her."
Yolanda seemed like she wanted to say more,but suddenly lost her footing, her body leaning back as her balance faltered.
Brendon moved fast, catching her before she hit the floor. "Yolanda!" His voice cracked with panic.
"L... I'm fine. It's just too noisy here. I feel a bit dizzy. Let's go back to the private room."Yolanda's voice came out faintly as she leaned against him.
Holding her steady, Brendon frowned. "You should've stayed in the hospital and rested a few more days. You shouldn't have insisted on leaving."
Turning toward Katie, he instructed, "Katie, take her back to the private room. I'm going to the restroom and I'll be back in a minute."
Suspicion danced in Katie's eyes like a match to dry paper. "You're not seriously planning to sneak off and meet Christina, are you?"
Before Brendon could respond, Yolanda gently placed her hand on Katie's armn. "It's alright. If Brendon wants to speak to Christina,let him.She's not just some stranger-she was part of his life once. Pretending she doesn't exist won't make her disappear. And if her inappropriate attire tonight stirs up gossip, it won't just fall on Brendon-it could drag down the Dawson name too."
"You're always so thoughtful, Yolanda, even considerate of that bit-" Katie stopped herself just when she caught Brendon's cold stare. She froze,swallowing her next words.
A beat later, Katie's tone shifted. "Brendon,you see, Yolanda's still not in the clear. If something happens while you're out here wasting time,that's on you!"
With an exasperated sigh, Katie latched onto Yolanda's hand. "Come on, Yolanda. We're leaving."
···
Downstairs, Christina exited the restroom.She gave her hair a casual toss, a small gesture that turned every head in the bar. Men watched her openly, eyes trailing her curves with a hunger that didn't even try to hide itself.
From a short distance away,Brendon stood rigid.His jaw tightened as he watched the scene unfold, those men's stares igniting something bitter inside him. They weren't just looking-they were undressing her with their eyes.And he hated it.
"Christina Jones!" Brendon called out, voice low but taut with irritation.
Christina's head turned slowly, her gaze meeting his with a cool detachment. She gave him a slow,deliberate once-over before answering, "What do you want?"
Her tone was casual. Distant. Like he was just another stranger in the crowd.
That chill in her voice struck a nerve. It rattled something in Brendon he wasn't ready to name.
Without thinking, Brendon marched over and seized her wrist. "You're coming with me."
###Chapter 4 At Least I'm Not Delusional
With a swift jerk, Christina yanked her wrist free from Brendon's grasp, eyes narrowed and voice sharp. "Try that again, and you'll regret ever laying a finger on me."
Instead of backing down, Brendon found his irritation boiling over. He couldn't explain it, but it felt like control-something he'd always taken for granted-was slipping through his fingers."This place doesn't suit you!" he snapped, voice cold. "No need to play dress-up just to make me look your way."
That made Christina laugh-sharp, humorless,and laced with contempt. "Wow. You think this is about you? Don't delude yourself.We're finished. Whatever you think you still have a say in,you don't."
"Is that really what you want?" Brendon asked,his stare hard and searching. "To erase everything just likethat?"
"Don't you want the same?" Christina retorted flatly. "Don'tforget, we've already divorced."Brendon's hand twitched, and before he could stop himself, he reached for her again. But her reflexes were faster. With a crisp slap, she knocked his hand away.
"Shit!" Brendon recoiled, holding his wrist, fury flashing in his eyes. "Are you insane?"
"If I am, at least I'm not delusional," Christina said casually, her gaze drifting down tohis groin and back up with a derisive smirk. "Though you might want to get yourself checked for any functional problems."
Rage twisted across his face. "You've got a real mouth on you!"
"Appreciate the compliment," Christina replied with a shrug, completely unfazed.
Brendon's anger flared even hotter. "I came here to warn you because I didn't want to see you crash and burn. But if this is what you want,go ahead.Make your mess. I'm done trying."
Without saying another word, Brendon spun on his heel and stormed off, his frustration echoing in each step. Christina's transformation hadn't
gone unnoticed. Still, in his mind, it was nothing more than a flashy attempt to draw his attention.
Across the room, more than a few men couldn't stop staring, their eyes tracking Christina like prey. She met their gazes with a look so sharp that it could cut glass, and whatever boldness they carried dissolved on the spot. Every spine stiffened. Whatever fantasy they'd been brewing got snuffed out before it even formed.
No one in that bar forgot what had happened earlier. Those foolish enough to touch her were left broken-one of them, quite literally,had his manhood destroyed. Nobody dared try again.Not after witnessing that brutal reminder.
Elsewhere, inside a private, soundproof room tucked away from the crowd, two men silently observed the commotion.
Dylan Scott leaned back in his chair, eyes narrowing slightly as the striking Christina strode away from the scene, her presence drawing focus like gravity. Something about her brought back a name he hadn't spoken aloud in years
Rose. The masked woman who had  nearly shattered his pride at that shooting match four years ago.He could still picture the glint of her eyes behind the mask.
"She's got bite," Ralphy Graham, Dylan's friend,commented, his gaze flicking from the bar to Dylan. "If Brendon picked a fight with her, he'd be eating dirt."
The quiet authority in Dylan's posture was undeniable. He didn't need to speak to make his presence felt-his energy did the work for him.
Ralphy caught the flicker of interest in his friend's eyes and said, "Don't tell me she's cracked that cold wall of yours. You thinking of pursuing her?"
A shift in Dylan's expression sobered the air."Finding any leads on King is all I care about,"he said evenly.
Acrease formedon Ralphy'sbrow."Stillnothing?”
Dylan's features were drawn tight. "Not a trace."
"It's like King disappeared off the face of the earth," Ralphy said, a note of frustration slipping into his voice. "But King is the only one who can treat your sister. That hasn't changed."
At those words, Dylan's grip tightened around his glass. "Exactly. That's why I'll keep looking -no matter how long it takes." Without pause,he downed the entire drink.
A shrill ringsliced through the room, breaking the tension.
Without missing a beat, Ralphy reached for his phone and answered, looking composed at first.But within seconds, that calm shattered. His eyes lit up with sudden, electric excitement, and his posture shot upright.
Dylan raised an eyebrow, voice steady."What could possibly rattle youlike that?"
The call ended with a sharp tap. Ralphy turned to him,breathless with disbelief. "It's about King.The shooting competition!"
Confusion flickered across Dylan's face. "What are you talking about?" He hadn't expected King's name to be tied to a shooting competition.
Ralphy explained, nearly bursting, "King just released a statement. Next week's champion of the shooting competition gets an opportunity for treatment-no expiry, just has to follow King's terms."
Ralphy almost bounced in his seat. The competition he hosted had just become the hottest event of the year because of King's announcement.
"No shit! Seriously?" Dylan leaned forward, his voice dropping, but the edge in it sharp. "Say it again."
With unwavering certainty, Ralphy said,"Whoever wins the shooting competition earns a treatment session from King. And Dylan,you've been on top of the shooting competition for three years straight under the alias of Dillan.If anyone's walking away with that prize, it's going to be you!"
###Chapter 5 Beat Him Once Again
Dylan didn't wait for Ralphy to say another word.He turned sharply and walked away without hesitation.
That sudden exit made Ralphy blink. "Where are you headed?" he called out, still riding the high of the news.
"I'm heading back to train. If I want that win,I can't leave anything to chance," Dylan replied,his voice cold, eyes set like flint on the future.Finally,there was hope-his sister might get the treatment she needed. So long as that phantom from his past-Rose-didn't show up, victory was within reach. Still, he couldn't/afford to gamble on luck. He'd push harder, train longer.Failure wasn't an option.
Elsewhere,Brendon stood frozen/with his phone in hand, staring at the notification of King's statement.
"It's real! King's giving out treatment! You're going to be okay!" Katie gasped from across the room and rushed forward, putting Yolanda into a tight hug.
Uncertainty clouded Yolanda's face. "But... Isn't Dillan still undefeated? I heard no one's even come close to beating him in years."
Katie waved the concern off with a confident smile. "It doesn't matter who wins. We'll make an offer they can't refuse. There's no way anyone will refuse money."
"That's right. Yolanda,you have my word-I'll do everything in my power to get King to treat you,"Brendon said, his voice steady with conviction."No matter what it takes, I'll find a way to ease your pain and make this illness less of a burden."
Tears welled up in Yolanda's eyes as she clutched his sleeve. "You're always doing so much for me. I don't even know how to thank you."
Brendon held her close,one hand soothing her hair. "You don't have to. I'm not doing this for thanks-I'm doing it for you."
Moved beyond words, Yolanda buried her face against his chest. "Brendon, thank you." And so, the long-awaited day of the shooting competition finally arrived.
By morning, the shooting grounds were packed tighter than ever. The rare luxury car was a flashy incentive, but it was King's offer of treatment-more precious than gold or any fancy car-that pulled the crowd in like gravity.
Barely had the opening round finished before contestants began dropping like flies.
As each round grew more demanding, the numbers thinned fast, only the most skilled shooters hanging on.
Brendon held his own long enough to break into the top ten, but his run ended when he pushed too hard for the top five. The disappointment etched itself clearly across his face.
"It's alright, Brendon. We've got more than enough money to work with," Katie said, fully prepared to use their wealth to secure the championship by any means necessary.
Yolanda offered a softer response, her voice warm and gentle. "You did everything you could,Brendon. Making it that far was amazing. Please don't be so hard on yourself."
One look at Yolanda's calm, supportive smile eased some of the tension knotted in Brendon's chest. Even so, her grace only deepened the self-reproach for not being skilled enough to win the prize of King's treatment twisting inside him. He hated coming up short.
Now, only two names remained on the board.One man.One woman.
Everyone recognized Dillan-the reigning champ with a perfect track record. The woman standing across from himn, Chrissy, was a mystery to most.
The final challenge came with a twist-contestants had to shoot while blindfolded.
Dylan had already pieced it together. Chrissy wasn't some unknown competitor. She was Rose-the same Rose who had/disappeared without a trace three years ago. She hadn't just returned. She had reinvented herself under a brand-new alias.
Standing across from the very woman who had once crushed him in the past, Dylan felt the weight of that memory press down hard.Even so,three years of relentless training had reshaped him. This time, he believed he could take her down.
With steady steps,Dylan walked onto the stage.A black mask concealed his face, but the resolve in his stance said everything.
The staff tied the blindfold tightly, and the final showdown began.
First shot-direct hit. Right through the center.
Second shot-another bullseye.
Then came the third.
All around him, the crowd leaned in, the arena holding its breath like one giant lung.
When that final shot struck dead center, the silence shattered into wild cheers. The audience leapt from their seats, the roar deafening.
"Dillan is amazing! If I flirt with him and win him over, I bet I can talk him into giving up that prize once he wins!" Katie exclaimed from the front row, clapping her hands together and beaming.
"You're smitten with him, aren't you?" Yolanda tilted her head, an amused sparkle in her eyes.
Flushing, Katie quickly waved it off. "Absolutely not! I'm just trying to secure King's treatment for you,that's all."
Yolanda chuckled. "You've always looked out for me, Katie. I'm so lucky to have you."
Brendon crossed his arms. "This match is Dillan's to take. No question."
Brendon hadn't taken Chrissy seriously since she walked in. In his mind, women just didn't belong in the upper tier of this sport. The name Rose still lingered in his memory-her win years ago felt more like a lucky strike than a real triumph.If she had the skill, she wouldn't have vanished three years ago.
Now blindfolded and standing center stage,Chrissy-who was actually Christina-made no move to shoot. Instead,she turned her body slowly,letting the eyes of the crowd follow her every motion.
Whispers broke out almost immediately. "Is she giving up?"
"Maybe this is her way of backing out without saying it outright."
"I said it from the start-women just can't hold their own in a match like this."
But as the noise grew louder, Christina raised her weapon behind her back and, without adjusting her stance, pulled the trigger. The shot rang out sharp and clean.
"Direct hit!" the announcer shouted.
Gasps rippled through the audience. She had landed a bullseye-and under conditions that were harder than earlier rounds.
"How is that possible?"
"No way. That was pure luck!"
While the crowd clung to doubt, Dylan's confidence began to slip. It was happening again. He was about to lose to Rose.
From her second shot to her last, Christina never missed. Each movement was fluid, each shot dead-on. She moved like she had eyes in the back of her head. Shot after shot, bullseye after bullseye.
The difficulty of Chrissy's round surpassed
Dylan's, leaving no room for dispute-Chrissy had won. Cheers erupted, curses followed,and stunned silence filled the gaps in between.
Those who bet everything on Dillan were left stunned and broke.Meanwhile, Davina couldn't stop grinning. She had bet on Chrissy from the start-and now she was walking away with more money than she knew what to do with.
Dylan remained rooted to the spot, his disbelief anchoring him in place as Christina strode straight toward him.
"You will peel off the mask yourself, or should I do it for you?" Christina said casually,determined to see his face as per the privilege that came with the winner.
The voice modulator built into her mask disguised her tone, keeping the crowd guessing.
But Dylan didn't need a voice to recognize her -he knew. This was Rose. No doubt. With no hesitation, he reached up and/pulled off his mask.
Gasps swept through the arena as his face came into full view. Revealed beneath the mask was none other than Dylan Scott, head of the city's
most powerful dynasty and the silent  force behind the very competition they were watching.
Brendon exhaled in quiet relief. Had Dylan come out on top, not even the Dawson name would've held any weight to sway him into giving up the prize of King's treatment.Compared to Dylan's influence, the Dawson family would've been brushed aside like a rumor.
Masked and silent, Christina moved past Brendon and his crew, her steps aimed at Davina -until Katie suddenly stepped in her way.
"Hold it right there!" Katie planted herself in front of Christina, eyes narrowed with smug defiance."That reward-sell it to us. Just say how much you want."
"Nah, not for sale," Christina said,her voice dry and unmoved. Helping Yolanda had never been on her agenda. Not now. Not ever.
"You seriously think refusing us is smart?" Katie snapped. "Do you know what happens to people who go against the Dawson family?"
"I don't," Christina said with a shrug. "And I don't care. I said it's not forsale."
"You arrogant-" Katie's words failed her as rage took over. In one furious motion, she lunged forward and yanked the mask off Christina's face.
Every head turned. Silence swept the crowd as Christina's face was revealed to all.
###Chapter 6 Ex-husband's Offer
As the white mask was torn away, Christina's breathtaking face was revealed. Graceful features framed her face-so striking that it was impossible not to stare. The contradictory qualities of allure and innocence coexisted on her face without the slightest discord, blending seamlessly into a unique charm that no one could replicate. She exuded an enchanting glow.
"Christina?" Brendon stood rooted to the spot,his brain struggling to process this unexpected revelation.
Katie's jaw dropped as her eyes locked on Christina,disbelief washing over her like a slap.The idea that Christina-of all people-had just won the shooting match felt absurd.
Neither Katie nor Brendon could reconcile with the fact that the woman who once folded laundry and made grocery lists had just emerged victorious in the shooting competition. How could a woman, cast aside and overlooked for the past three years, pull off breathtakingly
difficult blind shots with that kind of precision and grace?
Finally finding her voice, Katie scowled and stepped forward. "What the hell are you doing here,Christina?"
Christina didn't flinch. Her smile was razor-sharp,her expression unreadable. "I could ask you the same thing. And why wouldn't I be here?"
Brendon retorted, his voice sharp and loud,"This isn't a place for someone like you. You're not cut out for this!"
"Oh?" Christina cocked her head, her smile now dripping with mockery. "Where I choose to be is none of your concern. And since when do pathetic people like you get to decide what I'm allowed to do?"
"You bitch!" Katie, burning with fury, lunged forward with her hand raised, ready to strike Christina across the face.
Without even blinking, Christina caught Katie's wrist mid-air. Her grip was steady. Unflinching.Cold
Katie gasped as pressure clamped down on her bones. "Ah!" she cried out, her voice cracking in pain. She was mildly surprised. That grip wasn't normal. That strength didn't belong to the fragile woman they thought they knew.
"Christina Jones!" Brendon charged forward, his face dark with fury as he seized Christina's wrist."Let go of Katie. Now," he said through clenched teeth.
Moments like this had played out before countless times. Every time things got ugly between Christina and his family, Brendon chose his blood over her without hesitation.
Christina gave him a sharp look and a mocking smile before her fingers loosened. Katie stumbled back, cradling her wrist.
Christina didn't release Katie because of Brendon. The truth was, she had no desire to engage with them.
Even after Christina let go, Brendon refused to release her. His grip stayed firm, as if trying to stake some last claim. "Let go of me," Christina said, her voice low and sharp, her patience thinning.
"Sell me the King's treatment opportunity. I'll pay whatever it takes" Instead of backing off,Brendon tightened his hold
Christina met his gaze with a sneer, her eyes brimming with contempt. "Anything lask for?"
"Anything," Brendon said without hesitation "Just don't ask for my heart or the position of my wife
In Brendon's mind, Christina was shallow enough to jump at the right offer Money, he assumed,was all it would take He saw no difference between his offer and the choice she'd made when she supposedly hit the bar for a sugar daddy the other night
Christina's eyes locked onto his. They were sharp. Unforgiving. "Then give me your life in return."
The demand hit him hard. His expression darkened, and for a moment, he was completely thrown. His life?
"Don't push it, Christina Jones!" Katie snapped,her voice shrill with fury.
Yolanda's brows pulled together as she spoke up, her voice weak, much like most expected
from a patient. "Christina, I know you can't stand me since Brendon chose me over you and never loved you If you're angry, aim it at me Brendon doesn't deserve your bitterness All he ever wanted was to marry me, the woman he truly loves-is that so unforgivable? If you still want to be with him, I won't stand in your way I'll step back But if I do, Brendon will be heartbroken Can you really bear to see him live the rest of his life in pain?
Christina turned her gaze to Yolanda, noticing the shimmer of unshed tears clinging to the edges of her eyes. Yolanda's performance was hard to stomach.
Christina had to admit Yolanda was a master of manipulative tricks, each word dripped with apparent concern for Brendon and blatant accusations of her being selfish and unreasonable, thus painting herself as an angel with a golden heart.
A glint of light caught Christina's eye-Yolanda's necklace, a cruel reminder of her own past naivety. Back at the third anniversary of their marriage, she had believed that the necklace was a heartfeIt gesture from Brendon.She'd deluded herself that maybe, just maybe,he had finally warmed up to her
But the truth hadn't just hurt It had wrecked her His harsh words-a gift specially prepared for Yolanda's return-had shattered the last illusion she clung to She'd learned the hard way that love forced into existence only left scars behind.Some things, no matter how tightly held, simply weren't meant to be
###Chapter 7 You Actually Hit M e
Katie's voice rose with righteous indignation."Yolanda, you and Brendon are madly in love. If it weren't for Christina's interfering, you two would have already married and had kids by now!How could you consider stepping aside for her to bond with Brendon?"
Christina's eyes narrowed. Her voice dripped with disdain. "I interfered? Funny. Who was it that ran off the moment Brendon ended up in a wheelchair?"
Christina scoffed at Katie's audacity in uttering those words. Brendon would've been paralyzed for life if she hadn't stepped in and used her medical skills to heal him. With the exception of Bethel Dawson, Brendon's grandmother, the entire Dawson family had shown nothing but contempt and thanklessness. Had Bethel not once saved her life, she wouldn't have tolerated even a second of their arrogance.
Yolanda's confidence cracked. Her hands trembled slightly before she pulled herself
together and slipped back into her usual act,tears glistening in her eyes. "It wasn't like that,Christina. My grandfather has forced me to leave. I had no sayin it.."
A short, sharp laugh slipped past Christina's lips."Spare me."
Sadly, no one else seemed to see through Yolanda's act,and the Dawson family swallowed her every word like it was gospel.
"What's so funny?" Katie shot Christina a sharp glare, her voice laced with fury. "If my grandmother hadn't foolishly insisted that Brendon marry you, do you really think someone like you would ever stand a chance of joining my family? Keep dreaming!"
"I'm laughing because you're all hopelessly stupid." Christina didn't mince her words as her smirk widened.
That was enough to send Katie over the edge.She lifted her hand and intended to slap Christina.
Smack! Christina moved first.The sound of the slap echoed before anyone registered what was going on.
Katie reeled back, her eyes widening, fury and disbelief swirling together. "You... You actually hit me?"
"Couldn't stop myself," Christina said, casting a mock-inspecting glance at her hand. "Though I think your face might've bruised my palm." She blew on her palm, a faint smile curling at the corners of her mouth.
"You!" Outrage flared in Katie's eyes. She lurched forward, fists clenched, ready to strike again.
"That's enough!" Brendon's voice boomed,cutting through the chaos like a blade.
"Brendon!" Katie snapped, stomping her foot like a child denied her way. "You're really going to side with that slut? She slapped me!"
Brendon shot her a glare. "Anyway, she's your formersister-in-law.Show some basic decency."
"I wouldn't show her any shred of politeness, no matter what!" Katie retorted, her voice thick with resentment.
Brendon's jaw tightened, but his voice softened as he turned to Christina, his hand still on her
wrist. "Katie's just immature. Don't take her words seriously."
"Take your hand off me. I don't want to deal with you guys-I'm starving," Christina said,her voice sharp and cool.
Her frigid tone caught him off guard. It stung in a way he didn't expect. "You really have to talk to me like this?" he asked, frowning asif he couldn't understand.
Christina rolled her eyes and sneered,"I don't want to drag on this pointless conversation with you. Now let go."
"Let's strike a deal," Brendon said quickly,desperation leaking into his voice. "Sell me the prize of King's treatment. I'm asking you-just think back to the lovely three years we spent married."
Christina rolled her eyes. Yeah, as if they had any pleasant memories in the past three years.She silently marveled at	the sheer shamelessness embedded in every branch of the Dawson bloodline. "No deal," she declared firmly.
"For Christ's sake, couldn't you stop being this stubborn, Christina? Are you doing this just to get back at me? If the position of my wife is all you're after, fine-you can have it again.Satisfied?" Brendon's tone dipped into arrogant pity.
Christina's voice rose, her anger barely contained. "Are your ears not functioning or what? I said no deal! And the position of your wife? I couldn't care less who takes it. It means absolutely nothing to me!"
She was so livid that she nearly let out a laugh.Just how could he see himself as the best thing since sliced bread, as if being his wife was an honor that most pursued?
"Christina, I know you didn't mean your words and that you're upset. I can remarry you, but you need to give me the prize of King's treatment," Brendon said, his voice steeped in exasperation as if he had been tolerating Christina's supposed tantrum.
Christina stared at him for a moment that stretched too long, her expression thoughtful.How had she missed that he was this infuriatingly arrogant and shameless? Proposing to remarry her as a bargaining chip to snatch King's treatment-did he actually believe he  was some kind of grand prize and women should be lining up to charm him?
"Have you lost your fucking mind? Why would anyone in their right mind want to marry you again?" Christina snapped, her patience gone.
Before the last word had even settled in the air,she grabbed Brendon's wrist and twisted hard without hesitation.
###Chapter 8 The Loser Puts Their Hand On The Line
Christina moved like lightning. In one seamless motion, she flipped Brendon over her shoulder and slammed him into the pavement. He hit the ground before he even had time to react.
Everyone around them froze. Nobody could believe what theyhad just seen.
Lying on his back, Brendon groaned through clenched teeth. His face contorted, and the pain was written all over him.
"Brendon!" Katie and Yolanda rushed to his side.They dropped to their knees, panic in their eyes,wvatching him struggle just to sit up.
By the time Brendon was back on his feet,wincing with every movement, Christina had already started walking away.
"What are you doing just standing there? Go after her! Aren't you all Brendon's friends?"Katie yelled, her voice sharp with fury as she spun around,pointing furiously at the group of idle men.
The men who had been frozen in place just moments ago suddenly jolted into motion. None of them was bold enough to face Christina on their own. But as a group,they figured they had the upper hand.
Christina didn't flinch. She tilted her head from side to side, loosening her neck, calm as ever while they closed in.
Just before she could make a move, someone charged in from the edge of the crowd. It was Dylan.
The man at the front barely had time to register Dylan. Dylan's foot struck his chest and sent him flying across the ground like a ragdoll.
"Ah!" One by one, the rest of them went down.Screams of pain filled the air as Dylan moved through them with brutal precision. None of them got back up.
A sudden presence shifted the air as Ralphy strode in, flanked by a squad of imposing bodyguards who filled the room with silent threat.
"You think you can stir up chaos in my shooting range and walk away? You've got a death wish!"Ralphy snapped, his voice booming.
With a flick of his hand, Ralphy turned to the bodyguards. "Get rid of them. They're banned for life."
"Understood." The bodyguards didn't hesitate.Without a word, they grabbed the troublemakers and dragged themout.
Katie, who had been yelling just minutes ago,shrank back, visibly shaken and pale.
Yolanda's frustration boiled over. Her voice quivered with a measured pout as she turned toward Dylan. "Mr. Scott, this wasn't our fault.Don't you think this punishment is too harsh?"
"Exactly! Christina started all of it!" Katie exclaimed, finding her voice and stabbing her finger in Christina's direction.
Dylan's eyes narrowed into a steely glare. His words came slow and sharp."Are you giving me instructions now?"
That single question dropped like a hammer.The icy weight of his stare made both women freeze.
"N-no, I didn't mean it like that..." Katie's voice faltered as she instinctively stepped back.
Right beside Katie, Yolanda grabbed Katie's hand and gave her a meaningful look. That glance wasn't just for comfort. She was urging Katie to act-this was a rare chance to make a move on Dylan. Seeing Dylan up close was something most could only dream of-yet here he stood, mere steps away. If Katie desired to become Dylan's wife, she needed to act fast and own the moment.
Katie grasped the stakes in an instant and pushed herself to move forward. She pointed at Christina. "Mr. Scott, a woman like her couldn't have won against you fair and square. She must've pulled something sneaky. You really ought to look into it properly!"
She was playing to his vanity, betting that his ego could be her greatest ally. No/man wanted to admit defeat, especially not/to a woman.Dylan was not someone to cross-and if Christina had ticked him off, her whole future could've gone up in smoke.
Murmurs began to ripple through the crowd.Those who had bet money on Dylan emerging as victorious in the shooting competition wwere the loudest, their voices turning bitter with their financial loss.
"I'm with you on this! That new girl, Chrissy, had to have done something shady. There's just no chance she beat Mr. Scott, the champion for three years straight,without cheating somehow."
"Same mind here. Somebody needs to check her out. Women don't win these things unless something fishy's going on."
"Come on. Everyone knows guys have the edge in this sport. She must've cheated, no question."
Christina let out a dry laugh, clearly fed up with the baseless accusations being thrown at her."I had my back to the target the whole time.So tell me, how would I have managed to cheat?What,do you think I smuggled in someone else to shoot for me? The truth is, you guys just can't handle losing to a woman.Fine then-how about this? Let's settle it with a match right now.The loser puts their hand on the line!"
The last sentence hit hard. A cold silence spread as the boldest voices suddenly quieted down.Feet shuffled. No one dared to speak.
With a look of pure disdain, Christina scanned their faces. "All bark and no bite," she said. "You guys love to talk until it's time to prove something."
"You're a cheat! How can you even prove it was you out there on the range?" Katie interjected without missing a beat, her voice steady and laced with suspicion. "You showed up in that white mask and walked through a blind spot where no one was watching. For all we know,you could've switchedplaceswithsomeoneelse."
###Chapter 9 She Is Actually Rose
Christina regarded Katie with a look bordering on contempt, as though observing a fool parade their ignorance. She couldn't imagine how Katie's mind could come up with such an absurd accusation. Did Katie seriously believe the organizers of the shooting range were mere decoration?
"Are you implying our range operates unfairly?"Ralphy asked, the corner of his mouth lifting subtly as his penetrating gaze settled on Katie.Although his voice was friendly, there was something dangerously sharp lurking behind his eyes, causing Katie's pulse to quicken anxiously.
"No-no, that's not what I meant!" Katie stuttered, frantically waving her hands as she struggled to clarify."It's just/that I know Christina far too well. Shooting isn't in her skill set. She's just a regular housewife."
Ralphy's eyebrows	rose	slightly.	"Are housewives somehow incapable of handling a firearm?"
"Anyway, she's all about household chores-don't let her fool you!" Katie insisted, her desperation mounting with every word.
Dylan's expression hardened noticeably. "Not only can she shoot, she's extraordinary."
"I am pretty sure she somehow had cheated! Mr.Scott, you've got to listen to me! You can't trust a word that woman says-she's nothing but a fraud! She doesn't even deserve to stand on the same shooting field as you. And her supposed beating you? Don't be ridiculous!"Katie snapped.
A cold glint sharpened in Dylan's eyes as he shot daggers at her. "If she's unworthy, where exactly does that leave you? Perhaps reflect on your own worthiness before passing judgment."
"You're bewitched by her looks-completely!There's much more to her than meets the eye!"Katie hissed, frustration pushing/tears to the corners of her eyes.
Slowly,Dylan scanned the faces of the spectators, noting their mix of shock and stubborn skepticism. He himself had accepted defeat by Christina gracefully, yet these lesser
competitors still dared to challenge her credibility.
With a quiet grin, Dylan revealed the truth that changed everything. "She's Rose-the very Rose who defeated me four years ago."
A hush enveloped the space instantly, every head pivoting toward Christina.
"That can't be right! She can't be Rose!" Katie's voice cracked under the weight of disbelief.
Excited chatter surged through the room,each voice alive with theories about the enigmatic Rose and her remarkable abilities.
"If she truly is Rose, defeating Dylan isn't beyond her capabilities."
"But didn't she debut as Chrissy? Why would she need a new alias if she was already a legend?"
"You're kidding! Rose is this stunning? No one's seen her in three years since she took Dylan down, and now she's returned to finish what she started. Her skill level is legendary!"
Brendon remained rooted in place, eyes wide with disbelief as he studied Christina. Her tranquil	expression,untouched by the commotion, radiated an unsettling confidence.He blinked. Was this really his former wife?Christina-the dull, ordinary woman he'd divorced-was actually Rose? The one he once dismissed as plain was actually extraordinary and intimidating.This Christina felt unfamiliar,utterly beyond his recognition.
Brendon struggled to bridge the gap between the Christina he remembered and the poised woman standing confidently before him. How many layers had she hidden beneath her facade?They'd shared three years of marriage, yet he suddenly realized he didn't quite know her. Her secretiveness now gnawed at him, resentment simmering within.
"She can't be Rose! She's just a useless housewife!" Katie shouted, her voice frantic and shaking with fury.
Calm and poised, Christina turned her unwavering gaze on Katie. "Like I've said-if anyone doubts my identity, they're welcome to challenge me. But be warned-the stakes are a hand."
Every eye turned sympathetically toward Katie,recognizing her imminent defeat, Challenging
Christina was like courting disaster. Luck might grant one victory, but consistent wins meant undeniable talent.
"Fine," Katie said reluctantly, forcing herself forward with hesitant steps.
###Chapter 10 Chicken Out
"Katie!" Brendon cut her off in a panic, his hands clammy as dread crept up his spine. As much as he hated to believe it, the possibility that Christina was truly Rose gnawed at him.And if that were true, then Katie stepping up to challenge her would be nothing short of walking into disaster. With Dylan overseeing the match,any thought of bending the rules was pure fantasy.
Standing beside Brendon, Yolanda's lips tightened in disappointment-she'd been counting on this clash to drive an irreparable wedge between Christina and the Dawson family. But Brendon's intervention had pulled the brakes before things spiraled too far.
Katie flinched at Brendon's shout, and as calm slowly descended upon her, the bravado drained from her face,replaced by a cold wash of dread.Her aim was mediocre at best, and even if Christina wasn't Rose, the odds were stacked against her. Losing wouldn't just bruise her ego -it would come with brutal consequences-losing one of her hands.
"Well, if everyone's done making a scene,T'll be heading out for dinner," Christina said casually,as if nothing of significance had just unfolded.
Tradition held that the top ten shooters would be treated to dine at the Morfort Restaurant,with family members and friends allowed to tag along.
Christina recalled that Davina had raved about trying the Morfort Restaurant's signature dishes -she decided it was the perfect time to indulge together.
With no further objections, Christina shifted her attention to Dylan. "Thanks for stepping in earlier, Mr. Scott. Until next time."
Without waiting for a reply, she pivoted and walked off, her confidence leaving a silent echo in the space.
Bitterness burned in Katie's eyes as she watched Christina disappear into the crowd. Her stomach twisted tighter when Dylan glanced after Christina,feeding the green monster of jealousy raging inside her.
In Katie's mind, Christina wasn't talented-she was just manipulative, skilled only in wrapping men around her finger.
Unable to contain her fury, Katie began scheming, her thoughts spinning like storm clouds gathering. Feigning clumsiness, she moved toward Dylan, letting herself stumble dramatically in his direction.
Just before impact, Dylan caught the motion and turned, his expression sharpening in annoyance. With instinctive grace, he stepped aside, avoiding her like a raindrop dodged on reflex.
Katie hadn't counted on that. She hit the floor hard,her balance vanishing along with her pride."Ahh!" she cried out, the pain twisting her features in an exaggerated grimace.
Yolanda rushed forward, alarmed. "Katie!" she screamed,quickly crouching to lift Katie up.
Katie hissed as she rose, her face contorted,teeth clenched against the sting. Crimson streaks marred her arm, blood trickling from fresh scrapes.
"Mr. Scott, was there really nothing you could've done to stop Katie from falling?"
Yolanda's voice carried a hint of reproach.
But Dylan's eyes turned ice-cold, and without a word,he turned his back and sauntered away.
Ralphy couldn't hold back a derisive chuckle."Consider yourself lucky. The last woman who tried something with Dylan didn't walk away unscathed."
Ralphy scoffed. As if no one could see through these shallow, tired games? Please-transparency had never looked more obvious.Scheming against Dylan had always been a dangerous gamble-those who tried rarely escaped unscathed.
Choosing not to waste another breath on them,Ralphy pivoted and strode after Dylan, each step exuding purpose.
Ralphy's mind shifted to Christina. Compared to the theatrics of Yolanda and Katie, she was a refreshing presence-and remarkably skilled at shooting.
Now, with the prize of King's treatment,Christina held something every major family desperately wanted. The elite were already circling, eager to negotiate and willing to pay dearly to claim the treatment opportunity:Should she decide to put it up for sale, her status would skyrocket, securing her a seat at the most exclusive tables. Right now, she was a highly sought-after figure.
But the real question lingered:who among them had the power or leverage to secure the treatment opportunity from Christina?
Ralphy, of course, hoped Dylan would be the one to succeed-but what would Christina ask in return? The possibilities stirred a mix of anticipation and curiosity within him.
Meanwhile, back in the hallway, Katie clenched her jaw to suppress a cry, the pain from her injuries forcing her to turn to Brendon with desperation. "Brendon, what now?" she asked,voice brittle. "Christina hates you too much to ever give us that treatment."
Tears welled in Yolanda's eyes as she looked up at Brendon, her voice catching with measured sorrow."Maybe it's time to let go. I don't care how long I have left-as long as I can spend it with you, that's enough for me."
Brendon felt his chest tighten with her words.He gripped her hand. "You'll be alright, Yolanda.
I swear I'll find a way to make Christina give it to us willingly."
Tears glimmered as Yolanda's voice trembled with curiosity. "But how? What could possibly change her mind?"
###Chapter 11 Never Fall For Her
Yolanda's red-rimmed eyes and trembling voice were enough to tighten Brendon's heart. To him,she embodied everything virtuous-selfless,nurturing, and impossibly kind-qualities that Christina never once showed him.
Brendon's thumb traced slow circles across the back of Yolanda's hand, cherishing the delicate warmth of her skin. "You'll know by then," he murmured, pulling her into a firm embrace."Yolanda, nothing will ever happen to you as long as I'm here." 3
Touched by his words, Yolanda buried her face in his chest, her whisper unsteady as if she truly regretted her abrupt leave back then. "Brendon,I'll never leave your side or break your heart again. I'm sorry for leaving you three years ago.It was my grandfather... He threatened me with his life. I had no choice but to leave the country back then. Brendon. I didn't know what else to do..."
Yolanda added,tears glimmering in her eyes, a calculated act of innocence, "But-tell me the truth...Have you truly forgiven me? Or is this just about hurting Christina?"
Brendon froze at the question, the image of Christina's cold, dismissive face flashing in his mind,the humiliation still clinging to him.
His expression darkened. "She isn't worth that kind of effort," he said, voice sharp with disdain."I know you were trapped, Yolanda. I've never blamed you-not for a second. From now on,nothing will come between us again."
Yolanda's heart swelled at the vehemence in his voice. His loathing for Christina felt like a gift.So, Christina truly had no charm at all. Despite her years of efforts to win Brendon's affection,she could not earn a sliver of his heart.
Yolanda smirked, drawing pleasure from the conclusion that Christina held less charm than her. Despite the time and distance, all she had to do was return, let a single tear/fall, brush her hand against Brendon's-and he was hers again,completely. 2
Katie sneered, her tone dripping with disdain,"Yolanda, someone like Christina doesn't even deserve to breathe the same air as you."
Putting on an air of gentle modesty, Yolanda gave Katie a slight frown. "Katie, let's not speak ill of her. While I was away, she did stay by Brendon's side to care for him. For that, I'm thankful."
Frustration flickered across Katie's face as she retorted, "Yolanda! You're way too kind,too forgiving. Keep acting like this, and one day someone might snatch Brendon right out from under you!"
"That's never going to happen," Brendon interjected, his brows furrowing. "I belong to Yolanda. That won't change."
"Brendon, you're really telling me you never felt anything for Christina? Not even a little?"Katie asked, raising an eyebrow. Her/intuition told her that there was something subtly different in the way he looked at Christina.
"Nothing at all," Brendon said, his tone sharp and certain. "Christina means nothing to me and never will."
Turning his gaze to Yolanda, his eyes softened with affection. "There's only one woman l've ever loved-and she's right here in front of me."
A wave of emotion overcame Yolanda, and she clung to him tightly, tears spilling as she whispered, "Brendon..."
Katie, watching the tender moment unfold,exhaled slowly, a sense of reassurance washing over her. Maybe she'd misread things. Their connection was unshakable-no outsider could ever come between them. She had always viewed Brendon and Yolanda's love as something rare, like it belonged in storybooks.Christina could plot all she wanted,but it would never change a thing. Brendon's heart would never belong to her, and there wasn't a chance she could ever steal him from Yolanda.
Breaking the brief silence, Katie asked brightly,"Should we head to the Morfort Restaurantnow?"
Brendon didn't mniss a beat. He remembered Christina had been there, and with no sign of hesitation, he said, "Let's go."
Soon, the three of them reached Morfort Restaurant. But by the time they got there,they'd already missed the better seating, and Brendon's ranking in the competition wasn't quite enough to secure a prime spot. So, they ended up at a table farther off, while Christina sat up front at the first table.
###Chapter 12 The Manager
Christina sat beside Davina, her laughter spilling out like a bell, light and easy. She wore confidence like a second skin, and the soft charm in her smile only added to her grace.Already named the winner, she seemed to shine even brighter, effortlessly pulling eyes toward her.




Katie couldn't help but see how the spotlight had shifted to Christina. A few of the men were even eyeing Christina with something close to admiration, maybe even respect, and that only stirred her jealousy even more. How did someone like Christina-just an unwanted woman-end up stealing the spotlight?



Rather than acknowledge Christina's talents,Katie clung to the idea that there had to be something shady going on behind the scenes. In her mind, Christina didn't win on skill and had clearly made some backdoor deal with the shooting range staff.



"I've gotta admit, I didn't expect Christina to pull that off," Yolanda commented, her tone
beat Mr. Scott. She's kind of the star right now isn't she?"


Though the words came wrapped in admiration,Yolanda's glance flicked toward Katie, a spark of mischief behind her eyes.


And just as Yolanda had expected, Katie snapped, the bitterness sharp in her voice, "Oh,come on! Who knows what kind of strings she pulled to come out on top? A plain nobody like her beating a reigning champ? That doesn't add up. Bet she slept her way to the championship with the organizers."


Brendon shifted in his seat, his expression clouding.Her words made it sound like he was cuckolded.


"That's a bit much," Yolanda said under her breath, her words calculated to fan the flame while appearing to defend Christina. "Christina doesn't really seem like that type."

Katie let out a laugh that held no humor. "Don't be fooled. The second she signed those divorce papers,she started parading around like she was auditioning for attention. Skirts shorter. Makeup bolder. She's desperate, and everyone knows it _"



Before Katie could spit out more venom,Brendon interjected, "That's enough. Eat." His
tone left no room for argument.

"What? I'm just telling the truth. Why are you snapping at me like I said something out of line?"Katie retorted, shooting him a glare.

Seeing another chance to make her seem nice,Yolanda reached out and lightly touched Brendon's sleeve, her voice low and calm as she said, "Brendon, go easy on Katie, will you? She's still young. She blurts things out without thinking. She's not trying to hurt anyone."


"You're always making excuses for her. That's exactly why she keeps pushing the line," he said,letting out a quiet sigh, the edge in his voice dulled significantly.

Just then, the manager of the Morfort Restaurant stepped into view, commanding instant attention like a ripple through still water.

Legends swirled around the establishment's enigmatic owner-a figure whose reach extended far beyond the polished/walls of the restaurant.


Years ago, a haughty noble family had tried to undermine the Morfort Restaukant's business,mocking its prestige. Predictably, their arrogance was short-lived. Not long after their audacious actions against the Morfort Restaurant, the family's fortune had crumbled
their reputation shredded beyond repair A family accustomed to a life of luxury and privilege had failed to handle the downfall-some of them had either committed suicide or gone mad. Those who clung to survival did so on the edge of society-begging, scavenging,shadows of their former selves.



The Morfort Restaurant's owner's identity remained cloaked in secrecy, but everyone knew that the power behind it was not to betrifled with. No one was foolish enough to mess with even the servers, much less the manager. To the guests, the manager wasn't just a restaurant employee. It was like seeing the trusted envoy of a king.



With elegance in his step and a courteous smile,the manager scanned the hall before proceeding with silent authority.



"| think he's coming over here," Yolanda whispered, barely able to contain her anticipation.
Katie was even more thrilled, her eyes fixed on the smiling manager. Could it be that the mysterious owner of the Morfort Restaurant had taken notice of her? And if that were true,mavbe the owner was even on par with Dylan
-or at least close.




Katie was sitting straighter, shoulders back, lips slightly parted. She was ready for the spotlight to find her.
###Chapter 13 Katie Made Herself A Fool
Whispers rippled across the room like wind through tall grass.



"Do you think the manager came for Katie Dawson?"



"Has to be. He wouldn't be this serious unless something major was going down."



"Maybe the owner of the Morfort Restaurant has taken an interest in her."



"If that's true, the Dawsons just struck gold.Their status would shoot through the roof-and they'd probably take a few people with them."



"Honestly, Katie's got some serious luck on her side."



Wrapped in the glow of attention, Katie looked like she was walking on air.



One by one, heads turned toward Katie's table,curiosity building like pressure behind a dam.
With a hint of bashfulness in her eyes, Katie rose to her feet and offered a modest smile,getting ready to meet the manager.



Everything about her posture said she expected the manager's approach to end right at her side.Instead, he glided past her without a second glance. For a full second, she stood frozen, her grin faltering mid-expression.



The humiliation hit her like a slap. Her hands twitched, and she struggled not to shrink into her chair. By now, the quiet had turned into silent amusement. The entire room knew exactly what had just happened.



"Didn't you say you needed the bathroom? I'll come with you," Yolanda said, leaning in to break the tension.



Thankful for the intervention, Katie forced a smile and quickly said, "Yes, let's go."



Yolanda stood up. Just as the two were turning to leave, they froze mid-step when the manager suddenly stopped-right in front of Christina's table, beaming. Their heads slowly turned, eyes fixed on Christina like she had just grown wings.
"Miss Jones, my employer would be honored if you and your friend would join him for a private meal on the top floor," the manager said with a slight bow and a polished tone.



The Morfort Restaurant's top floor wasn't meant for regular patrons. It was practically sacred ground. No one entered without an invitation, and most folks never even saw the staircase leading there.



A wave of envy swept across the room as everyone's attention snapped to Christina. Did she actually know the elusive owner of the Morfort Restaurant?
Brendon's grip on his wine glass tightened, his expression clouded over.



"When did Christina get acquainted with the owner of Morfort Restaurant? Was it during the shooting competition or could it be..." Yolanda deliberately trailed off, leaving her implication hanging in the air.
Katie sneered,bitterness seeping into her smile,"I told you before-she's always had a way of getting what she wants with her tricks. Now you see her knack for snaring men!"
"Or maybe we're reading too much into it.Could just be coincidence," Yolanda said purposely, casting Brendon a side glance to gauge his reaction.



"I don't see what kind of coincidence you think there is. If she actually had any talent, there was no way she could tolerate being stuck doing nothing but housework every single day in the past three years. She'd have gone out and made something of herself. But no-she's spent all those years living off the Dawsons without a single thing to show for it," Katie replied, her voice sharp with resentment.



Katie's blood boiled at the thought of Christina rubbing elbows with the elusive owner of the Morfort Restaurant. Rage twisted her face as she said through clenched teeth, "She really knows how to throw herself at powerful men."




"Weren't you both headed to the restroom?Don't linger," Brendon chimed in,/not bothering to hide the chill in his voice. His sharp tone made it clear he was done listening.



Catching on to Brendon's foul mood and
wanting no part in what might follow, Yolanda looped her arm through Katie's and nudged her away.



Once Yolanda and Katie disappeared from view,Brendon's eyes trailed after Christina's back as she walked away with the manager. His thoughts churned. Something about watching Christina walk off left a bitter taste in his mouth.He couldn't name the feeling, but it scratched at the edges of his calm like a thorn. The discomfort reminded him of tossing aside something insignificant-only towatch someone else treasure it.




Brendon's jaw tightened as he frowned, eyes narrowing while Christina walked out of sight.Food sat untouched in front of him, and he loosened his tie with a sigh, suddenly stifled by the weight of his own frustration.




...



Away from the buzz below, the top floor revealed a very different world.



Christina stepped into a quiet space where refinement lingered in every corner.
By the grand window, Dylan sat in a tall-backed chair carved with intricate details, his presence commanding without trying. A lavish spread waited on the polished wood table-wine,porcelain, silverware-all arranged like a private banquet for royalty.
Dylan was the only one in the room, and though he sat with ease, there was something about him that made the space feel charged. He carried himself with a quiet, commanding grace, like someone out of reach, wrapped in both power and poise.



Christina blinked. So, this was the elusive owner of the Morfort Restaurant-the very employer the manager had spoken of.



Christina led Davina over and took a seat without hesitation, a playful note in her voice as she said, "Looks like Mr. Scott's got a request for me."
###Chapter 14 Who Exactly Was Worth All This Effort...
Christina knew Dylan wouldn't have pulled back the curtain on his role of being the mysterious owner of the Morfort Restaurant unless he needed something from her.



"I do need a favor," Dylan said without hesitation, cutting straight to the point.



For a moment, his eyes lingered on Christina,and the usual frost in his stare melted just enough to reveal something softer. People always pegged her as a simple housewife,someone forgettable. But even without the Rose identity or that trophy from the shooting competition, she had an undeniable presence.There was a kind of quiet poise in her, the kind one couldn't fake.



"So, what exactly do you want from me?"Christina asked,her tone steady.



With unwavering focus, Dylan replied,"I need King's treatment opportunity to save someone.I don't care what it takes-I'll pay whatever it
someone forgettable. But even without the Rose identity or that trophy from the shooting competition, she had an undeniable presence.There was a kind of quiet poise in her,the kind one couldn't fake.


"So, what exactly do you want from me?"Christina asked, her tone steady.


With unwavering focus, Dylan replied,"I need King's treatment opportunity to save someone.I don't care what it takes-I'll pay whatever it costs."


A single brow lifted as Christina smirked."Anything at all?"

"Every cent, every favor. Name it," he said without missing a beat.


A laugh slipped out of her. "Even your life?”


That question hung in the air, teasing and sharp.Before Dylan could muster a response, Ralphy strolled in just in time to catch the tail end.With a chuckle, he interjected, "You've got guts, Miss Jones."


While his words carried amusement, his eyes told a different story. He scrutinized her,intrigued. This woman didn't flinch or stumble.Whatever softness she showed was surface-level. He'd never seen anyone-let alone a woman-speak to Dylan that way./And to do it
with that kind of ease? Unheard of.


"Not really," Christina said, flashing a composed smile.


Davina mumbled with foods in her mouth,"Christina's the best."


Ralphy,catching only part of it, looked curious."What was that?"


"I said, Christina's the best," Davina said between bites, not bothering to look up.

Ralphy chuckled, genuinely entertained by Davina's confidence. "You sure do hype your friend up."


Without missing a beat, Davina finally lifted her head, her face alight with excitement. "Why wouldn't l? Christina's amazing."

That look in her eyes said it all-pure, unshaken pride in her friend.


"Don't forget Dylan's got a pretty solid reputation too," Ralphy remarked/grinning as he leaned back slightly.


Ralphy brushed off her enthusiasm, chalking it up to friendly loyalty. Christina's talents in various fields hadn't hit him/yet. Only later,after one reveal led to another like falling dominoes,would he realize just how wrong he'd been.
"Please," Davina sneered, rolling her eyes before returning her attention to her plate. No matter what anyone said, in her world, Christina stood at the top. No contest.



Rather than feeling slighted, Ralphy found Davina's sass a little charming. She was refreshingly bold-nothing like the polished women he usually met.



Christina turned her gaze to Dylan. "So, have you decided?" Her voice was casual, but her eyes didn't miss a thing.



With no hint of hesitation, Dylan nodded. "lf that's the only way to secure King's treatment,I'm willing to give my life."



There was no bluff in his tone. He meant every word.



Christina stared at him, noticing the steel in his expression. It wwas the look of someone who'd already accepted the cost. Who could possibly mean so much to Dylan that he'd be willing to lay down his life without a second thought?Something about it tugged at her curiosity.Who exactly was worth all this effort from him?
"I'm not saying that to impress you," Dylan added, thinking she might not believe him.



Christina's lips curled into a faint smile. "I know you're serious. But death isn't the currency I'm after. I've got other terms in mind."



Interest sparked in Dylan's voice."What kind of terms?"
###Chapter 15 His Imagination Ran Wild
Christina gave a casual shrug. "Still thinking it over."




Across the table, Dylan leaned in slightly,his tone unwavering. "Whatever you decide,the terms are yours to set."



"What if I asked for your entire family?"Christina asked, her voice calm but firm as she suddenly dropped her light expression.



The question hit like a stone tossed in still water,the mood shifting in an instant. Anyone listening might've thought Christina meant to strip the Scott family of everything they had.



Dylan, however, didn't flinch. A half-smile tugged at his lips. "My life's worth more than the Scotts put together. If I'm ready to hand my life over, the rest is just background noise."



That made her laugh-sharp and sudden."That's sharp. Alright."



With a smooth gesture, Dylan lifted his glass.
"To making this work."



"To making it work. But..." Christina raised her glass.



"But what now?" Ralphy interjected, his voice tight with barely concealed impatience.



Christina's eyes flicked toward him. "But I can't promise King will agree. That part's out of my hands."



"No guarantees are fine with me," Dylan said at once. "If there's even the tiniest chance, I'll take it."



Even if King declined, Dylan still hoped Christina could broker a meeting. That alone would be worth something.



"Alright then." Without hesitation, Christina finished her wine in a single go. It surprised her,honestly-that Dylan, known for being cold and calculated,could care this much about someone.Maybe he wasn't made of stone afterall.



As Christina and Dylan exchanged conversation over their meal, Brendon sat off to the side,clearly ill at ease. Not even /the elegant dishes or rare wine could distract him. His mind was a
carousel of bitter possibilities of the nature of Christina and the restaurant owner's relationship.Was Katie right? Had Christina cheated on him during their marriage? And worse-had he been blind to it all, just another fool left out of the story?



Images he wished he could block out crept in anyway-Christina, caught in an intimate moment with the mysterious owner of the Morfort Restaurant.



Each new thought dragged Brendon further into a spiral, his expression growing darker with every passing second. His fingers wrapped tighter around the wine glass, the strain in his grip enough to make the stem creak.



Silence pressed down on the table like a weight.Katie stole a glance at him but didn't dare open her mouth.



Yolanda clenched her jaw, trying to mask the irritation simmering just below the surface.Clearly, Brendon wasn't as detached from Christina as he liked to pretend. Now that the Mitchell family was in trouble and desperately needed the Dawson family's support, she knew she had no room for mistakes. The idea of Brendon and Christina reconnecting was
unacceptable,especially now. Plus, she'd always been the one to call the shots in a breakup. The thought of being cast aside? Unbearable.



Why is Christina still not back?" Yolanda asked purposely, her voice light with feigned worry."Could something happen between her and the owner of the Morfort Restaurant?"



Katie let out a sharp laugh. "Wouldn't be the first time she threw herself at a man. Since the divorce, she's been busy collecting admirers.Bet she was cheating long before the divorce."



"I don't think she's that kind of person,"Brendon interjected, though doubt lingered in his tone.



And once doubt took root, it never stopped growing. He had never once had faith in Christina. His focus on her? It was about pride -his pride. He simply couldn't tolerate the thought of being cheated on.



"Brendon, can you stop being so naïve?" Katie snapped, her patience wearing thin. "She's nothing but a tramp."



That did it. Brendon turned his glare on her.
"One more word about her, and your allowance
is gone. Try me."



Katie fell silent, but the fire in her eyes never dimmed.She shifted her anger toward Christina instead,convinced that everything had started going wrong the moment Christina showed up,making Brendon, the ever-doting big brother,scold her more than before.



Irritated, Brendon tugged at his tie,the tension sitting heavy on him. No matter how hard he tried, his mind still clung to suspicions of Christina's loyalty.



Meanwhile, at the top floor, the group had just finished eating and brought their conversation to a close.



Christina, feeling the wine settle in, stood to leave. But as she moved, her balance gave out,and she toppled forward, landing squarely against Dylan's chest.
###Chapter 16 Difference
Most expected Dylan to move without hesitation, distancing himself the moment Christina stumbled. They knew Dylan despised any physical contact that appeared to be intentionally flirtatious.



In the dim light near the entrance, the manager stiffened, panic creeping into his chest like a slow burn.Would Christina be another person to incur Dylan's wrath and get thrown out?



Yet, what followed left the entire room in stunned silence.



Rather than stepping away, Dylan proactively reached out to support Christina, his response swift and precise.



Ralphy and the manager widened their eyes,their faces registered with disbelief. Could this truly be the same Dylan they knew?



The very man who had always shied away from even the lightest contact was now voluntarily helping Christina up. It was a sight so out of character that none of them had witnessed
anything like it before.



Ralphy's mind wandered to a different scene-Katie had flung herself at Dylan, only for him to swerve so fast that she practically crashed into the floor. The memory made the contrast blinding. Dylan's reaction toward Katie had been ruthless. But with Christina? He was gentle.



Ralphy's gaze toward Christina grew more intrigued. Was this woman truly special to Dylan,or was Dylan only helping her because of some deal they had struck?



A slow, amused grin played on Ralphy's lips as he continued watching, savoring every second of the unfolding twist. Perhaps Dylan might start wooing Christina soon.



"Are you alright?" Dylan asked, his voice touched by an unusual softness in his otherwise guarded tone. Christina's unique scent drifted into his nostrils, faint but intriguing enough to make him linger.



"I'm okay," Christina said, finding her balance as she met his gaze with a calm smile. "Thank you for catching me."



Though even without him, she would have kept
herself from falling onto the floor, she still acknowledged his effort.



"There's no need for thanks," Dylan replied casually. "We're sort of business partners,after all."



"You're right," Christina said with a nod."Since we're partners, it's only natural we look out for one another."



"Right." Dylan nodded.Strangely,when her claim leaned toward the business angle instead of personal concern, a wave of displeasure stirred within him, a peculiar feeling he couldn't quite name. No clear reason came to mind for the discomfort that crept in so suddenly. Still, he brushed the feeling aside, locking it away behind habit and control.



To keep his position as the owner of the Morfort Restaurant under wraps, personally walking them out was not an option. Instead,Dylan gave the manager a quiet nod, signaling him to see them off.



The three stepped into the elevator, and as they stepped out, Christina declined the manager's offer to escort them further, saying she didn't want to become the center of
attention.




WatchingChristina and her friend leave, the manager lingered for a beat before turning back to report back to Dylan.


Outside Morfort Restaurant, Katie and her crew still lingered.
"Why are we just standing around like lost puppies?" Katie asked,clearly irritated.



Yolanda said gently, her words measured to appear concerned while carrying implications,"Let's wait for Christina a little longer. After all,she has once taken care of Brendon, and we shouldn't walk off, not when she had been summoned away by the owner of the restaurant and still hadn't returned yet. Brendon may have faith in her, but we still don't know enough about the owner of the Morfort Restaurant. What if he tries to force himself on her..."
The implication tightened Brendon's jaw. For a second, a flicker of worry showed in his eyes before he looked away.
"For Christ's sake, she's an adult! Wouldn't she fight back if she didn't want it? If she gives in,then maybe she wants it. Why should we even care? For all we know, she's probably enjoying the intimate encounter," Katie sneered, her voice sharp with irritation, and a flicker of jealousy slipping through.



How could someone like Christina-a divorced woman with a messy past-manage to catch the eye of the owner of the Morfort Restaurant?



"Katie Dawson, Don't forget what I warned you about," Brendon hissed, his voice turning frigid as he locked eyes with her, his stare cutting cold.



Before Katie could respond, Brendon spotted a familiar figure. Without another word, he left them behind and strode quickly toward Christina,his expression cold as he blocked her path.
###Chapter 17 Spit It Out Or Step Aside
Ice crept into Christina's eyes the instant she recognized the man standing in her path.Without blinking, she leveled her gaze and said,"Step aside."



"We need to talk. Just for a minute-away from the others," Brendon said, not budging an inch.



As he reached for her hand, Christina pulled back sharply, not even flinching. "What's stopping you from saying it right here?" she asked, her brow tightening.



Brendon shot Davina a look that said more than words and then reached his hand out once more."Some things are not meant for the ears of the outsiders."



"She's not an outsider," Christina retorted,dodging his reach again. Her eyes were cold as they locked onto his. "Cut the crap."



Her tone-calm but sharp-cut deeper than he expected. Being treated this way in public, with eyes possibly watching, left a sour taste in his
mouth.
"Spit it out or step aside," Christina added, her tone sharp and cold. "I have no intention of dealing with your nonsense."



A strange discomfort settled over Brendon. The ink on their divorce certificate hadn't dried yet,but she had already become so detached and aloof toward him. With a mocking smile, he sneered, "What, no time for me, but you've got time to flirt with the Morfort Restaurant's owner?"
"There's nothing improper between me and the owner of the Morfort Restaurant. Whatever you're imagining says more about you than it does about us," Christina retorted, her face unreadable.



A dry, bitter laugh spilled from Brendon."Oh?What's with the urgent clarification? It seems my words struck a nerve."



Davina let out an exasperated sigh and stepped forward. "This again? Have you even thought before you spew all that nonsense? If you've got no point to make, then get out of the way."



Brendon cut her a glare, full of irritation. "This
doesn't concern you. Stay out of it."



With a sharp snort, Davina folded her arms."That's rich coming from you. You two are divorced."



Color rose in his face, but words refused to follow. He stood there, visibly fuming as he fumbled for words to form a reply.



"Move, Brendon. We're done here," Christina commanded, her voice slicing through the tension.



That simple command made him frown.Watching the unwavering look in her eyes, he knew he'd hit a wall if he pressed on.Reluctantly, he decided to change tactics and lied, "My grandma's been asking about you. She wants us to visit her. Said she misses both of us."



Christina didn't flinch. "Not today." She wasn't in the mood to go.



"If we keep putting it off, she's going to start worrying," Brendon said, trying again, his tone gentler now.



The mention of Bethel gave Christina pause.Her expression shifted as she considered it, her
brow creasing. Among all the Dawson family members, only Bethel had ever made her feel welcome. Truth be told, Bethel had offered the kind of affection none of the others had. Over time, she had come to see Bethel as her own grandmother. Judging from Brendon's words,Bethel probably had no clue about their divorce.
"Please, I am begging you," Brendon added, his tone taking on a softer edge. "I just got a call that my grandma's not doing well."



A short pause followed before Christina gave a reluctant nod. "Alright.I'll go. But only to see Bethel."



"Good," Brendon replied with a relieved sigh."I've already arranged for a car.We'll head over together."



Davina, however, wasn't thriled about Christina going to the Dawson family's house. But she knew exactly how stubborn Christina could be -once she decided on something,there was no use arguing.



"Promise me you'll be careful. And if anything feels off, call me right away," Davina said to Christina,her voice thick with concern. Her eyes then shifted to Brendon, sharp and unforgiving.
"If you so much as look at her the wrong way,swear you'll regret it."
Brendon scowled, clearly irritated. "This doesn't involve you. Stay out of it and mind your own problems."



"Nah, I will step in the moment you try anything funny," Davina retorted, clenching her fists so tightly that her knuckles turned white. If she had her way, she'd have decked him right there.What a complete loser. Every inch of him was so infuriatingly annoying. Just the sight of him made her nauseous. Seriously, the Dawson family had some nerve. They'd somehow managed to rope in someone as extraordinary as Christina and trap her in that miserable marriage for three whole years. Without her,Brendon wouldn't even have registered as average.



Suddenly, a blinding pink sports car skidded to a stop nearby, its engine growling like a beast.A loud whistle followed, garnering everyone's attention.
###Chapter 18 Don't Think Of Marrying A Wealthy Man...
All eyes snapped to the source of the screeching tires and blaring whistle.



Inside the loud pink sports car, Ralphy flashed a mischievous grin, his gaze fixed on Christina like she was the only one there. With a smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth,he said,"Need a lift home,Miss Jones?"



Brendon's jaw tightened instantly. First the Morfort Restaurant's owner had shown interest in Christina. Now Ralphy was here, all grins and casual flair. Earlier at the shooting range, Dylan had done the same-stepped up to speak for Christina without hesitation. The memory of his sister's blunt comments came rushing back.A question crept into his mind that he didn't want to answer-had Christina already been involved with these men before their divorce?




"I'm good," Christina replied, her tone cool and unbothered. She slipped an arm around Davina."But if you don't mind, could you take my friend home instead?"
It was clear Davina had had more than a few drinks, and driving herself wasn't an option.



"Anything for you," Ralphy replied, flashing a boyish grin. "Just say the word, and I'm on it."



Christina nodded in thanks, steadying Davina as she helped Davina into the passenger seat.



Despite his laid-back attitude, Ralphy's friendship with someone like Dylan hinted there was more to him than just flash and jokes.



"I've got it covered, Miss Jones. Your friend will get home in one piece. And if she doesn't, you can hunt me down personally." Ralphy shot her a wink,still grinning like this was the highlight of his night.



"Take it easy on the road, alright? No need to rush," Christina remarked, tilting her head slightly, her voice calm but firm.



Ralphy gave a casual salute. "Loud and clear."Then,with a glance at Brendon and a grin that held more meaning than words, he added, "If anybody bothers you, just say the word. I'll handle it."



That earned him a small smile from Christina,
subtle but sincere.



Moments later, the flashy pink car roared off,disappearing into the distance.



With his lips pressed into a hard line, Brendon stepped closer, eyes narrowed. "What's going on between you and him?"



Christina didn't blink. "Why are you asking? It has nothing to do with you."



Brendon's expression darkened. "We were once husband and wife. I'm only speaking out of concern. Men like Ralphy-the wealthy,charming types-are always tangled up in rumors and short-lived flings. You shouldn't fool yourself into thinking you'll suddenly be swept into high society just because one of them shows interest. Those elite circles aren't as welcoming as you might believe. Even if someone like him wanted to marry you, his family would never accept a woman who's already divorced.




The only reason you ever became part of the Dawson family was because my grandmother's insistence. Without that, you wouldn't have made it in. I'm just afraid you'll start chasing something out of reach, trving to live in a world
that won't have you, and end up hurt because of it. And when that happens, you'll have no one to blame but yourself. Don't twist what I'm saying. I know it's blunt, but it's the truth. It's better to stay grounded in reality than get swept away by empty dreams."



A laugh escaped Christina before she could stop it, low and amused. So, that was his message in a nutshell-a divorced woman should forget about marrying up. Her time in the Dawson family? Nothing but a lucky accident.



"That's very thoughtful of you," Christina said,her smile faint but firm. "But here's a tip-people who focus on their own problems tend to live longer."



Brendon's eyes narrowed as he caught the bite in her tone. "Are you cursing me?"



With a casual shrug, Christina replied, "Nah.But if you have to twist it that way, by my guest."



His temper spiked fast. "Christina Jones! I gave you more than enough to live comfortably.What more do you want? Why are you still out there, parading around with other men?"



She didn't even blink. "Other men?" she asked
with a humorless chuckle. Her stare didn't waver."Tell me, Brendon. What exactly have I done?Where's your proof?"



"Isn't it clear? First, it was Dylan, and then the Morfort Restaurant's owner. And now Ralphy.Don't tell me you're going to stand there and deny all of it," Brendon blurted, locking eyes with her, waiting for her denial as if it was the only thing that could settle the unrest inside him,the only way to quiet that bitter suspicion clawing at his gut.



He didn't love Christina, and he never had any real emotional ties to her. He could excuse his own betrayals without guilt, but the idea of Christina doing the same-that was something he couldn't stomach.
###Chapter 19 You Could've Just Not Married Me In Th...
Christina saw no point in offering explanations.Brendon had already passed judgment, so nothing she said would matter. With a shrug, she said purposely, "I am exactly what you think lam.How's that concerned you? After all, you're just my ex-husband now!"



She lingered on the words "ex-husband," letting each syllable slice through the tension like a blade.



Instead of denial, her unapologetic admission threw Brendon off,and his features twisted with anger at her blunt dismissal. "You're free to do whatever you like now, but were you already sleeping around while we were still married?" he demanded,voice raised.



A cold chuckle slipped from Christina's lips."That's rich coming from you. If you want answers about my loyalty during our marriage,I can ask you the same question."



Brendon retorted, "I never cheated on you-
when did I ever step out on our marriage?"


She rolled her eyes, the sound of her laughter bitter. "Come off it. Even with a ring on your finger,your heart always belonged to someone else." Her gaze flicked to Yolanda, a hint of scorn curling at her mouth.



Yolanda's voice trembled with mock regret."Christina, I... I'm sorry..."



In an instant, Brendon reached over and took Yolanda's hand, his expression softening for her.He faced Christina again, voice turning cold and matter-of-fact. "Yes, I never loved you. This marriage was forced on me, and I admit l treated you poorly these last years. But wasn't the settlement I gave you enough? You got more out of this divorce than most could hope to make in a lifetime. Three years, and now you'll never have to worry about money. Most people would kill for that kind of deal. Christina,I owe you nothing.Yolanda doesn't owe you,either. The real mistake here was this marriage -it never should've happened."



A sharp, cold laugh slipped from Christina."So,you think I owe you and Yolanda? You claimed this whole marriage was some grand mistake?But you could have saved us both the trouble
by simply not proposing in the first place."



Had Brendon given even a hint of hesitation before their wedding day, Christina never would have said yes. All along, Brendon's choices revealed his selfishness. After Yolanda left him shattered three years back with the abrupt departure overseas, he had grabbed her as a substitute to fill the void, especially given that she had been there to take care of his wounds left by the accident.



"My grandmother pushed me into marrying you,"Brendon said, brows drawn in irritation.



"Is that so?" Christina's voice held a mocking edge. "Funny, I don't remember you putting up any kind of fight. Pressure or not, you had options. You just didn't use them."



"I couldn't exactly refuse! Not marrying you would've meant losing my place in the company,"Brendon retorted, exasperation creeping in.



"So much for true love. It falls apart as soon as your bottom line is threatened," Christina said,her words dripping with sarcasm.



Katie suddenly barged into the conversation,bristling with indignation. "What's that supposed
to mean? Quit trying to sow discord here!Yolanda and Brendon are perfectly happy together, and your spiteful comments won't change a thing. Don't fool yourself-Brendon isn't coming back to you, and you can forget about ever remarrying into the Dawson family!"



A glacial chill settled over Christina's features."You read too much into it. Even if the entire Dawson family came crawling, I wouldn't rejoin them."



Katie's laugh was sharp and derisive. "Oh,come on! Don't flatter yourself. No one in my family wants you back. With your reputation for fickle and shamelessness, you're nothing but trouble -no respectable family would take the risk.Forget about high society. Even average people wouldn't want you around."



Ice glinted in Christina's eyes as she fixed her stare on Katie. "You might as well worry about your own skeletons. Wouldn't want a few nasty secrets ruining your shot at marrying up."



A flush of panic washed over Katie. "My skeletons? What are you talking about?" Her voice faltered, eyes darting away from Christina's gaze as unease flashed across her face. Facing Christina always unsettled her,leaving her with the unsettling sensethat nothing could be hidden from those sharp eyes.
###Chapter 20 Flustered
"No one is more familiar with the truth than you are," Christina remarked, her tone cool and steady as she smirked at Katie.



Confusion creased Brendon's brow. "What are you getting at? What kind of skeletons does Katie have in the cupboard?"



"That's a conversation you should have with her.I couldn't care less about her affairs," Christina answered, sounding indifferent. Had Katie not provoked her, she never would have mentioned a thing.



A gentle protest slipped from Yolanda,her words deliberately chosen to ingratiate herself with the Dawson family while casting a negative light on Christina. "Christina, please refrain from casting baseless accusations against Katie. If someone overheard our conversation, they might start gossiping about Katie."



"You're the one making baseless accusations here. If you doubt my words, ask Katie about what she has done," Christina replied with a cold edqe, qlancing over at Brendon. "Aren't we
supposed to see your grandmother? Let's move."



"Not until you explain what you mean."Brendon's jaw tightened.



Backing him up, Yolanda chimed in, "Yeah.Christina, let'sclear the air if there's any misunderstanding. This way, no one will get the wrong idea about Katie."



"Katie, they're so determined to hear the truth.Should I spell it out right here?" Christina's question lingered in the air. She let a sly grin curl her lips, flicking a meaningful glance toward Katie's midsection-a gesture that said more than words ever could.



Others might have missed Christina's quick,pointed look, but Katie's panic made her notice instantly.



An uneasy thumping filled Katie's chest, and she bit down hard on her lip. She viewed Christina's stare as a loaded threat. Despite her defiance,she dared not challenge Christina, not when the risk of Christina holding actual proof of her misdeeds loomed large. If her wrongdoings became public knowledge, her dream of marrying into an elite family would be crushed,and even those with lesser names would likely
keep their distance.



Trying to mask her panic, Katie blurted, "What's there to clarify? I haven't done anything, so what's the point in talking?" She swiftly changed the subject. "Are we heading to the Dawson estate or not? Stop wasting time! Grandma's probably tired of waiting. If we're not going,then forget it."



"We're going-Grandma's expecting us,"Brendon replied without hesitation. Making Christina come to see his grandmother was a crucial step before he could talk her into handing King's treatment opportunity to him.

"Then let's get moving!" Katie spun around,desperate to put distance between herself and Christina before the conversation returned to her misdeeds.



Yolanda turned to Christina, her words measured as she piled up on her efforts to make Christina appear vicious. "Christina, we may have hurt you before, but there's no need to invent things about Katie. She means well-she's just a little blunt sometimes."



Christina didn't hesitate to fire back. "Then keep your comments to yourself." She climbed into the car without another word.
Brendon's first instinct was to scold Christina,but he bit back his frustration due to his need to strike a deal with her over King's treatment opportunity. He turned to Yolanda with gentle reassurance, giving her hand a soft pat. "Don't let what she said get to you."



Ever the skilled actress, Yolanda made sure she looked aggrieved yet understanding, nodding as tears threatened to spill from her eyes. "Alright."



The ride was silent, tension thick in the air.Christina gazed out the window, lips pressed together in silent resolve.



Yolanda and Katie were dropped off at their respective homes first, and then the car headed to the Dawson's family estate.



Bethel had never hidden her sharp tongue-Katie took the brunt of it, and Yolanda didn't fare much better.



Back in the day, only Christina enjoyed unrestricted access to the Dawson family's estate. Bethel's approval was never required.



"When do you plan to tell Bethel about our
divorce?" Christina broke the silence. She wished Brendon would finally step up and handle the situation like a man.
"I'll do it when the moment's right," Brendon replied, avoiding her eyes.



Christina didn't see the point in waiting. "Why drag it out? Let's just tell her today and be done with it." Her voice was flat, betraying nothing.



A frown creased Brendon's brow. "You're really in a hurry to sever all ties,aren't you?"



"We have no ties left to sever," Christina answered.



Her response caught Brendon off guard, stirring an odd frustration in him. With a trace of spite,he responded, "You won't have to worry. I'll make sure Grandma hears everything.Since the divorce is settled and Yolanda's back, I'll be with Yolanda now. Maybe you'll even get an invitation to our wedding."
###Chapter 21 Come Clean
"That won't be necessary-I wish you and Yolanda a lifetime of happiness," Christina said,her tone even.



A heavy ache settled in Brendon's chest,making it hard to breathe. He tried to say something,but the car rolled to a stop before the words could leave his mouth.



Christina stepped out swiftly and left him behind,frustration and heaviness pressing down on him like a stone.



Having been informed of their upcoming visit,Bethel had been waiting by the entrance,scanning the drive with anticipation.



As soon as Christina appeared, Bethel's whole face lit up. A genuine smile broke through as she hurried forward to greet Christina.



"It feels like ages since you last stopped by,Christina," Bethel called out, her gray hair shining and her eyes lively with joy.



Months of Christina's attentive care had done
wonders for Bethel's well-being-she now brimmed with vitality.



A soft smile touched Christina's lips. "I've just had a lot on my plate lately..."



Bethel squeezed Christina's hand, the mischief plain in her eyes. "Did Brendon not exercise any restrait in intimacy, overwhelming you?"



This caught Christina off guard, leaving her a bit awkward. Her eyes darted away from Bethel's open warmth,unsure what to say.



Concern flashed across Bethel's face as she caught the subtle shift. "Something wrong? Has Brendon been giving you grief?"



Christina shook her head. "No,nothing like that..."



Before Christina could add anything further,Brendon quickly interrupted. "Let's continue this conversation inside."



"Yes,yes,come in! The kitchen's outdone itself -there's a full spread of your favorite dishes waiting. I even asked for a nourishing soup,perfect for both of you!" Bethel's face brightened as she agreed.
Deciding to avoid the topic of divorce for now,Christina shifted the conversation, chatting with Bethel about lighter things as they walked. She knew springing the news of their divorce before dinner would only spoil Bethel's mood, so she chose to hold off until after the meal.



Bethel made sure Christina and Brendon sat side by side and then ladled steaming soup into each of their bowls with care.



"I had this made just for you two-drink it while it's warm," Bethel said, her voice warm and gentle.



"Thank you," Christina murmured, dipping her head to taste the soup.



A smile crept across Bethel's lips as she watched Christina and Brendon, feeling hopeful that any tension between them seemed to have faded.She imagined she'd soon be cuddling a great-grandchild.



"All I want now is to see a great-grandchild in my arms, and then I'll be perfectly content,"Bethel said with a chuckle.



"You can count on that, Grandma-your wish
will come true." Brendon flashed her a reassuring grin.



Christina gave a gentle smile, choosing silence instead.



Throughout the meal, the atmosphere stayed light enough, though an undercurrent of discomfort lingered whenever conversation drifted back to Christina's relationship with Brendon.




After the meal,Bethel took Christina by the arm and led her into the living room to chat.



Initially, their conversation stuck to safe topics,but it wasn't long before Bethel steered things back toward the subject of Brendon.



Leaning in and squeezing Christina's hand,Bethel spoke with quiet urgency. "My dear, my strengthisn't what it used to be. I'm not sure how much time I have left. All I want now is to see you and Brendon start a family soon."



A wave of sorrow swept through Christina."Bethel,you're still healthy-don't talk like that.It's not good to focus on such worries. Besides..."



Pausing for a moment, Christina wrestled with
her words and then made up her mind to speak the truth. Honesty was best, she realized.Letting this drag on would only make everything worse.The last thing she wanted was for Bethel to hear the news of her divorce from someone else. That sort of surprise would only be cruel.



Christina said gently, "Actually, Brendon and I are already divorced."



Bethel stared at her in stunned silence, thinking it must be a joke-until Brendon suddenly barked, "Christina!"



The sudden outburst snapped Bethel back to herself."Is this true? You two are really divorced?"



Trying to cover it, Brendon jumped in, saying,"No! She's making things up-it's just a joke."



Yet, Christina didn't waver. Refusing to look away from Bethel, she ignored Brendon's warning glare and said, "This isn't a joke. The divorce is real-it's already official."
###Chapter 22 Ungrateful
"What on earth are you doing, Christina?"Brendon's voice was sharp, thick with anger.



Christina stayed calm, her expression unreadable. "I just told the truth. Bethel deserved to know.What's wrong with that?"



"You-" Brendon started, but Bethel's voice cut through his like a knife. "That's enough! Why are you raising your voice at her?" she demanded, her eyes narrowing at him.



Despite her age, Bethel's gaze was sharp as ever. She looked at Brendon. "Now tell me-what's really going on between you two? Why did you get divorced?"



Brendon let out a heavy sigh. "Grandma, you already know. There was never any real love between us. Marriages fall apart when there's nothing left to hold them together."



Christina remained silent, though inside, she was laughing bitterly. If Yolanda hadn't come back,would Brendon have kept pretending instead of demanding a divorce? Of course, he would have.
It worked to his interest that way.



Bethel gave a harsh, humorless laugh. "Don't try to play me for a fool. I may be old, but I'm not stupid. Either you tell me the truth now, or I'll find it myself."



Brendon hesitated, jaw tight. He knew what would happen if Bethel found out on her own.And it wouldn't be pretty. Finally, he muttered,"Yolanda's back..."



Bethel shot to her feet, slamming both hands on the table. Her eyes burned with fury. "I told you before-l will never allow Yolanda to join this family!"



"Grandma!" Brendon's defiance flared. "Yolanda and I love each other! Why can't you just accept her?"



"Love?" Bethel scoffed. "You think this is love?You're the only fool who can't see her for what she is! That woman disappeared the moment the doctors said you might never walk again years back! Did she even call? No! Not once!"She pointed a trembling finger at Christina."And who stayed by your side? Who looked after you when you couldn't even stand on your own? Christina did. Day and night. She was the
reason you recovered. Even the doctors said it was a miracle-and that miracle was her doing!"



Brendon rolled his eyes. "Yolanda had no choice.And fine,maybe Christina helped a little, but my recovery was all about my own willpower and strength. Anyone else could've taken care of me, and I still would've walked again!"



Christina's lips twitched slightly. She didn't say a word, but inside, she was seething. If it weren't for her-her medical knowledge, her sleepless nights, her silent sacrifices-Brendon would've been trapped in that wheelchair forever. That miracle he took credit for? It was hers.




Bethel's eyes flared. Without warning, she lifted her cane and struck Brendon across the shoulder."You ungrateful fool!" she spat. "How did ourfamily raise someone as ungrateful as you?"



"Ungrateful?" Brendon's voice rose. "I gave Christina enough money to live comfortably for the rest of her life! All I want now is to marry the woman I love. Is that so wrong?"



Bethel's grip on her cane tightened, fury dancing in her eyes. She lifted it again to strike,
but Brendon caught it midair this time. His jaw was set, eyes blazing. He growled, "I'm done backing down. I will marry Yolanda."



Bethel's chest heaved as she trembled with rage."Fine! Marry her, then!" she spat. "But listen carefully-she will never be officially acknowledged by the Dawson family. Not while I'm alive!"



Brendon stared at Bethel, torn between frustration and disbelief. Why did she defend Christina so fiercely yet reject Yolanda with such disdain? He had compromised once, bowing to his grandmother's wishes. But not this time.Not when his heart was on the line.



"My decision's final," Brendon said, his voice cold but steady. "I will marry Yolanda, the woman I love. No one else could ever take her place." His eyes flicked to Christina as he spoke,deliberate and pointed.



Bethel's expression darkened, her voice a low,venomous whisper. "Then go ahead-marry that woman. But the day you bring that woman into this house is the day you lose everything."



Her heart ached at the sight of her grandson throwing away a diamond for dirt. One day, he'd understand what a fool he'd been-but by then,it would be too late.
Brendon stood taller, rebellion surging through him. "Grandma, give it up! I'll never go back to Christina. I've made my choice-I will marry Yolanda,and no one's stopping me."



"You-" Bethel gasped mid-sentence. A sudden tightness seized her chest. Her cane slipped from her hand as she staggered, clutching her heart.With a choked cry, she collapsed to the floor.



"Bethel!" Christina and Brendon shouted simultaneously, rushing to her side in panic.
###Chapter 23 Agreed To Put On An Act
The atmosphere in the hospital was taut, thick with unease.



Bethel had been rushed into the ER, leaving Brendon outside-pacing, fidgeting, unable to settle.



Only now did the gravity of it all hit Brendon like a punch to the chest. Anxiety clawed at him.The weight of the Dawson legacy rested squarely on his grandmother's frail shoulders. If she faltered, everything they built would come crashing down.



Brendon's eyes cut to Christina. "This is your doing," he said, voice quiet but laced with steel."I told you-we needed the right time to tell my grandmother. Not like this."
Christina didn't argue. She couldn't. A part of her knew she'd triggered Bethel's collapse.



"When my grandmother gets through this-and she will-you're going to follow my lead,"Brendon said firmly. "We can't afford another
shock. We keep her calm. We keep her safe."



That snapped Christina out of it. She turned sharply, her gaze like ice. "What do you expect me to do? Pretending we're back together?"



"It's a performance. Don't make it more than that," he said with a sneer. "Even with my grandma in your corner, don't kid yourself-you'll never have my heart. The whole acting is strictly for her sake. Don't get delusional."



Christina let out a sharp,humorless laugh. "Wow.Your ego's still the size of a small planet,huh?Relax.If every mman on Earth vanished overnight,I'd still never come crawling back to you."



Her words sliced through him, drawing blood he didn't want to show. Anger sparked-but then,something else. She must be bluffing. He could see it. Women always masked their feelings behind sharp tongues and cold stares. She was just trying to protect her pride. After all those years of devotion, of her orbiting his world like he was her sun-she couldn't have just let go.Not completely. Not really. That thought calmed him and even fed a quiet, smug satisfaction.
He exhaled, his scowl melting into a faint,
knowing smirk. "Just play your part when my grandma's around. That's all I need.""Fine," Christina muttered, her tone clipped, her posture rigid. She agreed-for Bethel. The woman had once lifted her from rock bottom,offering refuge when betrayal had left her shattered and alone. Bethel had shown her nothing but warmth and compassion, and for that, she would endure this farce with Brendon.



Brendon felt a rush of satisfaction from her quick agreement. He knew it. She still had feelings for him. How could she not? "Then hand over the treatment slot with King," he said,emboldened by her agreement.



Christina's glare could've turned lava to ice."I've already told you-no."



"You'd really risk my grandma's life? King could save her!" Brendon shot back,frustration etched across his face. But that wasn't the truth. He wanted King for Yolanda's illness.



"Bethel has been stable for years. Her chronic conditions are managed, and her vitals are strong. She doesn't need King-any competent surgeon can handle this," Christina said, voice unwavering. She'd made sure of it. For three
painstaking years, she had taken care of Bethel -tracked every symptom, followed every treatment. Bethel's body was stronger now.She had done her homework. The surgery wvas routine, the risks minimal.



Brendon's jaw clenched. "So you're willing to roll the dice with her life? Can you live with that if something goes wrong? Even healthy people die on the table-what about an elderly woman?""If you really care about her, you'll hand over the treatment slot. It's the only way to ensure she survives."



Each word dripped with manipulation, cutting into her patience like glass. She knew exactly who he was fighting for-and it wasn't Bethel.No way was she going to hand him that win.



"I can find another way-" she said, but a shrill scream split the air.



"You bitch!" A hand came flying at her-fast,wild, and furious.
###Chapter 24 Joselyn
The slap was a breath away from Christina's cheek, but in a flash, she pivoted, dodging cleanly. Her hand shot up, catching the attacker's wrist midair and wrenching it in one fluid,brutal motion.



"Ah! Ouch,ouch, ouch!" Joselyn Dawson,Katie and Brendon's mother, cried out, her face twisting in agony, pain etched deep into her furrowed brow.



"Mom!" Katie and Brendon shouted at once,panic lacing their voices.


"Christina, let go!" Brendon barked, lunging in and yanking at her wrist.



Katie hurried to intervene, reaching to pry Christina's fingers away, but she didn't need to.Christina had already released her hold, cold and calculated.



Joselyn cradled her wrist,stunned and trembling.Had no one stepped in, there was no doubt in her mind-Christina would've broken it clean.Ruthless didn't even begin to cover it.
"Disrespecting your elders is one thing," Joselyn snapped, her voice razor-sharp as her glare bore into Christina, "but now you've pushed Bethel into a hospital bed with your theatrics-what do you have to say for yourself?"



Joselyn's dislike for Christina ran deep. To her,this woman was unworthy of her son-no pedigree, no influence, no place in their world.If Bethel hadn't insisted on that godforsaken marriage, Christina would've never gotten to marry into the Dawson family. Her son deserved better. Someone like Yolanda-refined, well-connected, useful. Not Christina, who was nothing but a liability, dead weight dragging him down.



"You have no right to accuse me of anything,"Christina replied, voice calm but cold, her chin lifting with unshakable defiance.


That expression-it drove Joselyn mad. The arrogance. The nerve. The way this nobody stood there like she owned the room, like she belonged.



"No right?" Joselyn hissed. "Bethel is my mother-in-law! And you are the reason she's lying in that hospital bed! If she dies-I'll see to
it you rot in jail."



Christina's gaze didn't waver. "All I did was break the news of the divorce. Your precious son is accountable. He argued with her and raised his voice,insisting that he marry Yolanda. He's the one who pushed Bethel over the edge. Not me."
Christina's voice cut like tempered steel. Yes,maybe she'd played a role in Bethel's collapse -but Brendon lit the fuse. He'd stoked the fire.Without him, Bethel might have been upset-but she wouldn't have collapsed in that chair,gasping and pale.



Christina wasn't about to lie-but she sure as hell wasn't taking the fall for all of it.



"Christina, you bear undeniable responsibility in this," Brendon said, his brow furrowed with exaggerated gravity. "If you hadn't brought up the divorce, none of this would've happened."



Christina let out a sharp, humorless laugh. "Did you really think you could keep it a secret forever? Not everyone's as clueless as you seem to hope. And newsflash-the divorce is real.I have every right to speak the truth."



Katie's voice exploded like a grenade. "Grandma
was perfectly fine until you showed up! The minute you stepped into that house, she ended up in a hospital bed. This is all on you!"



"Exactly!" Joselyn snapped,her voice like venom."If anything happens to her, you'll pay dearly."



Brendon pounced, seizing the moment like a vulture. "Christina, let's not make this harder than it is. You're not blameless, and you know it.Give up your treatment slot for my grandma,and we'll move forward-no grudges."


"Never," Christina replied, her tone flat, final.



Brendon's frown deepened, twisting into disappointment. "Christina, how could you be this heartless?"



Katie threw up her hands. "See, Brendon? I told you she was vile! After everything our grandma did for her-this is how she repays her?"



"Trash. That's all she ever was!" Joselyn snarled furiously. "A gutter rat clinging to scraps of power she doesn't deserve. Bethel must've gone mad,wasting all that affection on such a woman instead of her own blood!"



Christina remained stone-faced. "I'll get Bethel
a surgeon. If she has the operation and proper post-op care, she'll recover fully. That's what matters."



Katie burst out laughing, cruel and shrill. "You?Don't make me laugh! You couldn't even book an appointment with a half-decent doctor, let alone someone reputable. Just admit it-you want her dead. You'd hand her off to a back-alley butcher and call it 'help'. My grandma gave everything to you, and you repay her with betrayal!"



Christina didn't flinch. Her next words cut through the chaos like a blade. "I'm bringing in Dr. Calvin Emmett."
###Chapter 25 A Wager
"Wait-what did you just say?" Gasps filled the room as everyone stared in disbelief. Calvin Emmett? The country's most renowned surgeon?The one even the mighty Dawson family couldn't get an appointment with, no matter how much money or influence they threw around? And now Christina-someone they'd all written off as a washed-up nobody-claimed she could bring him here?



Brendon blinked in disbelief. "Hold on. Are we talking about Dr. Emmett? The top cardiac surgeon in the entire country?"


Christina met his gaze without flinching."Yes.Him."



Katie let out a sharp, disbelieving laugh. "Oh,please. Do you hear yourself? That's ridiculous!"



Joselyn folded her arms, her tone edged with scorn. "Let's be real. Even our family couldn't get through to him, and you think you can? The man's practically retired!"



Brendon gave a mocking laugh. "Christina,
you've been out of the game for years. You've spent the past few years behind closed doors,reduced yourself to household chores. You don't have the influence-or the contacts-to pull something like this off."



Christina's voice was calm, but there was steel beneath it. "Who I know and how I get things done isn't your concern. What matters is-I will bring him."



Katie laughed louder, clutching her stomach."The arrogance! Do you really expect us to believe you've got a direct line to Dr. Emmett?"



Brendon tilted his head, his expression softening,mockingly so. "Just give King's treatment opportunity to me, Christina.Save yourself from the humiliation."



Christina hadn't planned on rising to their bait,but the condescension,smugness, and absolute dismissal in their voices pushed her past silence.She tilted her head slightly,a cold smile playing on her lips. "And what if I do bring him? What then?"



Brendon rolled his eyes. "You can't possibly make it."
"Then let's make itinteresting," Christina said,her voice cool and sure. "A wager."



Brendon raised a brow. "What kind of wager?"



Christina's smile widened. "If I manage to get Dr.Emmett here, every single one of you owes me a public apology-and five million in compensation."



Katie's eyes narrowed. "And if you fail? What then? What if Dr. Emmett doesn't even step foot here,let alone operate on my grandma?"



"Then I'll forfeit my shot at treatment from the great King-and pay you five million," Christina said firmly,her tone razor-sharp.



Brendon's interest wasn't in the money. But the chance to claim King's treatment? That was something else entirely. His heart skipped a beat at the thought. If he won this bet, he could use the treatment opportunity on whoever he pleased-no one could argue against it.



"Deal." Brendon agreed without hesitation. He didn't believe for a second that Christina could pull this off. If the Dawson family, with all their wealth and influence, had failed to reach Dr.
Emmett,how could Christina possibly succeed?She must be clinging to illusions, still trying to win his attention. Pathetic.



Katie exchanged a triumphant glance with her mother, both grinning fromn ear to ear. In their mind, this bet was practically charity. Not only would they earn the five million, but they'd also take the golden ticket to King's treatment. A double victory.



Yet, Joselyn wasn't thrilled at the idea of Brendon using King's treatment on Yolanda.That opportunity was priceless-capable of opening doors, sealing partnerships, and even elevating their family's position. Squandering it on Yolanda? That was out of the question.



Christina wasn't losing sleep over Bethel.She had already analyzed Bethel's condition during the ride to the hospital. Bethel's vitals held steady. Her body was still strong and resilient enough to withstand the episode.



As expected, Bethel was soon transferred from the emergency room to a VIP suite. Before long,she regained consciousness.



Once awake, Bethel wasted no time. She sent Katie and Joselyn out of the room, leaving only
Christina and Brendon by her bedside. Her voice was soft, but her eyes held a familiar glimmer."So,you tworeally aren't getting back together?"


Christina offered a warm but cautious smile."Let's focus on your recovery. We can talk about everything else later."



But Bethel wasn't letting it go. Her brow knit with worry. "No. I need an answer. If I don't hear it now, I won't be able to eat or sleep."


Brendon was quick to speak up. "Grandma, I'm sorry for how I've acted. I've been stubborn, but I'll think about trying again. Maybe we just need time-to rebuild what we lost."



Bethel turned to Christina with gentle eyes."And what about you, dear? If your heart's not in it, I won't force you. I just want to see you happy."



Bethel's words made Christina hesitate to announce her lack of intention of getting back at Brendon.Managing a smile, she said, "Maybe a little more time, and things will work out."



Bethel gave her hand a warm pat, sensing the hesitation but choosing not to press. "Alright.No matter what happens, you have my full
support."


"Thank you," Christina whispered.



After this talk, Christina didn't walk away.Instead, she stayed by Bethel's side for hours,quietly keeping her company.



Later, Bethel asked Christina to step out for a moment and then gave Brendon a private tongue-lashing.	She	madeit	crystal clear: Yolanda would never be accepted into the family.Ever.



Knowing better than to argue at this point,Brendon nodded along with everything Bethel said. He wasn't foolish enough to challenge her in this state. Eventually, he excused himself for a business meeting, leaving Christina to look after Bethel through the rest of the afternoon.



Only once Bethel had drifted off into a peaceful sleep did Christina quietly slip out,confident the nurses would manage the rest of the night shift.



As Christina stepped out into the crisp evening air, the weight of the day settled on her shoulders. She decided to grab something to eat before heading home.
But just as she reached the sidewalk, a black van screeched to a halt in front of her.



The doors burst open, and in seconds, a group of rugged men stormed out, closing in around her like a pack of wolves.
###Chapter 26 Acted Like A Damsel In Distress
In almost the blink of an eye, Christina found herself hauled into the back of a van, her mouth covered.



These kidnappers moved with chilling precision -their planning was evident in every lightning-quick motion, giving no one a chance to intervene.



Taking them down would have been child's play for Christina, but she decided against it.Curiosity outweighed caution. She let them believe she was too weak to fight back, wanting to discover who had gone to such lengths to snatch her off the street. Why not turn a little danger into an adventure?



No sooner had she been tossed inside the van than a wad of cloth was shoved between her teeth and ropes cinched around her wrists and ankles.



With a fiery glare, Christina glowered at her captors, her performance flawless-outwardly
furious,inwardly cool as ice.


"Mmmph! Mmmph!" Christina's body thrashed,and her voice came out muffled, a perfect imitation of terror and rage.


To anyone watching, she looked like she'd been scared senseless--flailing like a fish dumped on a cutting board.



"Enough! Shut up already! Move again and I'll slice you!" one man shouted, giving her a rough shove and shooting her a look brimming with malice.



Christina recoiled, letting tears spring to her eyes, her entire face the picture of utter despair.



Had Davina witnessed the scene, she'd have handed Christina an Oscar for her convincing display. On the inside, Christina was cold and unruffled-on the outside, she played the scared victim to perfection.


Convincedby her act, her captors lowered their guard and discussed among themselves."Women are always quick to start crying and making noise."
"Yeah,what else could you expect? Completely worthless."



"Don't take your eyes off her. If she tries anything,you'll answer to me."


Christina let her eyes fill with tears, her lashes glistening and her chin tucked, the very picture of terror. Yet, beneath that shivering facade,an amused smile flickered inside her mind.



"Damn, look at this chick. Wouldn't mind a turn..."one of the kidnappers said, unable to hide his leer.



A sharp elbow from the leader of the group shut the recent speaker up. "Keep your mouth shut! She's marked for the Terrells. You know how brutal that clan gets. We're not here to die."



The man scratched his head. "They're paying through the nose for this job, though. Makes you wonder what she did to get on their blacklist."



"No clue about the specifics. Word is, she messed up Jacob in a bar-left him permanently impotent."



"Holy hell! Never would've pegged her as the
type to pull something like that."



The group studied Christina with fresh suspicion,noting her tear-streaked cheeks and shaking frame, all an act for their benefit. It seemed impossible that someone so slight could have taken down Jacob Terrell and even destroyed his manhood. Their best guess was that Jacob had tried to force himself on her, never expecting a fight, and paid dearly for his mistake. Even so, the assumption left an uncomfortable tension hanging in the van,each man suddenly wary in his seat.



Bits and pieces of their conversation gave Christina all she needed to understand the situation. Apparently, that night at the bar,when those thugs tried to corner her, one of them-Jacob-had ended up permanently impotent after her attack.



The Terrells didn't hold a place among the true upper crust, but their wealth and connections ran deep-both in the boardroom and the back alley.



Jacob,notorious for his arrogance, was the sort of predator who believed the world owed him everything. and that no woman could say no.Any woman who happened to catch his interest
usually left the encounter scarred, especially if she dared turn him down.



A cold smirk tugged at the corners of Christina's mouth. If anything, Jacob had earned every ounce of his fate by foolishly provoking her. Someone like him practically invited retribution. Looking back, she wished she could've gone much harder on him.Letting him live, even impotent, was almost generous. Yet now, he'd found the nerve to strike back? He was courting death. If the entire Terrell family wanted to join the fight, then they, too, were lining up for destruction.



Just for an instant, hidden behind the facade of trembling fear, a glint of something ruthless and deadly flickered in Christina's eyes.
###Chapter 27 Jacob Showed Up
"Out! Move it!" A rough hand dragged Christina out of the van with little care.



Nothing but emptiness surrounded them-the landscape barren, an abandoned warehouse looming ahead like a warning.


Christina's ankles were trussed together, the rope giving her just enough freedom to shuffle, never enough to move fast.


Disheveled hair fell across her face as they pushed her ahead, her balance faltering more than once.



Her captors started chatting. "When are the Terrells supposed to show?"


"Just got a call-Jacob's coming himself to handle her."



A nasty click of the tongue followed. "She's in for it, then. Everyone knows about Jacob's twisted tastes in intimate encounters. He likes it when they scream in pain."


"Doesn't concern us. All we do is hold her till the
they scream in pain."


"Doesn't concern us. All we do is hold her till the Terrells arrive. We grab our money and disappear.No point sticking our necks out." Only thing to remember-keep your hands off the employer's target. Get the cash, and there's plenty of pretty chicks out there to play with later."


By this point, Christina had been tossed unceremoniously into a dusty corner.


Clouds of filth rose as she hit the concrete, the grime adding to her already battered appearance.She already looked a mess, and the dirt stuck to her just made things worse.


Beneath the surface, however, her mind was razor-sharp, nerves steady as steel, taking in every word they said. Hearing that Jacob planned to come in person, her mouth twitched ever so slightly, a glimmer of dark humor sparking in her eyes. So, she wouldn't even have to hunt the Terrells down-Jacob was volunteering himself for the slaughter. He thought he could break her and make her beg for mercy? How amusing. Let him dream. Jacob's arrival would be the signal.The curtain would rise on the true spectacle. Her captors would be granted front-row seats to her metamorphosis-from a seemingly cornered,
"Forget about running. You're not getting anywhere. Cooperate, and it'll hurt less. Sit tight!"That final threat hung in the air as the kidnappers sauntered out, utterly convinced she was too rattled to attempt an escape. In their minds, she looked too defeated, too broken to even bother trying. To them, she was just a caged sparrow-flightless,helpless.



They couldn't have guessed that as they lingered outside, passing cigarettes and checking their watches, Christina was already twisting her wrists against the ropes. She wasn't about to spring free just yet. The bindings were loose enough to slip in a second, but she bided her time, hidden by stillness.



Head dipped low, a subtle, chilling smile played across her lips. Her eyes glowed with a hint of red, a ruthless promise gleaming deep within.


A storm of cruelty and madness churned in Christina's eyes, as if some ancient beast waited to burst free. Had anyone glimpsed her expression in that moment, the raw threat would have sent them fleeing in terror.


"Mr. Terrel!!" A loud shout shattered the silence,paired with the abrupt cutoff of a car engine.
"Where's that little bitch?" Jacob's voice, thick with arrogance and malice, echoed into the warehouse.



"She's inside," came the immediate reply from one of the hired kidnappers.


"Stay here and don't let anyone in."


"Understood!"


Seated in a wheelchair, Jacob let one of his goons roll him across the dusty concrete. The woman inside had stripped him of his pride in a bar fight -left his manhood ruined and barely clinging to life. Retribution burned in his veins. Today, she'd pay for every humiliation.


Whispers had circulated for years: the elusive doctor King could supposedly repair injuries no one else dared to touch-even restore what had been lost and make it better than before.



Getting close to King, however, was nearly impossible. No amount of power or money had opened that door.


Left with no options, the Terrells had shifted their focus to the shooting champion, hoping to buy or bully their way into a miracle cure from King. But fate had a twisted sense of humor-the
bully their way into a miracle cure from King. But fate had a twisted sense of humor-the marksman they hunted was the very woman who'd destroved Jacob's manhood from the start.
###Chapter 28 One Last Chance
Every memory of that night sent Jacob's rage surging. He ached to rip Christina apart with his own hands. Having her at his mercy now,trussed up and powerless, meant he could finally unleash every grudge he'd nursed. He'd wring out the answer he wanted, forcing her to surrender her slot for King's treatment, and then take his time making her pay in ways she'd never forget.



Only when his appetite for vengeance was satisfied, only when he'd bled every last scream from her, would he grant her the release of death.



Yet,Jacob couldn't have imagined the truth: the object of his hatred, the so-called "worthless whore" he wanted gone, was King, whom the world's richest and most powerful would sell their souls to please.



Wheelchair wheels rattled over concrete as Jacob was pushed inside. His eyes quickly found Christina, slumped and apparently pitiful in the
shadowed corner, barely more than a battered stray.



Rage had knotted Jacob's jaw, but seeing her reduced to such a state sent a cruel shiver of satisfaction down his spine.


Where'd all that swagger go, huh? At the bar,she had acted like she owned the place. Now she lay at his feet, a wreck gasping for air,nothing but a shadow of her former self. But this humiliation wasn't enough. He needed to savor her suffering up close, to carve the lesson into her bones.



"So you're the sharpshooter everyone talks about?" Jacob's voice dripped with mockery.


Christina, ever the actress, trembled from head to toe, her reply ragged and frail. "Y-yes... W-what do you want from me?"



"You really don't remember?"Jacob's bloodshot glare bored into her. "After what you did to me at that bar?" His teeth ground together,fury on the verge of shattering him.



A feigned look of bewilderment crossed Christina's face. "Th-the bar?"
Jacob practically came out of his seat, fists shaking. "You bitch! All that arrogance, all that attitude-don't act like you've forgotten what you did! You wrecked me and now you play dumb?"



Her eyes widened as if a memory clicked into place. "O-oh, it's you..."


His laughter sliced through the air, bitter and sharp. "So, it finally comes back to you. Here's the deal-only King can heal me. Give up your treatment slot, and I might let you leave in one piece. This is your only shot."



A flood of tears welled in Christina's eyes, her voice trembling, as if she was truly terrified."That slot means everything to me. I... I can't hand it over."



A growl ripped from Jacob's throat. "Like hell you can't! You owe me for what you did. You'll pay one way or another!"



Christina held his gaze for a beat, appearing to cower before him, and then softly replied,"It's too late. I already sold the slot."


"What?" Jacob's face contorted with rage. The
urge to leap out of his wheelchair nearly overpowered him, but the agony in his body sent him crumpling back, breath ragged.



Hatred radiated from his glare, his voice a venomous hiss. "You had the nerve to sell it,you wretched slut? Who got it? Tell me!"



Christina's answer came out barely above a whisper, saying, "T-that's confidential... I can't say."



Jacob barely held himself back from lashing out-his whole body quaked with barely contained violence.After simmering in rage, he pulled on a mask of false gentleness,his tone dripping with deceit. "You know, you could always call off that deal. Give the slot to me instead. I'll let you walk out of here-maybe even with a pile of cash. But if you turn me down..."



His words hung for a moment before he leaned in, his voice dropping to a menacing hiss. "You won't live to see another sunrise."



No one could mistake his meaning. Far from trembling, Christina found a kind of dark amusement in watching him spiral out of control. "I'm not backing out of the deal.I keep
my promises," she answered, voice steady as stone.



With that,Jacob's thin veneer of calm shattered."One last time-are you sure you want to do this?"



Christina's chin rose, exposing the delicate line of her neck-defiance blazing in her eyes. "I am."



A twisted smile pulled at Jacob's lips, his fists balled tight with fury. "Fine. Have it your way."


Without a hint of mercy, he turned on his men.
"Get her clothes off. Now."



"Yes!" His goons leered and began to close in on Christina in the corner.
###Chapter 29 Don't Stop Until Each One Of Them Begs For Death
On the surface, Christina resembled a frightened rabbit-wide eyes, trembling frame-yet a sly smirk hinted at the steel beneath her facade.Long before now, she'd worked the ropes loose.These fools never stood a chance of holding her down. Fear was the last thing on her mind.


A glimmer of something fierce flashed in those tear-stained eyes as her would-be attackers lunged. Deep in her chest, a cold, silent laugh built. Just as she prepared to strike-


Bang! The crack of gunfire ripped through the warehouse. The closest thug dropped lifelessly,his body crumpling mid-step.


For a moment, stunned silence gripped the room.Every eye locked on the fresh corpse at Christina's feet.


Death's reek was unmistakable, thickening the stagnant air.


Bang! Bang! Bang! Shot after shot rang out.
Jacob's goons hit the floor one by one-like toy soldiers knocked over by an unseen hand. The goons posted outside had already been dealt with.


Only Jacob remained, the sole survivor in a sea of bodies. He shook violently, terror overtaking rage.That was when Dylan strode inside-cold and implacable, a shadow in human form, death glinting in his eyes.


The muzzle of Dylan's pistol tracked Jacob's every move, promising no mercy.


Jacob's nerves failed him. He lost all feeling in his legs. Survival instincts flared. He scrambled desperately, desperate to flee.


But Dylan's men dragged Jacob back, tossing him to the floor like discarded garbage.


Crashing to his knees, Jacob dissolved into hysterical sobs. "M-Mr. Scott! Please! I beg you-have mercy!"


The chill of a gun barrel pressed into Jacob's scalp, and sheer terror overwhelmed him-he lost control, urine soaking his pants as he shook uncontrollably.
"I-| didn't-Ah-!" A savage kick from Dylan landed on Jacob's side, shattering ribs before Jacob could finish his plea.


"Who gave you permission to touch the woman under my protection?" Dylan's voice was pure ice,lethal and unyielding.


The gun never wavered, trained on Jacob's head while the stench of fear filled the air. Utterly broken, Jacob could only gape, saliva dribbling from slack lips, his terror so complete that he lost the ability to form words. To him, Dylan wasn't human any longer-he was death incarnate,come to collect what was owed.


"From this moment on, the Terrell family is finished in this city. Find everyone involved in the kidnapping. Don't stop until each one begs for death," Dylan said, voice stripped of all feeling.


"Yes!" His men sprang into motion without hesitation.


Reduced to a blubbering wreck, Jacob choked out desperate pleas, his voice shredded by fear."Mr. Scott! Please-I'm begging you! Spare me!Spare my family! I didn't know-honest! If I'd known she was under your protection, I never
would have dared! Please, I'm sorry! Please!


Saltwater streaked Jacob's cheeks as he prostrated himself, his body racked with terror."Please... Mr. Scott! Mercy-just this once!I swear, I'll never do anything like this again!"


But no amount of pleading would save Jacob now.With Dylan's wrath unleashed, not only was Jacob finished, but the entire Terrell family faced obliteration.


A cold, derisive snort escaped Dylan, his eyes glinting with contempt as he stared down at the pathetic figure sprawled on the floo. "You're not sorry. You're just terrified."


Desperation took hold-Jacob crawled toward Dylan, but Dylan's men blocked his path without hesitation. "No-no, please! I beg you, I'm sorry!Mr.Scott,spare me...please!"


Jacob's wailing grew more frantic by the second,but not a hint of compassion flickered in Dylan's eyes. Those foolish enough to touch those under his protection had already sealed their fate.


"Get him out of here," Dylan instructed, his voice cold.
"Right away!" Without pause, his men grabbed Jacob, dragging him off like so much dead weight.


"Mr. Scott! No-No! Please! I was wrong! I was-"The shrieks rose, jagged and wild-screams of a man who already knew his doom was sealed.


Dylan's patience wore thin. He gave the slightest nod, and one of his men understood instantly.A quick chop to the neck ended the uproar. Jacob's body slumped over, mercifully silent.
###Chapter 30 The Contrast
Christina sat in the corner, still as stone, her eyes locked on the bloodied bodies scattered across the floor.Damn... Dylan wasn't one to waste time.


Dylan caught her dazed look and traced her line of sight. The carnage wasn't subtle-twisted limbs, lifeless faces, blood pooling beneath them like ink spilled from a shattered bottle.



He mistook her stillness for fear, and something unfamiliar twisted in his chest-sympathy and maybe even regret for letting her witness such a scene. His brow creased. Quietly, he crouched beside her. Without a word, his calloused palm moved to gently cover her eyes.



"Don't be afraid..." The edge in his voice was gone, replaced by something softer. "I'm here.You're safe."



With delicate insistence, he turned her face away from the bodies, guiding her gaze to him,shielding her from the worst of it. "Don't look," he whispered. "Just thinkof it like a bad dream, one you'll wake up from soon."
His eyes-dark,burning, unwavering-held hers in a quiet command, pulling her back from the brink.The usual frost in his eyes had thawed-scorched away by something unseen-leaving behind an unfamiliar warmth. Something almost gentle.



He waited, unmoving, until Christina gave a soft,shaky "Alright."


Only then did he allow himself a silent breath-one he hadn't realized he was holding. She was still fighting. That was a good sign. He tucked the thought away like a mission directive: Therapist.Tomorrow. No exceptions. Unaddressed,trauma wasn't a wound-it was a ticking time bomb.It crept in as nightmares turning shadows into monsters. This wasn't a fender bender or some close call. Christina had walked through hell's front door and barely made it back out.


His jaw tightened as he reached for the ropes,fingers steady but his mind storming. Then, he saw them. The deep, angry ridges across her wrists and ankles-skin rubbed raw, welts etched like curses.



Something inside him detonated. His eyes went dark, a dangerous shift rolling through him like thunder before a downpour. The Terrell family.They didn't deserve mercy. They didn't even
deserve fear. They deserved to die miserably.


"Does it hurt?" His voice came out low-rough like gravel, but carrying a strange softness underneath.



Christina shook her head."No."



She accepted his help, but as soon as her feet touched the floor, her knees betrayed her. Her legs folded, weak and trembling.


Dylan caught her in a flash-arms steel-tight around her, instincts faster than thought. For the first time, his iron composure had cracked. A flicker of flush-real and raw-flashed across his face like lightning slashing through stormclouds.


They froze. Her chest close to his, eyes locked,breath tangled in the sudden quiet. The air between them shifted, thick with an unspoken pull.


Seconds passed before reality reassembled.


"I-I'm fine," Christina blurted, trying to wriggle free. But then her knee brushed a scrape, and the pain hit sharply. She hissed softly, breath catching.


Dylan didn't let go. His gaze dropped to her swollen ankle. His frown deepened into
something lethal.


"Forgive me." Without waiting, he slid one arm beneath her knees and lifted her effortlessly into his arms. Reflex kicked in-her arms snapped around his neck, her cheeks flushing with heat.


"Seriously, I'm fine-it's just a scratch! You're overreacting," she muttered, flustered. To her,these minor scrapes barely registered-they weren't worth a bandage, let alone anyone fussing over them.


"A scratch is still an injury. I'm not overreacting,"Dylan said, his voice steady and unshakable.



Something fragile and unfamiliar stirred in Christina's chest. Her grip on his shoulder tightened, as if holding on might keep the feeling from slipping away.



She had once given everything she had to the Dawson family. To Brendon. Time, devotion,love -poured out like water into a cracked vessel that never held a drop. And what did she get in return?Not even the ghost of affection.



She could still recall that day in the kitchen-how the knife had slipped, the sharp sting followed by a rush of blood spilling across her palm.
Brendon had shot her a cold, indifferent glance,instructed a servant to fetch the first-aid kit, and walked off without a backward look. Not once did he ask how she was-not in that moment, not ever. It was almost cruel, the contrast. Even a stranger might've asked if she was okay. But Brendon, her husband at that time, hadn't even blinked.



And yet, she'd seen the way Brendon looked at Yolanda. Gentle hands brushing hair from her face. Soft words dipped in honey. He was capable of warmth-just not for her. Maybe that was the simple difference-love cared, indifference didn't.


A dull ache bloomed in Christina's chest.She had loved fiercely.Given without keeping score. And in the end, she hadn't even been worth a moment of kindness.
###Chapter 31 His Concerns
Dylan pulled Christina into his arms, shielding her from the violent scene behind them. He turned slightly, making sure her eyes wouldn't catch the bloodshed.



Then, lifting his gaze to his men, his expression hardened-sharp, cold, and commanding. The air around him grew heavy, his presence alone sending a chill through the room.


"Clean it up. Not a single trace left behind," Dylan ordered, his voice low but lethal.


"Yes!" His subordinates responded without hesitation, moving swiftly to carry out his command.


Still holding Christina close, Dylan walked away with the quiet authority of a man born to lead. His powerful presence radiated through the room,making everyone instinctively step back. His eyes, frigid and razor-sharp, could pierce straight through a person's soul.


Christina leaned against his chest, taking in the warmth of his embrace. Her gaze wandered up to
his strong jawline and sculpted features.Everything about him was impossibly perfect-handsome, yes, but more than that,magnetic.


"We'll stop by the hospital later for a check-up,"he said.


Christina stirred. "It's just a small scratch. No need to worry."


He looked down at her, and the chill in his eyes melted."Better to check it anyway. Otherwise, I won't be at ease."


That fleeting warmth in his gaze made her heart falter. It wasn't just his looks. It was the way he carried himself, how his quiet concern made her feel unexpectedly safe.


When she didn't respond right away, Dylan misread her silence. His voice dropped, coaxing,tender in a way only she ever got to hear. "Please.Just do it for me. A scrape might be minor to you,but to me, it's a big deal. We're sort of business partners. That means your safety is my responsibility."


Christina felt a gentle warmth bloom within her.Though they were merely partners, Dylan's concern was undeniably genuine. "Alright," she
murmured, giving a smail nod. Brendon hadn't even acknowledged her bleeding wound, while Dylan, merely a business partner, couldn't bear to ignore even the smallest scrape on her skin.One didn't need to love someone to show basic care.But Brendon hadn't shown even that.People were so very different.


As they approached the car, Christina shifted,glancing up at him. "You can put me down now.I can get in on my own."


Dylan respected her words, gently lowering her to the ground. "Okay. Just take it slow," he said softly.


"I will," she assured him.


But as soon as her feet touched the pavement and she bent to enter the car, a sharp jolt of pain shot through her skull.


"Ah-" Christina gasped, her brows knitting in agony. She had brushed it off as minor, but her vision dimmed abruptly, and before she could react,her body gave out.


In one swift, fluid motion, Dylan caught her in his arms. He exhaled quietly, relieved she hadn't hit the ground-but the worry etched on his face
only deepened.


"Christina?" he called out, his voice firm but laced with tension. No response. Panic flickered in his eyes as he quickly checked for signs of life-her breath, her pulse. Steady. Thank God.


Still, the knot in his chest wouldn't loosen.Something wasn't right, and that gnawing unease refused to let go.


Without a second thought, Dylan lifted her again and gently laid her in the back seat of the car.He shrugged off his tailored suit jacket and placed it over her, tucking it in with care. His brow was furrowed, his usual icy calm disrupted by the storm of worry behind his eyes.


The driver, having watched the scene unfold,sat frozen in disbelief.


In all the years he had worked for Dylan, never-not once-had he seen Dylan break his rules,especially not for a woman. And yet, here he was,treating Christina like she was the only person in the world that mattered.
###Chapter 32 The Unexpected Contact
"Just drive." Dylan's voice cut through the silence like a blade.




The driver obeyed without pause, and the car tore away from the scene, swallowing distance in seconds.




Christina slumped against Dylan, her body limp.He shifted to brace her,showing no resistance or discomfort.




His mind, however, was racing-every turn of the wheels a countdown. He needed her safe.He needed her stable. The road was no ally. It was jagged and cruel, each pothole a fresh threat.



Dylan instinctively adjusted her in his arms,nestling her closer, forming a barrier.
But then, the vehicle lurched.


Caught off guard, Dylan had no time to react.Christina, still unconscious, had no control over her limp body. The jolt caused her to fall against him, her soft lips brushing against the side of his neck.


The contact was fleeting, barely there. But it scorched. Like static under his skin, it froze him for a breathless second. But he didn't shift,instead, he just pulled her in tighter.


Christina remained motionless, her body warm and pliant against him, utterly unaware of the moment that had just passed.


She didn't see the way Dylan's usually composed face flushed a deep, unmistakable red-or how the tips of his ears burned with heat.


Dylan's pulse thundered in his chest, a strange flutter of emotion rising like a wave he couldn't name. He inhaled slowly, deeply, willing his heart to steady.


But when he looked down at her, asleep and vulnerable in his arms, his heart raced again.She was breathtaking. Delicate yet defined, with a beauty that didn't beg for attention-it simply existed, undeniable and effortless. But beyond
the surface, he sensed it: the grit beneath the grace, the quiet fire behind her gentle features.This wasn't a woman who broke easily.


Her elegant collarbones and the graceful curve of her neck only added to the quiet allure.



But Dylan's admiration quickly curdled into something darker as his thoughts drifted to her ex-husband. That bastard. How could anyone look at her and treat her like nothing?


Dylan scoffed silently. Her ex-husband was either a fool or blind-or both. And yet, he found himself feeling thankful. Because if her ex had seen her worth and cherished her the way she deserved,he might never have had the chance to know her like this. Perhaps the only good thing her ex ever did was let her go.


With that thought, Dylan's arms tightened around Christina. He held her as if she were something rare and irreplaceable-because to him, she was.



His gaze softened, the frost in his eyes melting into something far more softer. Her ex-husband failed to cherish her, but he wouldn't. Not now.Not ever.
The next morning, golden sunlight filtered through the curtains, bathing the room in a soft,honeyed glow.


Christina stirred beneath the sheets, sighing as she shifted and rolled over into the warmth.


Sleep still clung to her like a blanket-until something tugged at her instincts. Something was wrong.Different.


Her eyes flew open, sharp and alert. She scanned the unfamiliar space with practiced precision,every muscle on edge. This wasn't her room.


In an instant, her mind flipped through the chaos of the night before-the abduction. But after she got kidnapped, she recalled seeing Dylan.He was there to save her. Was this his place?


Her gaze dropped to her wrist. The raw skin had been cleaned and treated, a bandage neatly wrapped with care. A faint scent of herbs lingered -a cooling balm she vaguely recognized.


She sat up, gently tugging back the blanket to inspect her ankle. There it was again: a pristine white bandage wrapped around what had barely been more than a scrape.


A soft smile touched her lips before she could
stop it. All this effort for something so small.



It was barely a scratch, yet Dylan had taken the time to clean it, medicate it, and wrap it with care -like it actually mattered.
###Chapter 33 Timing Is Crucial
Christina slowly shook her head, a chuckle escaping her lips. Soon, a quiet warmth began to spread through her chest, softening the unease that lingered within her.


It was then that she noticed the black silk nightgown she was in. She froze. When had she changed? Who had changed her? Her mind immediately went to Dylan. Could it have been him?



Uncertain and slightly embarrassed, Christina reached up and gently tugged at the neckline,holding it closer to her skin.


Before she could dwell on the thought any longer,a soft knock echoed at the door.



She stood and crossed the room, opening the door without thinking. She was just about to ask who had helped her change-when the sight before her made the words vanish from her lips.



Instead of Dylan, a young girl stood outside,beaming with cheerful energy. Her presence felt like a ray of sunshine breaking through stormy
skies.


Christina quickly sized her up. The girl was beautiful-striking, really-with a mixture of youthful innocence and a touch of boldness in her features. Something about her face felt familiar.She looked a little like Dylan. But her pallor gave her away. Though her smile was bright, her lips were pale, and there was a faint weariness around her eyes.


Christina could tell right away-the girl wasn't well. And whatever she was battling, it wasn't something minor.


There was a spark in the girl's eyes, a curious and joyful smile that tugged at Christina's heart. It carried a quiet strength but also a hint of fragility.


It was easy to picture the girl as a bright, lively soul. Yet, illness had dimmed some of that light,stealing pieces of her energy. Still, she glowed with quiet resilience. She faced her struggles head-on, refusing to let her spirit break, and holding onto hope with courage.


"Good morning!" the girl said brightly. "Are you hungry? Breakfast is ready. Come down when you feel up to it."


"You're Dylan's little sister?" Christina asked.
The girl grinned and nodded. "Yep! I'm Chloe.Dylan mentioned you fainted last night after being startled..."


Christina managed a small smile. "I guess I did."But she didn't explain. It wasn't exactly fear that had caused her to pass out.


"How are you feeling now?" Chloe asked, her eyes wide and sincere. "Better?"


"Much better, thank you," Christina said and then hesitated. Her fingers brushed the fabric of her gown. "Um, this nightgown..."


"Oh!" CChloe let out a small laugh. "That was me.Well,my maid and I. We helped you change and cleaned you up a bit." She leaned in slightly,grinning mischievously. "You didn't really think my brother would do that, did you?"


Christina's cheeks turned a soft shade of pink,and she let out an awkward laugh. "No, of course not. I should get freshened up."


Chloe gave her a playful wink. "Good. We're waiting for you downstairs. Don't take forever!"


"I won't," Christina replied, smiling back. There was something undeniably charming about Dylan's little sister.
Chloe dashed down the stairs, her steps light with excitement, and made a beeline for the kitchen.


Inside, the comforting aroma of pork rib soup filled the air. Dylan stood at the stove, focused,carefully stirring the simmering pot.


"Dylan, is the onion soup ready yet?" Chloe asked eagerly, inhaling the savory scent. "Christina's awake. She'll be down in a minute after she freshens up."②


Her stomach growled in response to the smell,and she licked her lips. "It smells incredible!"


Dylan didn't look up, but the faintest smile tugged at the corners of his lips. His voice was calm, but there was a softness in his tone reserved only for her. "Go sit in the dining room. It's almost done."


Instead of obeying, Chloe leaned against the counter and tilted her head at him, mischief dancing in her eyes. "Dylan, do you like Christina?"


His hand paused mid-stir. Just as quickly, his expression returned to its usual calm. "Who's been putting that idea in your head?" he asked,assuming it was Ralphy-his gossip-loving friend,
wno had been spreading rumors to Chloe.Whenever Ralphy and Chloe got together, it was like a nonstop gossip session.


Chloe grinned. "Nobody said anything. I figured it out on my own. I've got eyes, you know." She pointed to her big, sparkling eyes for emphasis.


Dylan sighed and reached over to lightly flick her forehead. "No, I don't like her. And stop playing matchmaker. This isn't one of your dramas."


He wasn't sure if Christina might be nearby,and the last thing he wanted was to make her uncomfortable. More importantly, he wasn't harboring any feelings. Or at least, that was what he kept telling himself.


Chloe gave him a skeptical look, not buying it for a second. "Really? You're not interested?" she asked, her voice teasing. "Because if you're not,someone else might be. Christina's absolutely gorgeous-you'll regret it if you don't act fast and someone else wins her over."



Love wasn't just about destiny-it was about timing. If a man waited too long, his chance could slip away forever. Tons of people had let their feelings go unspoken, losing the one they cared for simply because fear held them back.
###Chapter 34 Not Afraid Of Death
Chloe's words


made Dylan still, mid-motion, as Christina's face flickered unbidden across his mind.



Christina truly was extraordinary. Only a blind fool like her ex-husband could've failed to see her worth.



"Dylan?" Chloe's voice pulled at the edge of his awareness, but he didn't respond right away."Dylan!" she called out louder.


Dylan snapped out of his thoughts and turned to her."What?"


"The soup's about to burn!" Chloe's eyes widened as she pointed toward the stove.


Seeing the soup was about done, Dylan quickly switched off the burner.



Chloe gave him a teasing grin. "So, what kind of girl do you like? If Christina's not your type,I can set you up with one of my classmates."


Dylan's expression darkened instantly. "Stop playing matchmaker for me."
Chloe pouted, still playful. "I'm just trying to make sure you don't grow old and grumpy alone." Her tone shifted, softening. "With my health being what it is... Well, who knows how long I've got..."Her gaze dropped, lashes fanning over her cheeks.


For a heartbeat, a quiet shadow crossed her face.But just as quickly, she rallied, looking up with a bright, almost doll-like smile-big eyes, long lashes, and a sparkle that belied the heaviness she'd just let slip.


"Dylan!" Chloe gave his shoulder a playful smack,her voice laced with forced cheer. "The continuation of our family line is in your hands now,okay?"


She masked it well, but deep down, she knew her time was slipping away. The doctors had said she might have at most a year ahead of her, but she could just as easily be gone tomorrow.


That was the thing about life: it never asked for permission before changing everything.


Chloe had made peace with the unknown.Every sunrise was a gift. Every breath, a blessing. She chose joy where she could, laughter when it came. But no amount of optimism could fully
silence the quiet dread in her heart. Some nights,the thought of saying goodbye to the people who loved her-it hollowed her out. Their kindness,their unwavering support... It crushed her with love and sorrow in equal measure. She loved them too. Fiercely. The idea of leaving them was the one thing she wasn't ready to face.


Dylan looked at her-the radiant smile she always wore, those signature crescent eyes-but he noticed how red-rimmed her eyes were. "Chloe,"he said softly. "Don't think like that. You're going to be fine, I swear. Didn't I tell you? I got you that treatment slot with King." He tried to keep his voice light,reassuring.


She murmured, blinking away the tears, "I know,and I know it was Christina who made it happen.But whether King agrees to treat me and the odds of healing me..."


She trailed off, a brittle smile forming. "I'm not afraid of dying, Dylan. Not really. I'm just afraid of leaving you all behind. I love you too much. That's the part I can't handle."


Her voice wavered, her lips smiling even as her eyes betrayed her.


"You're not going anywhere," Dylan said firmly,
stepping closer. His voice had taken on steel now."If I have to fight Death himself, I will. Just like you did for me all those years ago."


And he meant it. If not for Chloe, he wouldn't even be here. She had once pulled him out of death's grip. She had saved him when no one else could. Now it was his turn to return the favor,even if it killed him. Some debts couldn't be paid with words.


Dylan reached out, his thumb gently brushing away a tear clinging to the corner of Chloe's eye."Stop crying," he said with mock severity."You look ugly when you cry."


"I am not ugly!" Chloe shot back with a laugh, her sorrow cracking apart like ice under sunlight."But... Am I being too greedy?"


"Of course not," Dylan murmured. "Wanting more time with the people you love isn't greed. It's human."


Chloe's eyes shimmered, but this time, it was with warmth."Having you all... That's the best thing that's ever happened to me." She then paused before adding with a cheeky grin, "Though it'd be even better if I had a sister-in-law."


"Quit fooling around and grab the bowls," Dylan
replied, his tone softening.


"Fine! Have it your way then!" Her laughter rang out like music, light and unrestrained, filling the kitchen with life.


It was hard to believe a laugh that vibrant came from someone living on borrowed time.


Still chuckling, Chloe grabbed the bowls and stepped out of the kitchen-only to halt abruptly.Standing at the corner was Christina.


Chloe blinked, caught off guard. She had no idea how long Christina had been there or how much she'd heard. "Christina!" she called out,her voice lifting slightly in surprise.
###Chapter 35 Her Lip Print
"I'll take those," Christina said with a gentle smile as she stepped forward and took the bowls from Chloe's hands.


Chloe blinked in surprise. "Wait, did you just come downstairs?"


Christina offered a light shrug, her voice teasing."Yeah,just now. Ran right into you."


In truth, Christina had been lingering just outside the kitchen, quietly listening to the warm laughter and the conversation between Dylan and Chloe.It stirred something in her. She had never known what that kind of sibling bond felt like.She had no family that cared for her. And sometimes, in moments like this, she found herself quietly longing for it.


There was a reason Christina had agreed sO easily to Dylan's request. It wasn't just his willingness to risk his life for others without hesitation-it was the sincerity that radiated from him. A sincerity she couldn't ignore. And just moments ago, hearing Chloe laugh-that carefree, heartfelt sound-another thought had
quietly bloomed inside her. She didn't want that laughter to fade. Not yet. Maybe not ever.


Footsteps echoed softly as Dylan walked over,ladle in hand. His gaze naturally found Christina.


"Dylan made some onion soup and a few dishes,"Chloe chimed in brightly. "But if you don't like them, we can mak<e something else."


Christina shook her head gently. "No, this is perfect.I'm not picky."


Christina's eyes flicked over to Dylan, pausing as she took in his appearance. He was wearing a sharply tailored suit, crisp and clean-but over it hung a soft pink apron tied snugly around his waist, and a dark scarf circled his neck. The contrast was almost comical. The mix of his formal outfit, the silent way he stood, and the large ladle in his hand made him seem both distant and awkward-a side of Dylan hardly anyone had ever seen. She didn't mind the pink apron but the scarf had her puzzled. Why on earth was he wearing that indoors?


Before Christina could ask, Chloe followed her gaze to the apron and spoke up with a grin. "Oh,that apron? My mom picked it out. It's not his style at all."
Christina chuckled softly. "Your mom has good taste.It's really cute."


She meant it. The apron was adorable. Dylan's tall, commanding figure and cold, sharp features stood in stark contrast to the soft pink apron. The unexpected mix was a sight that almost felt too stimulating. If it weren't for the black scarf around his neck, she might have flushed at the sight of him.


Catching Christina's compliment, Dylan instinctively straightened his posture, a quiet pride blooming inside him. At that moment, an unexpected lightness lifted his mood, making him feel strangely tempted to turn on his charm.


Unable to hold back any longer, Christina asked,"Hey... Is your neck okay? Why the scarf?"


Dylan instinctively reached up and tugged the scarf higher around his neck. The spot where Christina's lips had brushed against his skin the night before still carried a faint mark-a subtle imprint, but one that hadn't faded completely. It wasn't obvious, but it was intimate and strangely persistent.


He didn't understand why he hadn't just washed it off. Instead, he had covered it up as if
preserving it meant something. "I've got a bit of a cold," he lied casually, his expression unreadable."Mild allergic reaction, too."


It was a convenient excuse. Unquestionable. Safe.Neither Christina nor Chloe dwelt on it.



Chloe just rolled her eyes playfully. "Don't mind Dylan," she said, looping her arm around Christina's with ease. "You must be starving.Come on, let's dig in!"


"Alright," Christina said with a soft nod,though her eyes lingered on Chloe for a moment longer.From what she'd seen so far, Chloe's health wasn't just fragile-it was concerning.


As the meal began and casual conversation flowed, Christina waited for the right moment.Then, gently setting her fork down, she reached across the table and lightly took Chloe'shand."Your hand's a little cold," she said casually as if simply commenting on the temperature. But in truth, she was carefully assessing Chloe's condition.


Chloe laughed softly. "My health's always been a little off," she said with a dismissive wave. "Cold hands are pretty normal for me. Nothing to worry about."
Christina's heart ached at Chloe's lightness and unshakable spirit. Her brows furrowed slightly. It was clear-Chloe's condition wasn't just "not the best." It was serious. Such a vibrant, lovable girl...It would be such a shame to lose her.



Christina looked from Chloe to Dylan, her expression growing serious. "There's something important I need to discuss."
###Chapter 36 King's Reply
Both Dylan and Chloe fixed their attention on Christina, curiosity and concern minglingin their eyes.



"If something's wrong, you can be honest with us.My brother won't let you down-he'll take care of anything," Chloe said, her voice full of support,assuming Christina was facing difficulties.


Dylan gave a quiet nod of agreement. "Just let me know what you need. I'll make sure it's handled."



Christina shook her head, offering Chloe a reassuring smile and giving her hand a gentle squeeze. "Nothing's wrong. Actually, King just reached out to me, and I haven't had a chance to share the news."


"What?" The siblings' reactions were instant-a chorus of overlapping exclamations, excitement barely contained in their voices.



Dylan was quite stunned. A swift response from King had been the last thing he'd expected. It seemed King's reputation for being elusive was solid. Not a single trace of the message remained
-King's reply had just reached Christina,unnoticed.


"What did King say?" Dylan asked, urgency tightening his tone.


Their eyes met, and Christina didn't hesitate."The patient you're desperate to save-it's your sister, isn't it?"


A somber nod from Dylan confirmed it, worry darkening his expression. "Yes. Her illness... Time isn't on her side."


At best, Chloe might have a year left-a truth that weighed heavy in Dylan's voice. He refused to let fate steal his sister without a fight.


Turning her attention to Chloe, Christina asked,"Do you ever get chills so deep that it feels like you're trapped in a freezer? And when that happens, do you also get splitting headaches?"


Chloe's eyes widened in shock. "Spot on! How did you know that?"


Dylan was equally taken aback, but in an instant,he understood-this must be King's diagnosis.A glimmer of hope sparked within him. If King, the miracle worker, could identify Chloe's symptoms from afar, maybe the odds of a cure weren't just a
fantasy after all.


"That's what King told me," Christina said smoothly, her gaze returning to Dylan. "And as for our agreement,King accepts."


Dylan's chest tightened in disbelief. "You mean...King really agrees to help?"


With a steady nod, Christina confirmed, "Yes.King has promised to cure your sister."


Relief and astonishment washed over the siblings,transforming their faces with sudden joy.


Chloe's voice shook with her overwhelming emotions. "Is that true? Really?"


She had already resigned herself to the idea that she had at most a year ahead of her, thus making the best of borrowed time and living each day as if it were her last.


Still, no matter how much optimism or strength a person possessed, the reality of mortality could drag anyone into despair at times.


Survival wasn't enough-Chloe craved life in all its fullness. She wanted to feel every heartbeat, to savor the ordinary moments and the extraordinary ones alike. So many faces came to mind-loved ones she couldn't bear to part with,
people whose lives were woven tightly with hers.The fear of saying goodbye to them was paralyzing. Even clinging to existence by a thread seemed preferable to letting go. The prospect of death was far more terrifying than scraping by.


A gentle but serious note entered Christina's voice, breaking through the wave of relief in the room."But..."


Dylan's grin faded, and hope drained from Chloe's eyes.


"But what is it?" Dylan asked, his tone shaded with new anxiety.


Christina explained, "King wants to get the cold spells under control before thinking about surgery -Chloe's condition has to be stabilized first."


Whatever King advised, Dylan was quick to agree."Anything King recommends, we'll do it. But can King really save Chloe?"


"If King says there's a cure, then there is one,"Christina answered with certainty.


The assertive tone struck Dylan as odd, though he couldn't say exactly why. Only later, when the truth about Christina's discreet identity as King came to light, did everything fall into place for
him. That absolute confidence in her voice finally made sense. She had spoken not as a messenger,but as King, the miracle worker herself. Such conviction could only belong to King in the flesh.
###Chapter 37 His Cooking Skills
"No matter how things turn out, it's always worth trying," Chloe said with a gentle smile. Her face was glowing, but the weakness in her body still showed.


"If even King can't heal me, then I doubt anyone else can," Chloe added quietly. King was her last thread of hope. She knew that clinging to expectations could be dangerous, but letting go felt even worse.


"You'll be fine. King is one of the best," Dylan said firmly as if trying to convince both her and himself. King was their last hope. He couldn't imagine what would happen if that hope disappeared.


Chloe leaned forward, resting her chin in her hands. Her eyes sparkled brightly, full of curiosity.Even though she looked tired and pale, her charm and youthful spirit still shone through. "I wonder what King is like. A man or a woman? Old or young? I'd love to meet King someday," she said with a hopeful look in her eyes. "It's such a pity l
don't have any talent for medicine. Otherwise, if l ever got the chance to meet King, I'd beg to become their apprentice."


Dylan arched an eyebrow and slid a bowl of soup in front of her. "You'd be wasting your breath," he said with a smile. "King doesn't take on apprentices.Now eat before it gets cold."


Chloe wrinkled her nose, stuck her tongue out at him, and then turned excitedly toward Christina."Christina! You have to try this!" she said, her tone bubbling with enthusiasm. "Dylan made it,and it's honestly amazing!"


Christina smiled and picked up her spoon, giving in to Chloe's cheerful persistence. The aroma alone was rich and comforting, and the first sip stunned her. The broth was deep and flavorful-savory, slow-cooked, and full of warmth.It tasted like something that had simmered for hours,layered with care.


She blinked, caught off guard. It had been years since she'd tasted soup this top-notch. If she hadn't seen Dylan in the kitchen herself, she would never have believed he could cook this remarkablv.
The memory surfaced vividly-it was during a prestigious cooking competition where she'd served as one of the anonymous judges. The winning dish? A bowl of onion soup that had left a lasting impression on her palate. And this one...tasted exactly the same. Not just similar-identical, down to the subtle depth of flavor and the delicate balance of spices.


Back then, the competition had been shrouded in secrecy. Contestants competed under codenames, their identities hidden. No one revealed their faces-not even the judges.Everyone remained a mystery, known only by their assigned numbers.


That had been the rule of the competition-strict anonymity. To this day, no one knew the true identities of the champion chef or the judges. All that was certain was that the juddges had been carefully selected by the organizers-big names in the culinary world, each carrying serious weight in the industry.


If she remembered correctly, the winner had competed under the codename Blaine. When Blaine first entered the contest, few had paid attention. The name didn't carry weight, and the
presentation had been modest. Almost no one placed bets on Blaine, assuming Blaine would be eliminated early, certainly not someone to make it to the top three.


But Christina had gone against popular opinion.Something about Blaine's first dish had caught her attention, and she'd quietly placed her bet on them.


To everyone's surprise, Blaine had swept the competition and claimed the championship.


Back then, Christina had been Judge Number 6.


For a fleeting moment, as Christina tasted the soup Dylan had made, a wild thought passed through her mind-could he be Blaine? But then she shook it off. Dylan was the head of the powerful Scott Group. He was a business mogul,constantly in the spotlight. There was no way he would've had the time-or interest-to enter a secret cooking competition.


"Is it good?" Chloe asked eagerly, watching Christina's reaction.



Christina nodded, still savoring the flavor. "It's more than good. It's incredible."
Chloe beamed, "Dylan seldom cooks. Even our family rarely gets to taste his food. His cooking skills are reserved for his future wife," she teased,shooting Christina a playful look. "I only get to enjoy it today because you're here!"


Then, Chloe leaned in closer, eyes sparkling with mischief. "Christina, have you ever considered becoming my sister-in-law?" she said with a grin."Just imagine it! Dylan is cooking for you every day, trying new recipes, and making all your favorite dishes. He's really amazing in the kitchen.Honestly, I wouldn't mind being the third wheel if it means I get to eat, too. Think about it. He's tall and handsome, cooks like a pro, and absolutely spoils the people he loves. In our family, the men are loyal to the core and treat their wives like queens."
###Chapter 38 Are You Talking About Babies With Dylan
A soft flush crept up Christina's cheeks under the gentle attention and eager smiles sent her way.Her gaze flicked over to Dylan, who watched quietly, expression unreadable, before she shifted her focus to Chloe.


A bright grin chased the pallor from Chloe's face,her sparkling eyes shining with hope.


Compared to Katie, Chloe radiated warmth and genuine charm.


"Alright, you win!" Christina gazed at Chloe and teased,flashing a playful smile. "But tell me, do you think your brother would mind a divorced woman?"


The answer seemed to throw Chloe off balance,her smile faltering. Clearly, Dylan had kept that detail close to the vest. Even Ralphy-never one to let a secret pass him by-hadn't breathed a word.


Christina let out a light laugh, unconcerned. "I'm newly divorced."
"Any children?" Chloe asked, curiosity spainiig in her eyes.


A short pause passed before Christina shook her head, her smile still in place. "No, there aren't any kids."


Her marriage to Brendon had always been in name only. Children were never part of the equation.


Chloe's disappointment was impossible to miss."That's too bad! I was looking forward to a niece or nephew right away."


Caught off guard, Christina blinked in surprise,not expecting such a reaction. All this time, she'd thought Chloe's question might be concerned about a divorcee joining their family, but clearly,that wasn't Chloe's worry at all.


"Don't fret," Christina replied, laughter dancing in her voice. "You'll get your wish for a niece or nephew soon enough."


Chloe cocked her head to the side, a mischievouS grin brightening her features. "Are you talking about babies with Dylan?"


A harmless joke had unexpectedly turned on Christina,leaving her cheeks even more flushed.
With a soft chuckle, Christina leaned in, voice lowered in mock secrecy. "That all depends on whether your brother's up for it."


"Of course he is! He'd be crazy not to!" Chloe shot her hand up, answering for Dylan without hesitation. "Honestly, I'd be thrilled! Christina,you're gorgeous. If you married Dylan, your babies would be adorable! I could parade them everywhere and finally have little ones to spoil!"


Chloe's infectious excitement made Christina burst out laughing, her eyes sparkling with real delight.


"Then I guess your brother and I had better do our best," Christina joked, playing along.


A vigorous nod from Chloe followed. "That's the spirit!"



Turning to Dylan, Chloe grinned slyly. "Dylan, you need to get your act together. The sooner you win Christina over, the sooner I get to play with cute nieces and nephews!"


Though Dylan stayed stoic, a faint blush crept up his ears. His face stayed as stern as ever, features unreadable and serious. "You should focus on eating. Not even a home-cooked meal can keep your mouth shut," he said, his voice cold yet
gentle as he shot Chloe a look tinged with affection.


With a cheeky gesture, Chloe stuck out her tongue before beaming at Christina. "Don't forget to eat, Christina! There's still more soup left."


"Alright." A gentle smile touched Christina's lips as she picked up her spoon and returned to her bowl of soup.


Christina had to admit, Dylan's skills in the kitchen were nothing short of astonishing. Each bite was so flavorful and rich that even she, no stranger to gourmet meals, found herself momentarily stunned. All this time, she'd pegged Dylan as the pampered type-his daily needs taken care of by the staff. Growing up with every luxury at his fingertips, it seemed natural to assume he left domestic chores to others.


Yet, here he was, the Scott family patriarch,serving up a breakfast worthy of a five-star chef.If he weren't so far out of reach, Christina might have seriously considered pursuing him. Failing that, she would've at least tried to poach him as her own private cook.


After breakfast, Christina gathered her things to head off to the hospital.
But as she reached for her bag, Chloe latched onto her arm, clearly unwilling to say goodbye."Do you really have to leave, Christina? Why not stay a little longer? There's plenty of space here-we could hang out, gossip, and convince my brother to keep spoiling us with his amazing food..."
###Chapter 39 Budding Feelings
Christina smoothed a gentle hand over Chloe's hair and offered a reassuring smile. "I can't stay,sweetheart. There are a few things I still need to take care of, and it's just not convenient."


Chloe's eyes sparkled with hope. "Why don't you let Dylan drive you around every day?" she responded, her voice soft and eager.


Chloe felt a natural warmth toward Christina even though they'd only known each other briefly. She already saw Christina and Dylan as the perfect pair, quietly rooting for them to become something more.


Christina's laughter was light, her eyes crinkling kindly. "Dylan's got his hands full these days. I'd feel terrible taking up his time," she commented,squeezing Chloe's hand in gentle affection.


Noticing how Chloe all but glued herself to Christina's side, Dylan finally stepped forward,shaking his head with a rueful smile as he gently pried Chloe off. "Easy there. Don't hang on her like that-she had a rough night, remember?"
At his reminder, Chloe's expression shifted instantly. She backed away, guilt etched across her features. "Sorry, Christina," she mumbled,sounding just like a child who'd been gently scolded.


Christina waved it off with a smile. "It's nothing-just a tiny scratch, honestly," she remarked, her voice warm and steady.


Seeing Chloe's disappointed look, Christina added, "Tell you what. I'll come visit whenever l can,okay?"


Christina planned to check on Chloe's recovery during every visit after she brought over the medicine that would help speed up Chloe's healing. Once Chloe was stronger and her immune system bounced back, she'd finally be ready for her surgery.


Chloe's whole face lit up, her eyes shining with delight. "Really? You have to promise you won't lie to me,okay?"


Christina couldn't help but smile resignedly. "I swear.I won't lie to you."


At that, Chloe finally relaxed and personally walked Christina and Dylan to the door.



During the ride, Dylan contemplated for a bit and then broke the silence. "Chloe can be a little blunt. Don't take her words too seriously-she just likes you a lot. Sometimes she gets ahead of herself because she cares."


Concerned that Christina might be angry, he offered a gentle apology in place of Chloe.


Christina gave a soft laugh, her tone warm and easy. "Don't sweat over it. I think she's sweet-and honestly, I was just joking with her so she wouldn't get down about being sick."


Her lighthearted tone caught Dylan off guard.For a moment, a subtle disappointment flickered in his chest. She really didn't seem bothered by Chloe's words of urging them together at all.


"If King reaches out, I'll let you know right away,"Christina offered.


Dylan answered with a subtle nod, "Thanks, I appreciate it."


She shrugged, radiating unshakeable calm. "It's nothing. It's what we agreed on, after all."


An uneasy flicker of irritation stirred beneath Dylan's composed exterior, though he struggled
to pinpoint its source. Was it her effortless detachment that unsettled him?


He glanced over, the usual chill in his gaze giving way to a flash of something softer-something he couldn't quite name.


Right at that instant, Christina sat in silence, eyes fixed on the scenery slipping past her window-each tree and building blurring into a gentle watercolor of light and motion.


Dylan, however, couuldn't look away from her.Sunlight drifted in, catching the fine strands of her hair and setting them aglow. For a moment,she looked ethereal, as if the daylight itself had chosen her as its muse.


He lingered on the shape of her profile, dazzled,until she turned suddenly.


Their gazes collided, a quiet electricity pulsing in the air between them.


In the glow of her clear, vibrant gaze, Dylan felt like he was staring into a mirror. Flustered, he cleared his throat, his composure slipped right back in, and his tone was guarded as he asked,"Are we going to your place, or..."


Christina snapped out of her thoughts and smiled
to ease the awkwardness. "Just drop me at the hospital. I need to see someone."


"Sure." Dylan's attention shifted to the road ahead,but his heart thudded unevenly in his chest.


Christina faced the window once more, outwardly composed, though her emotions were far from settled. A strange feeling was spreading through her chest. Was she actually developing feelings for Dylan? That was utterly ridiculous. She banished the thought as soon as it arose.


When they finally reached the hospital, Christina quietly thanked him, unfastened her seatbelt, and slipped out of the car.


Unbeknownst to either of them, in a darkened corner of the lot, a figure lingered-quietly raising a phone to capture the parting moment, hidden from view.
###Chapter 40 Forcing Christina To Surrender
Christina spent the entire day in the hospital room with Bethel, keeping her company, talking with her, and watching over her as she rested. Not a single member of the Dawson family had shown their face.



Only after Bethel had finally fallen asleep did Christina quietly step out.


As Christina exited the inpatient building, she came face-to-face with the Dawson siblings.Her steps slowed. Her expression hardened into a mask of ice. "Bethel's asleep," she said flatly, her voice cool and clipped. "If you want to visit,come back tomorrow."


Katie immediately bristled, her tone sharp."Since when do you get to decide when we see our own grandmother?"


Christina tilted her head, lips curling into a cold smile. "Your grandmother? You mean the one you didn't bother to visit once all day? What a privilege it must be to carry that title wvithout the burden of responsibility. Oh, should I praise you
for showing up now that she's asleep?"


Christina's words struck like a whip, precise and merciless. The Dawson family's indifference toward Bethel had long been a source of quiet anger for Christina, and seeing their smug, self-entitled faces now only poured fuel on the fire.Their callousness wasn't just disappointing anymore-it was infuriating. The Dawson family had no true successor-no one with the grit or vision to carry the business forward. And yet,they showed not an ounce of concern for Bethel,the very woman who had poured her life into keeping everything from falling apart.


"What's your problem? You think you can talk to us like that?" Katie, furious and humiliated, raised a hand to strike Christina, but Christina moved first-catching Katie's wrist mid-air.


"You really don't learn, do you?" Christina's voice was low, dangerous. Her eyes bore into Katie's with cutting clarity. "Tell me-if Bethel weren't around, how long do you think the Dawson family would last?"


Christina's words dropped like a hammer. Katie paled, trembling. The fire in her eyes flickered out,replaced by fear.
Christina released Katie's wrist with a sharp flick."Leave-before I lose what little patience I have left."


Katie's eyes welled with tears as she instinctively retreated, seeking refuge beside Brendon.


"Our family matters are none of your concern,"Brendon said coldly. He seized Christina's wrist in a punishing grip, a silent demand for submission.


But Christina didn't flinch. She met his glare with a chilling smile, refusing to show the pain lancing through her wrist. Her heart, already calloused from years of indifference, only grew colder.Did the Dawson family truly believe their empire had flourished these past three years without her own quiet efforts behind the scenes or without Bethel's sacrifice?


"Let go, Brendon," Christina snapped.



"Not until you apologize to Katie," he retorted,his grip tightening, cruel and deliberate.


"In your dreams. Why the hell would I apologize to her?"



Brendon's fury simmered just beneath the surface. But as he stared into Christina's Tenllrinalinem中hm中1teucke中mme im lio
presence, even when wounded-something shifted. Sympathy crept in, softening his anger.For a fleeting moment, he feared he might actually make her cry.


That hesitation was all Christina needed. She wrenched her wrist free and stepped back, her voice like frost. "I don't care about your family's affairs. But Bethel... She showed me kindness.That makes her my business."


Christina stared Brendon down, chin lifted high,the light catching the curve of her neck-a picture of poised defiance.


Katie, emboldened by Brendon's defense,snapped, "You say she's your business-then where's the surgeon you promised to bring? Still not here,right?"


"When Bethel's strong enough, I will bring Dr.Emmett over," Christina replied, her tone like stone. "Right now, what she needs most is peace."


"Oh, please!" Katie scoffed, her voice laced with contempt. "You're clearly stalling. Admit it-you can't even get in touch with this so-called Dr.Emmett." Her eyes narrowed with disdain. "Do you even realize who he is? You think someone
like you could invite him? Please. Get Real."


Christina was done wasting her breath. With an icy stare, she brushed past Katie. "You're in my way."



But just as Christina moved forward, Brendon stepped in, blocking her path once again.


"Move," Christina said flatly, her tone as sharp as a blade.



At this proximity, Brendon's gaze involuntarily dropped to Christina's neck. A faint blush colored her usually porcelain skin-soft, delicate, and unmistakably suggestive. In a flash, an image invaded his mind-another man, far too close,his lips grazing that very spot.


A visceral surge of jealousy and fury twisted inside Brendon. His fists curled into tight knots at his sides. This shameless woman. A minute ago,he'd felt a strange flicker of sympathy. But now,with that single glimpse, it was gone-swallowed whole by suspicion and possessiveness.


"Who is he?" Brendon demanded, his voice low but burning with fury. "Who were you with?"


Christina laughed-an elegant, derisive sound that only stoked the fire in him. "What the hell's
so funny?" he barked, his pride bruised.


"I'm laughing at you," she said, eyes gleaming with scorn. "The way you act... It's pathetic." Her voice dipped into a mockingly sweet tone."Brendon, in case it's slipped your mind, you're my ex-husband. You have no right to question me."


"What of it!" he snapped. "And don't forget-our divorce hasn't been made public. Everyone still thinks you're my wife. That means something."
###Chapter 41 Blocked Her Path
Christina let out a dry, bitter laugh, her fury barely held in check. Brendon had paraded around with Yolanda without a care in the world, ignoring every judgmental glance thrown their way. But she, his ex-wife, was still expected to play the role of a dutiful Dawson and guard their reputation simply because their divorce hadn't been made public? What kind of nonsense was that?


"Then hold a press conference tomorrow to announce our divorce," Christina said, her voice sharp with mockery. "Better yet, call the reporters right now. Make it public today."


Brendon's jaw tightened, a vein throbbing at his temple. "Is that how desperate you are to sever all ties with me?"


Christina met his glare with one of her own."Absolutely. Being connected to you is nothing but a disgrace."


"You-" Brendon was so enraged that he couldn't find the words to respond. How had he never noticed before just how sharp-tongued Christina could be? Her words hit like punches-hard, fast,
and impossible to dodge.


"I owe your family nothing, Brendon," Christina said, her tone like ice. "The moment we signed those divorce papers, I was done with all of you."


Christina had refrained from retaliating against the Dawson family for only one reason: Bethel,the woman who had once saved her life. She wasn't the type to forget a debt. But if the Dawson family kept pushing her, she wouldn't hold back anymore.


"Christina, do you really have to act this way?"Brendon asked, frowning deeply.


Christina gave a cold laugh, eyes narrowing. "This way? Don't pretend to be the victim. You started this."



"You know things weren't that simple," Brendon insisted. "None of us chose this situation. Not me,not Yolanda, not even you. I never meant to hurt you.Can't we at least be civil? I've always tried to treat you fairly. Plus, didn't | compensate you enough for the divorce-"


"Enough!" Christina snapped, lifting a hand to silence him. "I don't want your justifications. I'm tired,Brendon.I want to go home."
He stepped in front of her, blocking her path."You're not leaving until you answer me. Who were you with last night?"


He then pulled out his phone and showed her a photo-grainy, taken from a distance. It showed her stepping out of a sleek black car. The license plate was cropped out, and the driver's identity hidden, but it was enough to fuel his suspicions.He'd been restless ever since he saw it.


"Brendon, why are you wasting your energy on her?" Katie scoffed, striding forward with a sneer."She's just starving for attention." Her tone grew nastier with every word. "She's throwing herself at any guy who'll look at her-"


Brendon shot Katie a glare so cold that it made her flinch. Her crude words made his stomach turn. How could someone from such a respectable background talk like that? Who had she been hanging around?


Brendon turned back to Christina, his voice lower but firm. "Just tell me who you were with last night. If you explain, I'll believe you're innocent."



Christina let out a sharp laugh, tilting her head as though she'd just heard the most absurd thing imaginable. "I don't owe you any explanations,
Brendon. We're divorced. You have no right to question how I live my life."


Brendon's face darkened. "So this is what you've become? You've lost all sense of dignity?"


Christina raised an eyebrow, a small, mocking smile curving on her lips. "Dignity? If you're looking for shame, maybe try searching your own family first." Her eyes flicked to Katie-just for a second-but it was enough.


Katie flinched. Her spine went rigid, and her breath caught in her throat. "W-Why are you looking at me like that?" she asked, her voice trembling. "I haven't done anything wrong!"


Christina gave a soft chuckle. "Maybe you haven't. Or maybe you have. Only a proper investigation can say for sure."


Christina hadn't planned on involving Katie. But Katie had been asking for it-poking and insulting her.She had only responded in kind.


"Brendon, don't listen to her!" Katie cried, panic creeping into her voice. "She's just trying to cause drama. I've always followed our family's values-I swear!"


Brendon turned to her slowly, his gaze
unreadable. "Are you absolutely certain about that?"


"Of course!" Katie replied too quickly. "I'm your sister, Brendon. Are you really going to take her word over mine?" She pointed at Christina,pointing accusingly. "She's just jealous. She can't stand seeing us happy. She mocks Yolanda every chance she gets..."


That struck a nerve. Brendon hesitated, thinking back to Christina's cold remarks about Yolanda.The suspicion in his eyes began to fade. "That's enough, Christina," he said, his voice firm. "I don't believe a word you say. You're not going to drive a wedge between me and my family."


Christina gave him a cold look. "Believe whatever helps you sleep at night." Then, with a sudden shove,she pushed him aside. "You're in my way."


Brendon stumbled back, caught off guard by her strength. His foot slipped, and he nearly fell.


"Brendon!" Katie rushed to his side, grabbing his arm to steady him.


By the time he regained his balance, Christina was already walking away-her head held high,her steps light and sure, like she hadn't a care in the world.
"Christina! Stop right there!" Brendon shouted,frustration crackling in his voice.


But Christina didn't stop. She didn't even glance back. Divorce hadn't dimmed her. If anything, it had unleashed something stronger, something untouchable.


Brendon's heart ached with something he couldn't name. A hollow feeling gnawed at him as he watched her disappear into the distance. His chest tightened, and without thinking, he took a step forward, striding after her.
###Chapter 42 Brendon Became A Vegetable Again
"Brendon!" Katie seized his arm, her voice tight with urgency. "What the hell are you doing?"


"Let go!" Brendon snapped, his eyes glinting with warning as he wrenched his arm free.


Katie's jaw clenched. "No. I won't let you run after that wretch like some lovesick fool!"


"I said let go!" With a flick of irritation, Brendon shoved her hand aside and stormed after Christina.


"Brendon!" Katie's voice cracked behind him, raw with disbelief. "How can you do this to Yolanda?"


He halted mid-step, his shoulders tense. Slowly,he turned, his gaze frostbitten. "Say one word to Yolanda,and your credit card's gone."


Then, with a sharp breath, he added, "There's nothing going on between me and Christina.I just need answers. That's all."


Before Katie could counter, Brendon turned on his heel and marched out, fury radiating from every
step. But as he burst through the hospital doors,the cold air hit him-and so did reality. He caught only a glimpse of Christina sliding into the backseat of a sleek black luxury car. It wasn't her car. And she didn't look back.


Brendon's temple pounded as he unlocked his phone, his fingers moving with tense precision.

pulled up a photo-one he hadn't wanted to le sit. It showed a black luxury car. The exact make and model of the one Christina had just disappeared into. "Damn it!" he hissed, jaw tight,voice barely above a growl.


He had tried-really tried-to give Christina the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he'd misread the signs. Maybe he had misunderstood her. But the evidence stared back at him, cold and damning.It appeared Christina had been lying to him the entire time. The irony stung. Christina had fallen so far from grace, yet had still found the nerve to accuse Katie.


"Fine," Brendon muttered bitterly, his teeth clenched so tightly that they ached. "I was a damn fool, Christina. Too stupid to see through your act."


Rage swelled inside him, raw and untamed. He stormed toward a tree nearby, needing an outlet-
something, anything-to release the fury building in his chest. He aimed a kick-but in his haste, his foot slipped on the damp ground. His leg shot out awkwardly, and the next thing he knew, the earth rose up and slammed into him. Pain exploded through his back. For a moment, he couldn't even breathe.①


Katie had just stepped out of the hospital when caught sight of him sprawled on the grass."biendon!" she cried out, racing to his side, panic rising in her voice. "Brendon,are you okay?"


"I'm... I am fine," he gasped, even as his face contorted in agony. He tried to sit up, but his vision spun and darkened at the edges.


Katie hovered beside him, furious and frightened."Did that awful woman do something to you?"


"No," he muttered, eyes half-shut, voice faint. "I just slipped."


Then, Katie's breath caught in her throat. "Oh my God-Brendon!"


He looked at her, annoyed. "What now? Why are you freaking out?"


"Brendon-your hand!" Katie gasped, her voice trembling. "It's covered in blood!"
Startled, Brendon glanced down, his stomach twisting at the sight. A slow wave of panic rose in his chest. He reached behind his head and winced as his fingers met the sticky warmth of blood. "Get me inside-now!" he said sharply, fear lacing his voice for the first time.


Katie sprang into action, slipping her arm around him to keep him steady. Her thoughts raced-N if it was serious? What if he collapsed right here? What would that leave the Dawson family?


As they staggered back toward the hospital doors, Brendon pulled out his phone.


"Are you calling Yolanda?" Katie asked,breathless."Let me do it."


"No," he said coldly, already tapping in a number.But it was Christina's number.


Katie's eyes narrowed as she caught the name on the screen. "Christina? You're calling that bitch now?"


"Watch your mouth," Brendon snapped, his tone icy as he cut her a glare.


Katie clamped her lips shut, but fury simmered behind her eyes. Still, some part of her wanted to see-would Christina even care? Would she
bother picking up?


The call rang out. No answer. Brendon's frown deepened. He tried again. And again. Three times. Still nothing. Was Christina too busy cozying up to the man in the black car to answer?His ex-wife, whom he had never so much as made out with, was now with another man. What rig 'id anyone else have to claim her? It seemed Katie had been right all along. Christina was a chameleon, switching masks and lovers with every twist of fortune.


Rage surged through Brendon, blinding and consuming. Then-darkness. His knees buckled.The world spun. And he crumpled to the ground,unconscious, blood still trickling down the back of his neck.


"Brendon!" Katie cried out as his body slumped against hers, far too heavy for her to hold up.


Panicked but determined, she let herself fall with him, bracing the impact as best she could,desperate to shield him from further harm.


They were lucky-already on hospital grounds.A few nurses spotted the commotion and sprang into action, shouting for assistance as a stretcher was rushed in.
In a blur of movement, Brendon was lifted onto it and wheeled through the ER doors, fading from view.


Katie, trembling and breathless, fumbled for her phone. Her fingers barely obeyed her as she dialed. The moment the line connected, she burst out. "Yolanda! Get to the hospital-Brendon coll~'sed!"


"What?" Yolanda's voice tightened, but only just."What happened?"


"He hit his head and passed out. He's in the emergency room now," Katie explained, her voice cracking under the weight of the moment.


"Is it serious? How did it happen?" Yolanda asked,her words quick-but her expression remained calm.



At that exact moment, Yolanda lounged on a velvet sofa, her legs stretched elegantly across a silk throw, a half-empty glass of wine poised at her lips. Her brows furrowed just enough to show concern. On the surface, she sounded worried.But beneath that polished mask, there was only calculation. If Brendon's condition turned grim-if he lost his mobility or mind-she wouldn't grieve.She wouldn't even hesitate. She'd vanish without
###Chapter 43 Escorted To His Place
"Yolanda,you need to get here now! Brendon is seriously wounded!" Katie's voice crackled with panic on the phone.


"Alright. Which hospital?" Yolanda asked, cool and composed. "I'll be there shortly."


After jotting down the address, Yolanda ended the call. Her face remained expressionless as she crossed one leg over the other and took a slow sip of red wine. "What a nuisance," she muttered,irritation creeping into her voice as she rose from the plush couch.


If Brendon weren't her only lifeline right now, she wouldn't have bothered to check on him.Still,she needed to see for herself how serious his condition was. If things had taken a turn for the worse, it could throw everything off track.






Meanwhile, Christina sat alone in the backseat of a sleek black car, the interior silent except for the hum of the engine. "Did Mr. Scott say what this was about?" she asked the driver calmly.
、C1000J
"Mr. Scott didn't mention anything," the driver replied with practiced politeness. "He only instructed me to bring you over. He'll join you once he's done with work."


"I see," Christina said softly, closing her eyes and leaning back to rest. Her phone, set to silent,lay untouched beside her. She hadn't noticed Brendon's repeated calls.


The car eventually rolled to a stop in front of an elegant estate.


Christina opened her eyes just as the driver stepped out and opened the door with courteous precision.


"Miss Jones, we've arrived," the driver said with a respectful nod.


"Thank you," she replied, stepping out into the warm evening air.


Christina was ushered into the mansion, where a servant immediately approached her.


"Would you care for some coffee or juice, Miss Jones?" the servant asked, her voice soft but formal.
"Coffee would be nice. I'm not picky-whatever's available is fine," Christina answered.


"Right away," the servant said, bowing before walking off.


As Christina glanced around the elegant interior,she couldn't help but notice the staff's demeanor.Every movement was polished, every word measured. The Scott family clearly ran a well-disciplined household.


A few minutes later, the servant returned with a porcelain cup on a silver tray. "Please enjoy," she said, placing it gently on the table before stepping back.


Christina took a sip, savoring the warmth, and then looked up. "This place... It belongs to Dylan,doesn't it?"


The servant nodded, gaze lowered."Yes."


"Did he say when he'd be arriving?" Christina asked, her tone calm but curious.


"No," the servant replied, hands neatly folded in front of her. "Mr. Scott only instructed us to ensure you're well taken care of."
Christina gave a courteous nod. "Thank you.That'll be all for now-you may continue with your work."


"Of course. If you need anything at all, please don't hesitate to ask," the servant responded with quiet professionalism.


"I appreciate it," Christina said warmly.


"This is our responsibility. Please enjoy your coffee," the servant remarked, retreating with graceful steps before turning and leaving the room.


Christina leaned back in her seat, quietly impressed by how seamlessly the staff carried themselves. Their poise, precision, and training spoke volumes about the Scott family's standards. There was no doubt-the Scotts were powerful,wealthy, and deeply rooted in tradition.


She couldn't help but wonder-if the Scott family's operations were this tightly controlled,what must their traditions and expectations be like behind closed doors? Anyone marrying into a family like the Scotts would likely have to abide by strict etiquette, hidden rules, and unspoken obligations.
To outsiders, marrying into the Scott family might look like a fairy tale-luxury, power, prestige.But beneath the surface? Sacrifices. Silence. And a life that might never feel like her own.


Taking another slow sip of her coffee, Christina let the warmth settle. It was rich and smooth, the flavor lingering delicately on her tongue.Undoubtedly, it was one of the best cups she'd had in a while.


She beamed. Divorce had given her more than freedom-it had given her clarity. She had no regrets about walking away from marriage and had no desire to walk back into one, especially not into a gilded cage like the Scott family.


Anyway, she had carved her own path. She had wealth, reputation, and independence. She didn't need anyone's name or status to validate her place in the world.


Yet, there were still those who whispered behind her back, thinking she was just another woman trying to marry rich, clawing her way up from the bottom. The thought made her lips curl into a faint,amused smile. If only they knew.
###Chapter 44 She'd Rather Destroy Him
Christina took a sip of her coffee, the warmth grounding her as she waited in silence. But as the minutes ticked by, boredom slowly crept in. She reached for her phone to distract herself.


That was when she finally noticed the three missed calls from Brendon. At first, she didn't feel like calling back. The thought of hearing his voice again brought more irritation than concern. But then, a flicker of worry surfaced. What if he had called because something had happened to Bethel?


With a reluctant sigh, she hesitated, thumb hovering over the screen. After a moment of indecision, she tapped the call button.


The line connected-then immediately dropped.


Christina frowned and tried again. It was immediately hung up.


A third attempt. Still the same.


Annoyance mixed with unease. Clearly,something wasn't right. Instead of calling again,she opened her messages and typed quickly.
"Why aren't you answering? You called me earlier -was it urgent? Is Bethel alright?"


A few moments later, a reply came through."Nothing's wrong. Stop pestering me. I'm busy and don't have time for you."


Christina stared at the screen, incredulous. Then,she laughed-sharp, exasperated, almost amused. Unbelievable. She quickly typed back."Have you lost it? You're the one who called me first. If anyone's being a nuisance, it's definitely not me."


No reply followed.



Christina smirked, assuming Brendon had no comeback.


But the truth was far different. Brendon was still in the emergency room, unconscious, and his phone was now in Yolanda's possession.


A sudden commotion broke the silence, making Yolanda flinch. Relief flooded her when she saw it wasn't Katie returning. She quickly deleted Christina's message and wiped the call log,erasing any trace of the exchange.


Yolanda stared at the screen, jaw clenched, teeth grinding. Three calls. Brendon had called
Christina three times before he passed out. Even in a moment of crisis, the first person he had thought of was Christina. If Katie hadn't phoned,she might've stayed in the dark until morning.That thought stung deeper than she expected.


Panic seized Yolanda. Brendon had changed. He wasn't the same man who used to think of her first. And Christina had clearly left her mark on Brendon's heart. Her three years of quiet devotion had etched something permanent into his heart.


Yolanda's hands curled into tight fists. No. She wouldn't allow this to happen. She wouldn't let Brendon slip away-not to Christina, not to anyone. Until the day she chose to discard him,Brendon would remain hers. His body, his heart-both belonged to her. And she wasn't about to give them up. Christina clearly hadn't backed off.She must still be plotting something-trying to worm her way back into Brendon's life. That woman had no shame. How dare Christina try to seduce Brendon right under her nose? It was downright delusional.


Yolanda's grip tightened around the phone,knuckles pale, her jaw clenching so hard that it sent a jolt of pain through her temples. Even if
she no I0N9EI VVAIILEU DICIUUI,N let Christina have him. She would rather destroy him than let him end up in Christina's arms.






Meanwhile, at the mansion, the quiet of the hallway was broken by the sound of approaching footsteps,which caught Christina's attention.


She turned just as Dylan stepped into view-tall,composed, radiating a cold and commanding presence. Beside him walked a young man in gold-rimmed glasses, exuding a quiet sophistication.


The young man was undeniably attractive in his own right-refined, poised, almost scholarly in demeanor. But next to Dylan, the contrast was striking.


Where Dylan carried the weight of silent authority,with eyes sharp as steel and a presence that demanded attention, the young man was calm and gracious-more gentleman than force.


"Apologies for the delay," Dylan said as he approached.


Christina rose from her seat with a smile. "Not at all. I just arrived myself." Her eyes flicked toward
the young man. "And this is..."


There was a curious warmth in her tone as she regarded the young man, her expression open,friendly-perhaps even a little intrigued.


Dylan noticed her reaction and felt a flicker of annoyance. He hadn't expected her to pay so much attention to Morse Hampton, a psychiatrist he invited over for her. Suddenly, bringing Morse along seemed like a terrible idea. His expression darkened, a cold edge creeping into his demeanor, sharp enough to chill the air around him.


"I'm Morse Hampton," he said with a confident smile, stepping forward and offering his hand.


Dylan watched the exchange, an unexpected wave of irritation and jealousy tightening in his chest.
###Chapter 45 Christina's Secretive Identity
Dylan moved instantly, seizing Morse's hand in a firm, commanding grip before Morse could shake hands with Christina-just enough to make his authority crystal clear.


"Take a seat. We'lI discuss this calmly," he said.


Morse registered the force in Dylan's handshake,his curiosity deepening at Dylan's unusually tense manner. Something about the woman at the center of all this had clearly rattled Dylan.


Morse was mildly intrigued. Having been friends with Dylan for years, this marked the first time Dylan had personally requested his services as a psychiatrist. For a woman, no less. It signaled something out of the ordinary. This wasn't just another patient. There was a hidden story here.


Unaware of the charged silence between the two men, Christina stepped forward with an easy confidence. "I am Christina Jones. It's a pleasure to meet you."

Dylan's features stayed carved in stone.
Gesturing toward Morse, he offered a brief,cold explanation, saying, "He's a psychiatrist. One of the best around. I brought him here for you."


Her surprise was evident. "A psychiatrist? For me? That's... I don't really think it's necessary."


Most people might have welcomed the suggestion, but Christina saw no need. After all,in the secretive underworld, she had earned her reputation as the most formidable assassin alive-her name whispered with fear and awe among mercenaries everywhere. Despite her legend, no one had ever discovered who she really was. All anyone could say was that she never failed-a perfect record with every assignment completed,no exceptions. Her missions bordered on the impossible, yet she tackled each one with unmatched precision and calm.


From continent to continent, her legend had grown, and she had become the subject of awe among a hidden legion of admirers. Should her true identity ever come to light, the resulting frenzy wouldn't just electrify her followers-it would ripple through the world itself.


Inevitably, envy followed fame. An exposure of her identity would undoubtedly draw every rival assassin, each one hungry to take her down for
the title of the world's best. After all, toppling a legend is the quickest way to become one.


The y Christina deflected the idea of therapy only iforced what Dylan and Morse suspected:her mind had likely built walls to keep her from reliving the blood-soaked memories of her past.


A silent exchange passed between the two men,their brows furrowing slightly. In their mind,whatever facade Christina presented, her emotional state must be anything but ordinary.It seemed as though she'd locked away all her pain and fear,unable-or unwilling-to let herself feel.


"He's here now. Humor him, will you?" Dylan's tone gentled, a rare hint of persuasion coloring his words. "You two just chat for a bit. If it gets to be too much, we'll stop right away..."


"Yeah, I made the trip. You wouldn't want to break my heart by rejecting me, would you?" Morse chimed in, hoping to lift the tension a little.


That finally drew a laugh from Christina. She decided there was no harm in humoring them-she'd sit through the session, at least for now.Otherwise, it wouldn't take long before these two sharp-eyed men started unraveling the discreet identities she'd worked so hard to bury.
Her acting talents kicked in, she let out a small,hesitant sigh. "Honestly, I just feel bad that Dylan has rescued me, and now here I am, troubling you both with my problems."


"It's no t ole at all. You've helped me so much.It's only right that I take good care of you." Dylan met her gaze, his voice steady, his face unreadable.


Morse chimed in with easy warmth, "What matters is that you're okay. You were a huge part of Chloe's recovery-helping you now is the least I can do."


Christina glanced down, her lashes fluttering as tears gathered in her eyes, her acting purposely exaggerated. "Thank you, truly. You've both shown me more kindness than I deserve."


Seeing the sudden shimmer in her eyes, Dylan felt a strange, tight ache in his chest-something he couldn't quite explain.


To change the mood, Morse leaned in with a grin."Miss Jones, I've heard you're a crack shot. How about a friendly shooting match someday?"


That did the trick-Christina's spirits perked up."Deal! But if I miss, you're not allowed to tease me"
"Why would I tease you?" Morse replied,chuckling. "Since you can outshoot Dylan, you've already got more skill than I'll ever have." He threw in a wink. "Besides, even if you miss, I bet you'd still win against me."


"well, I've seen some surprises on the range L ore." A wide grin split Christina's face.


Their conversation drifted on for a while, laughter cutting through the earlier tension, until Christina rose and followed Morse into the study to begin her session.



Restlessly, Dylan paced the hallway outside the study, feeling as if every minute stretched into an eternity. Had it not been for the rule that therapy should be private, he would have charged in long before.


Images of Christina, pale and petrified in the aftermath of that grisly scene, haunted Dylan with every step. The memory left his chest aching for reasons he couldn't quite name. He had no doubt that the horror she'd witnessed had rattled her to the core.



The ticking clock only made Dylan's nerves worse, and impatience gnawed at him as he waited.Just as he considered knocking, the study
door swung open unexpectedly. He found himself face-to-face with Christina. Red-rimmed eyes and puffy lids told the whole story-she'd been crying.


A sharp ache sliced through Dylan's heart, his frown deepening with worry. Tears from a single session? That didn't sit right with him. His voice dropped to a wintry chill as he pinned Morse with a glare. "What happened in there?"


Morse, unruffled but keenly aware of Dylan's hostility, answered evenly, "Sometimes, feelings have to come out. With regular sessions, she'll be back to herself in a few months."



A storm brewed behind Dylan's eyes. Morse could practically feel the fury simmering beneath the surface. Never had he seen anyone so emotionally rattled-Dylan looked ready to tear the world apart for her.
###Chapter 46 Get To Enjoy His Dishes
"Thank you, Dr. Hampton..." Christina nodded with red eyes, but her heart remained completely calm. She even felt like laughing at the absurdity of the situation. Still, she forced herself to put on an act. If she slipped, these two sharp-eyed men would catch on instantly.


Dylan's voice grew gentler, his frosty demeanor melting just a touch. "Make sure you don't skip your regular therapy sessions. I can drive you when the time comes."


Christina's voice rasped as she replied, "That's really not necessary. I wouldn't want to trouble you. Just give me the address and I'll manage to get to Dr. Hampton on my own."


Dylan's expression cooled, the softness vanishing. Before he could say something,Morse jumped ahead, wearing a broad, easy grin. "No trouble at all! How could it possibly be trouble? lf you were coming to see me, you'd need to make an appointment in advance. But if I come to you,it's much more convenient for everyone, isn't it?"


Morse knew better than to agree to the idea that
Christina came to him for therapy sessions. With Dylan's budding feelings toward her, he knew if he slipped his work address, he'd probably pay dearly for it.


Christina offered a faint smile. "Alright then, I'll leave it to you. Sorry for putting you out."


Since Morse had put it that way, she figured arguing further was pointless.


"No trouble at all," Dylan stated curtly.


Morse's gaze bounced between Dylan and Christina, a knowing smirk tugging at his lips. "So,what's the plan? Miss Jones, do you need a ride home to get some rest, or..."


Christina shifted awkwardly, a faint flush rising to her cheeks. "I'll just grab a cab. I can't keep imposing on you."


"It's really no trouble. I was leaving anyway-it's right on my way," Dylan said, his face expressionless, though the words were a blatant lie.


She hesitated, clearly unconvinced, but after a moment, she relented with a soft nod.


Just as the three turned to go, an embarrassingly loud rumble erupted from Christina's stomach.
Morse grinned, his eyes lighting up with mischief."Hungry, Miss Jones? How about we make Dylan treat us to a meal?"


Christina's smile was warm, her embarrassment fading. "Let me treat you both instead. What do you feel like eating?"


Morse threw his hands up in mock protest,laughter bubbling in his chest. "Absolutely not!You don't need to worry about Dylan's wallet-he could never spend it all! But if you're really reluctant to spend his money, you can spend mine instead."


Christina let out a bright, musical laugh, her eyes narrowing into delighted crescents that shimmered with genuine happiness.


Her laughter was infectious, and her effortless beauty seemed to radiate from her every gesture,making it impossible to look away.


Morse stood there, mesmerized for a few seconds, before Dylan's icy gaze snapped him out of his daze.


Trying to cut through the tension with a bit of bravado, Morse adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses and shot Dylan a lopsided, mischievous grin. "So,what's the plan? Are you treating us or what?"
Ignoring Morse's antics, Dylan turned his attention to Christina. The sharpness in his eyes faded, replaced by a rare gentleness. "Let's just stay in. I'll cook. Is there anything you can't eat, or anything you're craving?" His voice was unusually soft.


While Christina took his offer in stride, Morse could hardly believe his ears. What on earth was going on today? Was he dreaming? Dylan was actually volunteering to cook? In all the years they'd known each other, he could count on one hand the number of times Dylan had personally made a meal for someone. And now, here Dylan was, offering to whip something up for Christina.The implication was glaringly obvious-she was someone special.


With that realization, Morse's gaze flicked to Christina, his eyes filling with fresh curiosity and genuine admiration. How had she managed to thaw even a corner of Dylan's permafrost heart?


Right now, though, Morse mostly felt like celebrating his own good fortune. Coming over for Christina's therapy had landed him the golden ticket: a chance to savor Dylan's cooking skills.


A fizz of anticipation shot through Morse-only for Christina to cut in. "That's too much trouble.
Let's just eat out. My treat. Order anything you like."


Morse's excitement fizzled in an instant. What was the point of a restaurant meal when Dylan's home cooking was on the table?


Still, Morse kept his disappointment to himself,knowing that if he complained, Dylan might shut down the offer entirely.

Dylan replied, "Seriously, it's no trouble. I'll whip up a few quick dishes. It won't take long."


In truth, Christina was tempted. She was already starving, and her stomach rumbled at the mere thought of Dylan's cooking. But she hated to impose, which was why she'd suggested a restaurant in the first place. But now, seeing Dylan's insistence, she realized he might be eager to impress-how could she refuse him that?"Okay then. Let me help out in the kitchen," she replied with an easy smile.


"I'll help too!" Morse blurted out, thrusting his hand in the air.


Before anyone could protest, Morse bolted for the kitchen, practically tripping over himself in his eagerness. Panic flickered across his face-if Dylan changed his mind, this rare treat would
vanish in a heartbeat.


The more Morse thought about the prospect of tasting Dylan's dishes, the brighter his mood became. He couldn't help but beam, a goofy grin plastered across his face as he started humming an off-key, happy tune.


Christina blinked, momentarily stunned by Morse's sudden burst of enthusiasm. She watched him disappear at breakneck speed,barely processing what had just happened.


"Sometimes, he can be a bit much..." Dylan trailed off.



Christina let out a soft laugh. "He seems like a blast."


Dylan's expression cooled once more, a shadow of irritation passing over his face. "Yeah. You could say that," he replied tersely.


He then asked, "So, what do you want to eat? Any cravings?"


Christina's lips curved in a gentle smile. "I'm easy to please-anything's fine,really."


Dylan wasted no time, launching into a rapid-fire list of dish options as if reciting a restaurant menu, gesturing for her to choose whichever
ones appealed to her.


Christina hesitated, the sheer number of choices making her mouth water. "Are you sure this isn't too much work? And, um, do you two even like spicy food?"


"We can handle it," Dylan replied without hesitation.



As they started prepping ingredients, Morse peered over Christina's shoulder. "All those chilies?"


Morse eyed the pile with clear suspicion. When did Dylan ever go for spicy dishes?


Before he could press Dylan for answers,Christina chimed in with a grin, "How about you?Are you good with spicy food?"


"Of course | am! It's just..." Morse's voice faltered as Dylan shot him a warning glare. He clamped his mouth shut, thinking better of finishing his sentence.


Christina arched an eyebrow, genuinely curious."Just what?"
###Chapter 47 Teasing
A relaxed grin spread across Morse's face."Dylan and I just can't handle food that's too spicy."


Christina turned to Dylan, her tone light and easy."Let's cut back on the chilies, then. I've been a little under the weather lately-can't handle anything too fiery."

She tossed out the excuse with a small smile,smoothing things over without making a fuss.


Dylan simply nodded in agreement. "Alright."


A short while later, platters of steaming dishes filled the table, the air fragrant with spices and simmered broth.


Morse, who'd been eyeing the spicy beef stew for ages, finally gave in to temptation. The aroma had been torturing him for minutes, each inhale making his stomach rumble louder. At last, he loaded his plate, unable to hide his eagerness.The first bite of beef practically melted in his mouth,tender and bursting with rich, balanced flavor. Every mouthful confirmed it-Dylan's cooking belonged in a league of its own.
Just as Morse reached for a second helping,he slapped his forehead. "Oh, wait! I forgot to take any pictures!"


He scrambled for his phone, snapping photos from every angle with the enthusiasm of a food blogger on deadline. But the lure of the food was too much. Instead of uploading the photos right away,he put the phone aside and dove right back in.


Christina glanced up, a gentle curiosity in her eyes. "How's the spice level? Is it alright for you?"


"It's amazing," Morse muttered, barely pausing between bites as he shoveled more food onto his plate.


His gold-rimmed glasses slid dangerously close to the tip of his nose, but he ignored them, laser-focused on devouring every flavorful bite.


Dylan sat across from him, posture straight and face unreadable. The heat from the chilies clearly hit him harder than he let on, but he didn't flinch.Maintaining a steady tone, he simply said, "It's fine."


Morse was on the verge of losing it--he had to bite back a laugh at the sight of Dylan toughing it out for Christina's sake. Honestly,watching Dylan
power through the spice just to impress her was something else.One thing was for sure. Christina wasn't just anyone to Dylan.


Morse could see it clear as day-Dylan was already falling for Christina. But whether that would lead to anything real... Well, that was anyone's guess. It all came down to whether Dylan could step up.


For a moment, the table quieted, filled only with the gentle clinking of cutlery and the warm,savory scents wafting between them. Suddenly,Morse couldn't help himself. "So, Miss Jones,what do you think of Dylan? Ever thought about being with him?" he blurted, a teasing spark lighting his eyes.


The question hit Christina mid-bite. She coughed violently, scrambling for a napkin as she tried to recover her composure.


Dylan's eyes sharpened, and he quickly passed her a napkin, his glare pinning Morse with a silent warning.

Morse sprang from his seat, hands raised in apology. "Sorry! I'm so sorry, Miss Jones. Are you alright?"


Christina waved him off between coughs, her
face flushing. "I'm fine," she replied, forcing a quick smile. "I just ate too fast... And the chili caught me off guard."


There was no way she'd admit that Morse's ambush of a question had been the real culprit.


"My bad, just kidding around," Morse stated,flashing a sheepish grin as he scratched the back of his neck.


Christina returned a polite smile. "Don't worry,I understand."


"But honestly, Dylan's the real deal," Morse added,eyes twinkling with mischief.


"Mr. Scott is quite remarkable," Christina replied with a lilting laugh. "I can see why he'd attract plenty of admirers."


Morse leaned closer, his gaze suddenly shrewd."What about you,though?"


"Me?" Christina turned to glance at Dylan, her lips curving into a teasing smile. "If Mr. Scott dropped to one knee and proposed right now, I'd have to say yes on the spot."


Morse seized the moment with dramatic flair."Hear that, Dylan? Now's your chance! No ring?Use your property deed! The Scott family estate
will work just fine-"


Dylan cut him off, his tone like ice. "Enough. Stop dragging everyone into your jokes. It's getting awkward."


Dylan saw right through Christina's breezy answer. The more casually she brushed it off, the clearer it was that she had no real interest.


Morse snorted, eyebrows raised. "Awkward?Who's awkward?" He glanced at Christina,searching her face."Are you?"


Christina just smiled, a relaxed warmth in her eyes. "Not at all. We're just goofing around."


"See? Exactly!" Morse grinned, undeterred. "I'm just keeping the mood light."


Morse inwardly exhaled. Despite his best efforts to spice things up, Dylan didn't seize the moment.


The meal soon wrapped up, and Morse pushed his empty plate away, sinking back in his chair with a contented sigh, stuffed to the brim.


Only after scraping his plate clean did he finally upload the photos he'd taken earlier, proudly captioning them, "This is what top-tier indulgence looks like. Luckiest day ever!"
Within moments, his post exploded with likes and comments.


Ralphy was the fastest to comment. "It's just a few homemade dishes. What's so special about that? I'm at Morfort Restaurant right now! Just wait. I'll post my photos and show you what real fine dining is!"


Morse fired back, oozing smug satisfaction."Morfort Restaurant? Please. I just had a private meal cooked by Dylan himself. Beat that."


Meanwhile, over at Morfort Restaurant, Ralphy was still waiting on his order when Morse's reply popped up on his screen. He nearly dropped his phone in shock. What the hell? Dylan actually cooked?


Without hesitation, Ralphy launched a video call,urgency lacing his tone. "Wait-are you actually at Dylan's place right now?"


"Of course," Morse replied, sinking back into his chair with a smug grin. He slid his gold-rimmed glasses up the bridge of his nose, the picture of self-satisfaction.


"I'm coming over right now!" Ralphy exclaimed,barely pausing to snatch up his suit jacket as he bolted from his seat.
In that moment, the extravagant meal he'd ordered at Morfort Restaurant was completely forgotten. All he could think about was the chance to taste Dylan's legendary home cooking.Chloe's mention of the onion soup still echoed in his mind-he'd missed out, and the regret stung.This time, he refused to let the opportunity slip away.


"There's really no need. We finished everything already," Morse declared, his grin stretching even wider.


Ralphy paused dead, shooting daggers at Morse via the video call.


Unable to help himself, Morse burst out laughing."You're supposed to be the heir to the Graham family. Try showcasing more poise like most expected from a future family lead..."


Ralphy bristled. "You've got a lot of nerve! Why didn't you say anything sooner?"



Morse's laughter only grew, while Ralphy clenched his jaw in frustration.


"Morse, I swear, I'll get you back for this!" Ralphy growled, his voice trembling with barely controlled fury.
###Chapter 48 Christina Is Definitely Not An Ordinary Woman
Morse dropped his voice, speaking in a hushed whisper into the phone. "I've figured out a trick to get Dylan to cook."


Ralphy shot to his feet, his emotions flaring again."Really? What trick? Tell me right now!"


"Oh? Didn't you say you would get back at me for not messaging you about Dylan's cooking just a minute ago?" Morse's lips curled in a sly,triumphant grin.


Immediately, Ralphy's whole demeanor shifted-he flashed a wide, obsequious smile. "I was just kidding! I swear, I didn't mean any of that..."


Morse arched an eyebrow and flashed a teasing smile. "So what does that make me,then?"


Ralphy's eyes darted before he plastered on an eager grin. "You're my boss. Whatever you say goes, all right? I'll do anything-just tell me the trick!"


To Ralphy, losing a touch of pride was a small sacrifice for the meal made by Dylan with his own
hands.Learning what it took to get Dylan to cook was priceless.


"Boss, please, what's the secret?" Ralphy pleaded, grinning shamelessly.


Morse burst out laughing at Ralphy's pathetic display. "Are you really willing to do anything lask just for a shot at Dylan's cooking?"


"Absolutely! Name it, I'll do it! Now quit stalling and tell me already!" Ralphy bounced on his heels, nearly bursting with anticipation.


Morse leaned in, smirking. "Well, since you're so eager... Let's talk about your family's assets for a second..."


Before he could finish, Ralphy jumped in with an eager shout. "Boss! Everything I have is yours-take it all!"


But Ralphy barely got the words out before a cane came crashing down across his back.


"Ah! Ow-hey!" A sharp yelp escaped Ralphy as pain shot up his back. He whipped around, face blazing with anger. "Who the hell just hit me? Are you looking to die?"


But as soon as Ralphy caught sight of the culprit,his bravado collapsed. The words tangled in his
throat. His voice went small and uncertain."Grandpa..." He summoned up a nervous grin,trying to play it cool. "Uh, what brings you here all of a sudden?"


Samuel Graham, Ralphy's grandfather, scowled,digging his cane into the floor. "If I hadn't shown up, you'd have handed over the entire family to someone else!"


Ralphy let out a weak, awkward chuckle,desperate to defuse the situation. "Come on, I was just kidding..."


Samuel's scowl only deepened. He raised his cane again,threatening another whack.


Panicking, Ralphy blurted out, "Dylan's cooked today!"


The words stopped Samuel mid-swing."What the hell did you just say? Dylan's cooked today?" he echoed,his irritation momentarily forgotten.


Ralphy bobbed his head up and down, scrambling to keep the peace."Yeah!l-"


Samuel didn't let Ralphy finish. In a flash, he snatched Ralphy's phone and shoved Ralphy out of the way. "Out of my way!"


Ralphy stumbled back, barely catching himself as
Samuel claimed his phone.


Samuel's tone flipped to warmth as he addressed the screen, "Morse, have you guys finished washing the dishes over there?"


Momentarily startled, Morse responded, "Mr.Graham,all the dishes are washed and put away."


Samuel's expression shifted, smoothing into an ingratiating smile. "Morse, you know l've always treated you well, haven'tl?"


"Of course, Mr. Graham. You've always been very generous," Morse replied, his fingers pushing up his gold-rimmed glasses. He could already tell where this conversation was headed.


Right on cue, Samuel leaned in closer to the screen.


"About that trick you mentioned earlier...Would you mind sharing it with me?" His smile stretched even wider, thick with expectation.


By this time, Ralphy had recovered from his shock and was hovering nearby, craning his neck to catch every word.


With a sly grin, Morse quietly toggled his phone camera from the front to the rear lens, panning around the room before letting the frame settle
on the living room.


In the shot, two people sat comfortably, sipping coffee.Dylan lounged in an armchair, his features locked in a cold, unreadable mask. Beside him sat a young woman, poised and composed, her face entirely unfamiliar to Samuel.


Samuel's eyes narrowed with intrigue. "Who's that woman over there? She's just sitting there having coffee with Dylan?"


For a moment, genuine surprise flickered across Samuel's normally unflappable face. He leaned in,peering at the screen, silently sizing up the woman with growing interest. Someone who could sit so naturally across from Dylan-unfazed,perfectly at ease-had to be remarkable.


"I know!" Ralphy couldn't contain himself.He shot his hand into the air, practically bouncing in his seat. "Grandpa, that's Christina! I've told you about her-she's the one who beat Dylan and won the prize of King's treatment. She struck a deal with Dylan, and now, thanks to her,Chloe actually has a shot at being healed."


Samuel's keen eyes stayed locked on Christina,sizing her up with the practiced scrutiny of a man who missed nothing. He took note of the way she
sat-poised, unafraid, utterly unfazed by Dylan's presence. Clearly, she wasn't someone ordinary.



A slow realization dawned on Samuel. Any woman who could best Dylan in a shooting competition wasn't just impressive-she was exceptional.
###Chapter 49 Useless
Samuel regarded Christina with a gleam of admiration in his eyes, the corners of his mouth lifting into a rare, gentle smile. In that moment, he couldn't help but think-the Scott bloodline outshined the Grahams by miles. Such clarity.Such instinct.



The contrast between Ralphy and Dylan made Samuel's blood boil. The comparison wasn't even close. With a grunt of frustration, he shoved the phone back into Ralphy's hand. Ralphy's career was already inferior to Dylan's, and now, Dylan showcased better tasté in choosing partners.


"You useless rascal!" Samuel thundered at Ralphy, pacing with agitation.


"Grandpa, please!" Ralphy said quickly, trying to pacify him. "Let's not lose sight of the goal-the secret trick. That's what matters."



But Samuel wasn't listening. His expression hardened as he turned on his heel and strode away,seething.
Then, from the phone's speaker, Morse's laughter echoed mockingly.


"How dare you laugh at a time like this!" Ralphy snapped, his eyes flashing with irritation.


"Your grandfather's something else," Morse said,amusement lacing every word.


Ralphy frowned. He still didn't get it that Christina wasn't just a name in passing-she was the axis on which everything turned. But to him, the conversation between his grandpa and Morse was a cipher, each word more perplexing than the last.



"I'm ending the call," Morse said, smirking faintly."| have to take Miss Jones home."


Ralphy blurted out, "Wait-what about the secret trick? At least give me a hint!"


"Miss Jones needs to be taken home," Morse said coolly."We'll talk later."


And with that, the screen went dark. Ralphy stared at the phone for a beat, stunned. Then,slowly, realization dawned-and hit him like a lightning bolt. Christina wasn't just important-she was the key. His expression shifted from
bafflement to glee. From this moment forward, he vowed to treat Christina like royalty-ride her coattails, sing her praises, and sponge off Dylan's hospitality.



With a self-satisfied smirk, Ralphy whispered to himself, "Miss Jones, looks like I'll be relying on you from now on."


The next morning, Christina shuffled out of bed,bleary-eyed and sluggish. Still half-asleep, she fumbled through her morning routine, brushing her teeth with her eyes closed, swaying slightly like a drunk sailor adrift.


The hangover hadn't worn off yet. Davina had shown up last night with a bottle of something strong, and the two of them had gone a few rounds deeper than planned.


Even now, Christina felt like her head was wrapped in cotton.


Suddenly, there was a ruckus outside.


Her senses sharpened in an instant. Could it be Davina coming over again? Clutching her toothbrush, still clad in her cozy bear-print pajamas, she padded toward the front door.
"Oh! This one's just perfect! A full sea-view estate! Absolutely ideal for this season-so cozy and tranquil!"



Christina froze mid-step. That voice. Definitely not Davina. Her brow furrowed sharply. She knew that chirpy, fake-sweet tone anywhere. Joselyn.What the hell was Joselyn doing here? And Joselyn wasn't alone. Judging by the background chatter, she had company. Was Joselyn talking about renting this place?



Christina's eyes narrowed. This estate was a part of the divorce settlement with Brendon!


"Oh, any place will do, as long as Brendon and Yolanda are happy," said Sheila Mitchell,Yolanda's mother, her tone warm and polite.



"I promise you, once Yolanda marries into our family, we'll treat her just like our own daughter.No different at all," Joselyn remarked, puffing up proudly.


"With your assurance, we can finally breathe easy," said Finnegan Mitchell, Yolanda's father,his tone satisfied. "Now that my father's on board, Yolanda and Brendon can finally be together. It's a happy ending."
Sheila hesitated, her brow creasing slightly. "But...Are Brendon and that woman truly over? There's been no public word about their divorce. I'm still uneasy."


"Mrs. Mitchell, there's no need to worry," Katie interjected smoothly. "The divorce papers are signed and sealed. I've seen them with my own eyes."


Sheila exhaled, visibly relieved. "Thank goodness.I've heard rumors about that woman's private affairs... Not exactly the sort of thing one wants linked to the family."


Finnegan's face darkened. "A woman like that-fickle and disloyal-will never be allowed near the Mitchell name. She's súch a stain."


Katie scoffed, her nose wrinkling with disgust."It's all my grandmother's fault. She went soft and let Christina into our family. Christina brought us nothing but embarrassment! Thank God, Brendon came to his senses and divorced her. She's revolting."



"Katie, maybe Christina had her reasons,"Yolanda said gently, feigning sympathy while expertly twisting the blade. "We don't know the
whole story."


Joselyn patted Yolanda's hand. "You're too kind for your own good, dear. A woman like Christina doesn't deserve your compassion. Kindness like yours can be a liability if someone like her decides to take advantage."


In Joselyn's eyes, Yolanda was the perfect match for her son-elegant, well-bred, poised.Everything Christina was not. Brendon deserved someone like Yolanda.


"She's the reason I don't have a grandchild yet,"Joselyn added bitterly. "She latched onto Brendon like a leech for years and still couldn't bear him a child."



"I see you're having a good time spewing shit out of that vile mouth of yours!" Christina's voice cut through the room like a blade. All heads turned in shock.



Then, Christina looked Joselyn dead in the eye."No matter how capable a woman is, there's only so much she can do if the real problem lies with her husband in terms of having babies."


A smirk danced on Christina's lips as her eyes flicked-mockingly-from Joselyn to Katie.
###Chapter 50 Finnegan Pretends To Be Dead
Finnegan spun to face Joselyn, his voice sharp with disbelief. "Mrs. Dawson, this woman just insulted your son-and you're honestly going to let that go?"


"Christina Jones!" Joselyn hissed, her words trembling with a volatile mix of shame and anger.She jabbed an unsteady finger at Christina, her eyes wild. "You fucking bitch! One more word out of you, and I'll snuff that mouth of yours permanently."


Christina exhaled, the sound thick with mocking exhaustion. "Alas! Guess I really am a hopeless case,huh?"


Katie's lips twisted into a venomous smirk."What's this? Finally smartened up and realized you're just a loser?"


Christina's smile turned languid, almost lazy, her eyes radiating an icy indifference. "I just realized that no matter how hard I fall, I can't even get close to the bottomless pit of shamelessness of you guys. Honestly, I'm impressed. I could never
compete."


Outrage swept through the group, every face twisted with indignation, each of them looking ready to throttle Christina right then and there.


Yolanda pushed forward, her eyes glistening with theatrical misery. "Christina, if you're angry-if you have some grudge-then take it out on me.Please, just leave the Dawson family out of it.I can shoulder it all," she pleaded, her voice trembling as if she might break.


Christina's gaze flicked to Yolanda, cold and contemptuous. She didn't bother with words-a single withering look was enough to send Yolanda reeling back, panic flashing across her face as she nearly toppled over.


Joselyn and Katie hurried to Yolanda's side, their faces knotted with worry as they hovered over her, fussing and whispering anxious questions.


The whole performance was so absurd that Christina nearly let out a laugh. All she'd done was look at Yolanda, yet these women acted as if she'd pulled a knife.


Sheila's voice rang out, cold and shrill. "How could you be so vicious? The Dawson family once welcomed you as one of their own. Is this what
you do-get divorced and start flinging insults?You even insulted your ex-husband! Don't you have a shred of decency left? The Dawsons treated you well, but now you're out here smearing their name just for spite. Showing no respect to your elders-aren't you afraid of what that might bring?"


Christina's gaze, languid and unbothered, slid over to Sheila as she took an unhurried step forward. Sheila immediately shrank back, fear flashing in her eyes for a split second.


For a heartbeat, Sheila felt as if Christina's cool,razor-sharp stare had sliced straight through her,laying bare every secret she'd ever tried to hide.She couldn't breathe-her throat seemed to tighten under that icy scrutiny.


With a slow, crooked smile, Christina spoke,her voice laced with mockery. "Interesting. No wonder you all get along so well-your private lives are just as messy as your gossip."


Sheila's complexion went ghostly pale, but she quickly composed herself, forcing a sneer. "Ha!Stop slandering me. Word is, you're just the Jones family's charity case-some adopte nobody, parents unknown. If anyone here is illegitimate, Christina, it's you."
Finnegan's face turned an ominous shade as he jabbed a finger in Christina's direction, his voice thundering. "What bullshit are you spewing?Every Mitchell child has a paternity report-they're all mine! Keep talking and I'll drag you to court for slander!"


Christina didn't even flinch. "By all means, try it,"she replied aloofly, a sly, mocking smile tugging at her lips. Her gaze cut straight through Finnegan and Sheila, ice-cold and unyielding. "But let's not kid ourselves-at least one of you isn't related to your kids by blood."


Panic flashed across both Finnegan's and Sheila's faces, though Finnegan's temper snapped first.


"You goddamn piece of scum! I'll shut that mouth of yours for good!" Finnegan snapped, storming toward Christina with murder in his eyes.


Yolanda's voice trembled as she called out,"Dad,please-don't get upset!"


But she made no effort to intervene, secretly wishing he'd hurt Christina. If he landed a blow the most they'd have to do was pay some hush money-nothing truly damaging.


Yolanda had always dealt with her victims the same way-crush them and then toss them
scraps. To her, the poor were pitiful creatures, too desperate to chase justice once money entered the picture. In her eyes, poverty itself was a crime -one she had no intention of forgiving.
The onlookers gathered, anticipation flickering in their eyes, waiting for Christina to be humiliated.


But in the split second before Finnegan's foot could land, Christina slipped nimbly aside.


Finnegan's leg whipped through empty air, his own momentum pitching him forward. With a sickening thud, he crashed onto the floor, the room reverberating with the impact. A pained groan slipped from his lips as he lay sprawNled and unmoving.


The group, who moments before looked eager for violence, blanched at the sudden turn.


"Dad!" Yolanda shrieked, bolting to his side,her face drained of color.



Finnegan shifted ever so slightly, and the collective tension in the room broke-their relief as palpable as their shock. He hadn't died from the fall, but the spectacle they'd expected had shattered in the blink of an eye.



Yolanda immediately burst into tears, her sobs
echoing through the room. "Dad! Dad, say something-please, don't scare me like this!"


"Yol..." Finnegan tried to speak, but Yolanda threw him a sharp,warning look-an unspoken cue.


Catching on, Finnegan obediently let his hand flop to the floor, squeezing his eyes shut.


"Dad, answer me! What's wrong with you?"Yolanda wailed, wringing her hands in theatrical distress.


Sheila's voice rang out, shrill and panicked."Darling! Please, don't do this-don't leave me!"


Joselyn rushed over, her tone pitched high with alarm. "Mr.Mitchell! Wake up-please!"


The room erupted into overlapping cries, the chaos sharp enough to rattle the windows.


Katie whipped around, her wrath fixed on Christina. "This is all your fault, Christina! Look what you've done!"


Christina lounged against the wall, arms raised in a lazy stretch. "And what exactly does this have to do with me?" she drawled, unfazed by the hysteria.


"If anything happens to Mr. Mitchell, we'll mane
you pay!" Katie spat, her glare seething with accusation.


Christina met her glare with a faint, dismissive smile. "You're really blaming me? He fell over his own feet-how's that my fault?"


"It's all on you!" Katie bellowed, her voice sharp as a slap. "You have to take full responsibility!"


A quiet chuckle slipped from Christina's lips. "Let me get this straight: you think I should've just stood there and let him try to kick me?"


Christina shot Katie a look, her eyes cool and fearless. That kick had been meant to put her in the hospital,maybe worse.


Katie crossed her arms, refusing to back down. "If you hadn't dodged, would he even have fallen?You're young. It's not like you would die from a kick!"



Christina arched a brow and gave a sly, taunting grin. "If you're so sure, why don't you stand right there and let me kick you to test that theory?"
###Chapter 51 Bet Again
Christina's voice dripped with icy sarcasm. Her tone alone made everyone's blood boil.


Katie practically vibrated with rage. "Enough with that attitude! Apologize properly, pay for the medical bills, and maybe-maybe-we'll let this go.If not..."


Christina tilted her head, her smile cool and effortless. "If not,what? You'll cry louder?"


Katie's eyes blazed. "We'll press charges! You'll be arrested for assault. Hope you enjoy jail food."


Christina widened her eyes in mock fear, clasping her hands to her chest. "Oh no, not that.Please don't call the police... I might be able to heal that old man myself."


Katie scoffed, her tone cutting."Heal Finnegan?You? Don't make me laugh-you're not even a real doctor!"


Just then, Yolanda's voice wavered, choked with theatrical tears. "Christina, how can you stil refuse to acknowledge your misdeeds? If you're angry, take it out on me-not on my father. He's
not in the best health."


"Not in the best health?" Christina's smile was razor-sharp. "Perfect. Not only can I heal him-I'll have him doing cartwheels by next week."


"Christina!" Yolanda's voice cracked as if it were a plea, her eyes shimmering with fake tears. "How can you joke like this? Have you no heart at all?"


"Can you really heal Finnegan? And make him fit as a fiddle?" Katie folded her arms, practically salivating at the chance to spring her trap.


"Absolutely," Christina replied, her voice cool and unwavering, laced with an infuriating calm that only made Katie itch to humiliate her.


"Good!" Katie leaned forward, eyes gleaming with anticipation. "Let's make it interesting. If you pull it off, I'll give you five million. If not-you owe me five million."



Katie couldn't believe how easily Christina had walked into her trap. What an idiot.


"Deal." Christina's answer came without hesitation, her confidence unwavering.


Sheila, who had remained quiet until now, chimed in with a smile that didn't reach her eyes,"Why don't we all get in on this? We'll eaach put up one
million. If you fail, you owe each of us a million."


Katie hesitated, lips pursed-but with everyone watching, backing down wasn't an option.


Finnegan lay perfectly still, struggling to suppress a grin. With his feigning to be seriously wounded on the floor, his family would win three million? It felt like the heavens themselves had wired him a personal jackpot. He wasn't just after the three million-he also planned to squeeze every last penny from Christina for "medical expenses." If he played this right, she'd be paying for everything.


"Please, excuse me for a moment." Christina turned on her heel and disappeared into the hallway.


When she returned, gasps rippled through the room. She was holding a massive syringe-thick,gleaming, and absurdly oversized. It looked like it belonged in a veterinary clinic for sedating lions.


"What... What is that?" Sheila's voice trembled,recoiling instinctively.


Yolanda blinked, stunned. "Christina, you're not seriously going to use that on my dad,are you?"


"Have you lost your mind?" Katie barked, eyes
bulging as she took a step back.


Joselyn's jaw dropped. "You... You're not going to kill him, are you?"


"Kill him?" Christina scoffed, a mischievous glint in her eye. "Please. I'm saving his life." She held the syringe aloft like it was a magic wand. "Relax.I have plenty of experience with this sort of thing."


"Experience?" Yolanda echoed skeptically. "Since when have you ever studied medicine?"


"I didn't," Christina answered cheerfully. "But I am a vet, so that's close enough. Besides, don't be dramatic. A body's a body. One shot from this,and he'll be doing jumping jacks before lunch."
###Chapter 52 This Is Not Saving His Life
Sprawled on the floor, Finnegan's mind spun in a haze of confusion. Only moments ago, he'd been feigning unconsciousness in peace, but the second the word "vet" hit his ears, a surge of panic jolted through him.


He cracked open one wary eye, risking a sly peek at his surroundings-and what he saw nearly made his heart stop. Christina was wielding a syringe so enormous that it looked fit for tranquilizing an elephant. No human being could possibly survive a dose from that thing. Hell, even a wild boar wouldn't stand a chance.


Finnegan had no hesitation believing the needle could drop him dead in a heartbeat. Did Christina intend to bring him down alongside her? His life was valuable. Dying alongside this pathetic bitch would be a colossal waste. She didn't even deserve the honor.


Finnegan squeezed his wife's hand in secret,desperation written in the tension of his grip-a silent cue for Sheila to intervene.


Sheila shot upright, her voice trembling with
outrage. "Absolutely not! You're not using that thing on my husband. Are you out of your mind?You'll kill him!"


Christina didn't bother to argue. She simply reached out a palm, calm and expectant. "AII right, have it your way. You lost the bet, so pay up."


Her cool determination made it clear-she wasn't leaving without that five million. What kind of twisted family threw down million-dollar gambles like pocket change? They were so eager to throw money at her, and she'd be a fool to say no.


Katie, her face flushed with indignation, snapped,"Pay you? For what? You haven't even cured Finnegan!"


Christina cocked an eyebrow, a scornful smirk tugging at her lips. "If you won't let me treat him,how exactly am I supposed to cure him? Let me try, and I promise he'll walk out of here healthy. If I fail,you win.Simple as that."


Yolanda started to plead. "Christina,please-"


But Christina sliced through her words with a cold, flat command. "Enough. Either let me do this or hand over the money. I'm done listening to excuses"
"We won't pay you. What can you... Ah..." Katie tried to push back, but her protest ended in a shriek of pure terror.


Christina lunged, wielding the monstrous syringe like a weapon, her gaze wild and unflinching,radiating a threat that made everyone's blood run cold.



Finnegan snapped awake at the sound, his eyes going wide as he caught sight of Christina storming toward him, that syringe aimed straight at his heart. Whatever hope he'd had of survival instantly evaporated-this woman wasn't trying to save him. She was about to murder him in broad daylight.


"This is a life-saving injection!" Christina declared, slamming the syringe downward with zero hesitation.



"Hell no!" Finnegan barked, panic overtaking his pride."You fucking lunatic-stay away from me!"


He scrambled backward, pale and sweating,rolling out of the way as Christina's "treatment"came down with deadly force. He was sure this woman was insane. Absolutely, irredeemably insane-there was no other word for her.


Christina's wild laughter rang out as she missed
her mark, flinging her arm back for another go.


"You deranged bitch! Are you out of your fucking head?" Finnegan shrieked, scrambling up from the floor. He stumbled forward in a panic."Somebody stop her! She's gone berserk! Stop her! She's about to kill me!"


Gripping the syringe, Christina flashed a deranged grin. Her eyes glittered with a manic light, giving off the unmistakable aura of an escaped lunatic. The syringe hovered menacingly in her fist as she stalked forward, her every movement promising chaos.


"Finnegan!" Sheila gasped, lunging to intercept Christina to protect Finnegan.


But the instant Christina's wild, feral gaze swung in her direction, Sheila's courage shattered. She shrieked, "No! Stay away!"


Sheila stumbled back, tripping over her own feet,eyes wide with pure panic. She wasn't alone-everyone else retreated in frantic disarray.


No one doubted it now: Christina had snapped,gone completely off the rails. There was something chilling about confronting a lunatic-someone who had nothing left to lose and could shatter the rules with a flick of her wrist.That kind
of unpredictable recklessness was terrifying, the threat of sudden violence hanging in the air.


While the others shrank back, Christina whipped around and locked eyes with Finnegan, her grin stretching wider.


The moment Finnegan dared to hope she'd forgotten him, her predatory gaze pinned him in place, icy terror flooding his veins-he was certain this was the end.


"Time for your shot..." Christina grinned,charging forward with the syringe poised like a weapon.She looked like a fanatic soldier, gripping her last grenade-utterly fearless, fully prepared to go down with her target, the menace in her eyes enough to freeze the room.


"Ah..." A strangled cry slipped from Finnegan's lips,panic overwhelming him.
###Chapter 53 I've Got Proof
The house rang with Finnegan's terrified screams, mixed with the panicked shrieks of the others as they scrambled away.


Christina finally stopped, arms crossed and breath steady. "Medicine delivered, illness cured.Time to pay up-I don't do credit."


The group froze, panting, their eyes wide with fear. They stared at her like she might snap at any second.


"What money?" Finnegan gasped, still out of breath.



Christina raised a brow. "The five-million bet remember? What, you trying to weasel out of it now?"


Katie, still catching her breath, glared. "Did you even cure Finnegan? If anything, you owe us-for emotional damage!"


"Of course, I cured him alright," Christina said,pointing at Finnegan. "Look at him. He's wide awake and sprinting like an Olympian. I didn't just bring him back-I upgraded him. Guys half his
age can't keep up."


"That's nonsense!", Sheila snapped, face flushed with anger. She looked like she wanted to lunge-if not for the fear still hanging in the air.


"Anyway, I did my part. You lost and owed me money," Christina said coolly.


Finnegan let out a sharp laugh. "And if we don't pay? What're you gonna do?"


"Yeah!" Katie chimed in, smirking. "What can you possibly do,you psycho?"


"Christina..." Yolanda said softly, once again managing to paint Christina as a villain. "Please be reasonable. You can't just shake people down like this. It's not right."


Christina rolled her eyes. "If I weren't reasonable,you'd all be buried out back by now."


She pulled out a tablet and played a video,holding it out for them to see. "Here's proof. The bet, the win, the miracle cure-all caught on camera. Try stiffing me. I'll post this online and let the world decide." Her voice was steady, each word sharp and sure. Not a hint of fear.


The group paled as they watched the footage.The audio was crystal clear.
Then, without warning, Finnegan snatched the tablet from Christina's hands.



A wave of relief swept through the group.


"Ha!" Finnegan shouted. "No proof now, genius!Good luck getting a dime out of us!"


Katie scoffed. "What'll you post now? Your imaginary win?"


Christina didn't even blink. "Smash that tablet all you want. My security system auto-uploads everything-multiple backups."


Christina turned, locking eyes with Finnegan just as he reached for the security camera overhead,ready to destroy it. She drawled, "And by the way -trying to destroy that camera? That's just more evidence."



She lifted her fingers like a gun and aimed at him with a smirk. "You're in deep."



Meanwhile, Sheila crept up behind Christina,gripping a glass, her eyes burning with rage.


But Christina's senses were razor-sharp. Her hearing, especially, was deadly.


Just as Sheila raised the glass, Christina sidestepped and spun, gripping Sheila's wrist
tightly.


Sheila cried out in pain, "Ah!"


The glass slipped from her hand.


Christina caught the glass just before it hit the floor.


"Mom!" Yolanda shouted,lunging forward.


But Christina's glare froze Yolanda in place.Her grip tightened.


"Ah!" Sheila cried again.


"Christina, please," Yolanda pleaded, eyes red."Let her go. She didn't mean any harm."


Christina gave a cold laugh. "No harm? If this glass had hit me, l'd be bleeding-or dead.You call that harmless?"


Christina raised an eyebrow. "Tell you what-why don't I try the same thing on you, and you tell me how it feels?"



"Yolanda, stop begging her!" Katie barked. "We didn't do anything wrong! This is my brother's house-we can throw her out if we want!"


Christina's voice turned ice-cold. "This house?

Part of my divorce settlement. It belongs to me
now,"



"Says who?" a voice cut in.



Christina turned. Her eyes narrowed. It was Brendon. He stood there, face hard, a bandage on his head, and a storm brewing behind his eyes.She frowned slightly.He was hurt?


"You promised me this house. It's in the agreement," Christina said calmly.


"The agreement says a seaside property. Not this one.And since the papers aren't finalized, it's still mine," Brendon replied coldly. He could still feel the sting-Christina ignoring his calls, climbing into that luxury car without a word of concern.



"But you said this one was mine," Christina said,looking into his eyes.


"Verbal promises don't count. I've changed my mind. It's Yolanda's now," Brendon said.


Christina stared at him for a long moment."Brendon... Going back on your word-What kind of man does that?"



"I don't need your approval to be a man. You think too highly of yourself, Christina," Brendon sneered.
Christina stood there, stunned, eyes flicking to the others. Their faces were full of smug delight.


"You're so clever, right? With all those men you've been charming, I'm sure one of them can buy you a fancy new house," Brendon added with a smirk.


Christina said nothing. She had long stopped expecting anything from him. But his words stil cut deep. Every cruel syllable jabbed like a needle, turning her past sacrifices into one long,bitter joke.
###Chapter 54 The Man Behind Christina
Brendon studied Christina in silence, feeling his resolve waver just a little. "Apologize to them,"he declared, feigning magnanimity. "Maybe I'll let this go. You can stay-at least until you find a place."


Brendon felt he was offering Christina a lifeline,expecting gratitude or at least a flicker of humility.


Christina gave nothing away. She stared straight at him, her face unreadable.



The lively warmth in her eyes had faded, replaced by something tangled and distant.


Anxiety pricked at Brendon, a growing unease winding through him-like he was on the verge of losing something vital, and powerless to stop it.Questions tangled inside his chest, clawing for a way out, and before he couId rein himself in, the words burst from him. "Christina, about that night  111



Christina snapped him down with frosty precision."Save it. You were right all along-I've got a line of men just dying to buy me a house." With an
indifferent shrug, she tried to mask the ache tightening in her chest.


Outwardly, she seemed unruffled, but inside, the sting was sharp and real. Anyone would be hurt after baring their soul, only to watch it tossed aside like garbage. Maybe she was stronger than most, but that didn't mean she didn't bleed. Her heart wasn't made of stone-it was flesh and nerves,raw and breakable.



Her dismissive bravado was gasoline on Brendon's fire. "Oh, so you're admitting it now?Had you cheated on me the whole time during our marriage? Running around behind my back?" he spat the accusation through clenched teeth, his anger barely held in check.


Christina arched an eyebrow, a mocking smile flickering on her lips. "Think whatever you want.I couldn't care less about how you view me."


Her indifference only made Brendon's blood boil.He balled his fists, knuckles whitening as he forced himself not to lose control. "I'm warning you-this is your last chance. Explain yourself, or 1-"



Christina cut him off, her tone chillingly distant."Explain what, exactly? I don't owe you anything.
My life, my rules. I don't answer to anyone, least of all you."


Unfazed, Christina pulled out her phone, her gaze turning playful. "But hey, since you're all dying to know about my so-called rich admirers, why don't I just show you how 'generous' they reallyare?"


Christina unlocked her phone and, with a devil-may-care grin, tapped Davina's number. She fully expected her friend to help her out of this mess by answering the call and playing along. But instead, the line went dead-Davina's phone was switched off.


Katie noticed immediately, her lips curling into a smirk. "What's wrong? Your sugar daddies cut you off the second you needed money?"


Yolanda watched, masking her satisfaction behind a gentle, pitying tone. "Christina, it's okay.You don't have to lie just to save face."



A sly grin curved across Christina's lips as she suddenly thought of Dylan.


Katie's scorn cut through the room. "What the hell are you smirking at? Don't you have anything better to do than loiter here? Maybe you should start worrying about where you'll be sleeping tonight! If it weren't for the Dawsons putting up
with you all these years, you'd have been starving in a gutter somewhere! You worthless leech!" Her voice dripped with malice.


Christina ignored Katie, calmly dialing Dylan's number as she locked eyes with Yolanda. "Take it easy, Yolanda. I wouldn't fight you for Brendon even if you paid me-he's not even fit to carry my man's shoes."



The taunt landed squarely, knocking the air from Brendon's lungs and leaving his pride in tatters.His fists curled at his sides, knuckles pale wvith rage. What the hell made her so sure her so-called man was better than him? How dare she claim he wasn't worthy to carry her man's shoes?


Brendon wasn't alone in his outrage. Joselyn's face twisted with fury, righteous indignation blazing in her eyes. To her, Brendon was flawless -her pride and joy. Hearing Christina toss him aside like yesterday's trash, comparing him to some random sugar daddy, was beyond infuriating.


"That's bullshit!" Joselyn screeched, stabbing a trembling finger in Christina's direction. "It's those filthy sugar daddies of yours who should be begging for the privilege of carrying my son's shoes!"
The commotion filled the air just as Dylan picked up. He didn't hea Christina's voice at first-just the shrill, furious shouting in the background. He frowned, glancing down to confirm the caller ID.Christina's name blinked on his screen. A moment later, her laughter drifted through the line-carefree, mocking, and utterly unbothered by the chaos exploding around her.


"Careful, Mrs. Dawson," Christina purred, her lips curling into a lazy smirk. "If you get any more worked up, we'll need to call you an ambulance.I'd hate for all that pent-up rage to fry your poor,overworked heart."



Christina's voice slipped into a syrupy, mocking falsetto as she aimed her next words straight at the phone. "Darling! Are you listening?"


Dylan blinked, momentarily startled. A traitorous smile tugged at the corner of his mouth.He smothered the surge of joy bubbling up, molding his reply into a deadpan. "Mhm."


The flat grunt slipped out automatically,clipped and almost bored. Only after it hung in the air did he realize-he was supposed to play the doting lover, not some cold bystander.


Christina dialed up the theatrics. Her whine
dripped with faux sadness. "Poor helpless me just got thrown out in the street, all alone. Won't my sweet, generous boyfriend buy me a house?Please?"



Christina doubted she could really gross them out. She barely kept a straight face, the sheer cringe nearly making her gag.


Out of the corner of her eye, she spotted Brendon -his face blotchy, fists trembling, barely containing the urge to explode.


Ordinarily, that kind of baby-voiced simpering would make Dylan want to hurl. If anyone else had tried it, he'd have recoiled in disgust. But somehow,coming from Christina, it felt like a live wire humming right through his chest. Instead of revulsion, a light, fluttery happiness bubbled up inside him. He could picture her perfectly-those big, dramatic puppy eyes, the over-the-top pout,the sly glimmer of mischief sparkling in her gaze.Every ridiculous syllable felt like a teasing caress,sending a wave of warmth pulsing through his veins.
###Chapter 55 Sweet Phone Call
Dylan, usually so logical and quick-witted, found his mind going strangely blank as he listened to Christina. For a stretch of awkward silence, he said nothing at all.


Christina almost started to think he might refuse to help, but then his voice finally broke the tension. "Of course. Which house do you want?"


Relief fluttered through her chest, and a sly little smile touched her lips. She cranked up the sugar in her voice. "So you mean I get to pick any house I want?"



"Yeah. Go ahead-pick whatever catches your eye," Dylan answered smoothly.


A teasing melody wove through her words over the line. "Hmm... Do you happen to have a house by the bay? I'd like to move in tonight."


"I do," Dylan replied without missing a beat. "But there's also the one at Cloudcrest Heights. Why not stay there instead? It's got better views.Honestly, I think it'd suit you more."


Christina gave a light, playful laugh, twirling a
strand of hair around her finger. "Oh, sweetheart,you really spoil me. But the bay mansion's perfect for now. We'll save the one in Cloudcrest Heights for after the wedding-our future love nest,okay?"


Bayfront mansions started at fifty million, while the mansions in Cloudcrest Heights boasting panoramic ocean views easily soared past a hundred million.



Christina knew just flashing a deed to a bayfront mansion would be enough to make Brendon eat his heart out-she didn't even have to bring up the ultra-exclusive estate on Cloudcrest Heights,at least not yet.


As soon as "Cloudcrest Heights" rolled off her tongue, everyone around her sucked in a sharp breath, their eyes wide with disbelef before skepticism hardened their faces.



Estates on Cloudcrest Heights weren't simply expensive-they were legendary, rarely traded,and off-limits to all but the most powerful. It wasn't about money alone. One needed influence that stretched behind closed doors. Even the Hubbard family-top of Dorfield's social food chain-barely managed to snag a single property,
and that was on the lowest rung of the mountain.The closer one got to the summit, the more unimaginable the owner's clout.



The group exchanged looks. Was Christina somehow tied to the Hubbard family? No way in hell! There was no way a family as distinguished as the Hubbard family would give a second glance to a divorced woman-let alone let her through their doors.



"Alright." Dylan's low hum rumbled through the phone,smug and satisfied.



"Thanks, darling! Can you send someone with the key and maybe help me move my things?"Christina cooed,pouring on the sweetness.



"No problem," Dylan replied, his smile so broad that it threatened to split his face.


Christina's voice oozed syrupy affection as she purred, "Hurry up, okay, darling? I'm hanging up now-mwah, mwah! Love you!" With one last exaggerated air kiss, she ended the call.


Even after the line went dead, DDylan sat there,dazed and grinning like a fool. Her honeyed words kept echoing in his mind, replaying over and over,the smile on his face stretching impossibly wider.
He was still drifting in that warm, ridiculous afterglow when the door flew open and a voice cut through his daydream like a splash of cold water.



"Dylan!" Chloe's piercing call cut through his thoughts and anchored him to reality.


He blinked, immediately smothering the stupid grin, though his cheeks still ached from holding it so long. Twisting his brow into a frown, he shot her a look of mild reproach. "You didn't knock,"he said, his voice clipped and cool-though there was a lingering softness that betrayed his mood.


Chloe huffed and crossed her arms, lips jutting into a pout. "I did knock! You just didn't hear me.I walked right in and you were completely zoned out!"


Then, remembering the way he'd been beaming like an idiot, she couldn't help but ask, "Alright,spill. What happened? Why were you grinning like a total idiot just now? Something pleasant?"



She couldn't help herself-she'd never seen her stoic brother look so hopelessly happy.


"Yeah," Dylan responded with a noncommittal hum as he slipped on his suit jacket and headed
for the door.


Chloe trailed after him, her eyes gleaming with curiosity. "What's got you so happy? Spill it-don't leave your dear sister in suspense!"


"Just wrapped up a big deal," Dylan answered briskly before grabbing his keys.


With a dismissive wave, he went straight for the door and stated firmly, "I'm stepping out. You stay here and be good."


"Dylan!" she called, picking up her pace to keep up with him. "Come on, what kind of deal?"


She eyed him skeptically. No ordinary business win could have sparked that ridiculous smile-she was sure of it. Even the biggest contracts never made him beam like a fool. Clearly, he was hiding something. But no matter how she probed,the answer eluded her.



"Quit stressing about my matters," Dylan remarked, slipping into his usual big-brother mode. "Just worry about getting better-I'll handle everything else."



Chloe could see he wasn't going to budge. Once he clammed up, not even wild horses could drag
the truth out of him. She watched him retreat down the hall, letting out a soft, frustrated sigh."If only Christina Were around," she ggrumbled to herself. "She'd have the secret out of him in no time."



Chloe hadn't known Christina for long, but something told her that woman could charm the truth out of anyone-even her stone-faced brother.
###Chapter 56 A Debt's A Debt
At the bay-front villa, after ending the call,Christina turned back to the stunned group with a smirk tugging at her lips. "Did you hear that?That's the kind of man I roll with," she said,eyes gleaming. "And don't even get me started on this measly bay-front villa. If I felt like it,I could move into a mansion at Cloudcrest Heights before sunset."



The group stared at Christina in disbelief, but she didn't flinch. She knew if she so much as whispered a word as King, her hidden identity,the powerful elite of Cloudcrest Heights would be scrambling to hand her their keys and beg her to take their million-dollar properties off their hands. After all, she could do what no world-renowned doctor could: cheat death.She didn't sell medicine. She sold time. And to billionaires, a few more years of life was worth more than anything they owned.



"Christina, you're being reckless again,pretending to have a phone call with some affluent elderly gentleman," Yolanda said gently,her brows furrowed in mock concern as she
made a subtle attempt to smear Christina's reputation. "Be careful. Not everyone has good intentions, and some might leech onto you for life..."



Katie rolled her eyes and jerked Yolanda aside."Are you stupid or what? Why are you still worried about her?" she hissed. "Let her crash and burn! If she wants to throw herself off a cliff, don't offer her a parachute!"



"Exactly, Yolanda!" Joselyn cut in, her voice heavy with disdain as she shook her head."Don't waste your kindness on someone like Christina. Tramps like her don't see compassion -they see a stepping stone. She'll use your goodwill to claw her way up."



Finnegan let out a scoff, lips curled in a sneer."She's clearly putting on a show. A mansion on Cloudcrest Heights? That was a dead giveaway that she's bluffing. Even the Hubbard family-the wealthiest in Dorfield-lives at the base tier.And she expects us to believe she could worm her way into their circle?" He chuckled darkly."A divorced woman with no name and no backing? Please."



What no one knew-what Finnegan would never admit-was that he and his wife hadn't
come to town just to visit Brendon in his hospital bed. That was the excuse. Their true aim was the upcoming Hubbard banquet, which celebrated the joy of locating a long-missed daughter. The Mitchell Group was hemorrhaging money.One connection,one introduction,could save it. The Hubbards were the last rope keeping the Mitchell Group from collapsing.



And now there were whispers-dangerous whispers-that Samuel Graham, a kingmaker from the Dorfield, would be attending.



Finnegan doubted Christina had any connection with the Hubbard family. Unless, of course, she was the long-lost daughter the Hubbards were preparing to welcome home.



Finnegan nearly laughed aloud at the thought.He had his own sources. Christina wasn't even a blip on the Hubbard radar.



"Everyone knows that the people who live on Cloudcrest Heights aren't just rich. They're untouchable," Sheila added, her nose tilted arrogantly.If someone like Christina could charm her way into that circle, then her daughter would've been the Hussain family's mistress a long time ago.
"Let's not forget-this house? Christina only got to live in it because of my brother. Now she's dreaming of Cloudcrest Heights? Delusional doesn't even begin to cover it." Katie folded her arms and leaned in with a smirk.



"I'm staying right here," Katie snapped, arms crossed defiantly. "Christina, let us see how long you actuallylast in this neighborhood."



To Katie, this was just another one of Christina's desperate charades-some pitiful attempt to save face with a well-rehearsed lie. The mansions in this neighborhood were worth tens of millions. How could a jobless, cast-off slut like Christina afford even a corner of one?



In Katie's eyes, Christina was beneath her.Pathetic. Unworthy.



But Christina didn't flinch. She cocked a brow,amusement dancing in her eyes. "So that's it?You're all really going to welch on a bet?"


Finnegan flinched. "W-what bet? We didn't agree to anything like that-"



"You did," Christina said coolly. "Each of you-one milion. That was the deal. Now, pay up."
Her gaze slid to Brendon like a dagger dipped in silk. "Hey, care to be chivalrous and cover their bill?" she said, voice dripping with mockery.



Brendon's brows knotted. "What the hell is going on?"



Christina didn't bother answering. She didn't need to. "A bet's a bet. A debt's a debt," she continued, her tone ice-cold. "If five million's too much for you to stomach, that's fine. Just don't blame me when this hits the internet."



Her stare swept over the group like a blade."You have 24 hours. One day. If I don't see that money in my account by then..." She leaned in slightly, voice dropping to a whisper. "I will go public." Her smile was wicked. "And when Mitchell and Dawson stocks start tanking, five millionwill look like pocket change."



After everything Brendon had put her through,Christina felt she had shown more mercy than any of these people deserved.



Brendon's voice sharpened, frustration seeping in as he turned to his mom and the others."What the hell happened here?" Since Christina refused to elaborate, he sought answers elsewhere.
Finnegan let out an exaggerated sigh, as if the weight of Christina's words were some unbearable injustice. "Brendon, don't let her manipulate you. There was no bet-she's making it up."



"Yeah, she's just-" Joselyn tried to badmouth Christina, but the moment Brendon's glare snapped to her, she fell silent.



"Enough!" Brendon's voice was sharp, clipped.His eyes settled on Yolanda. "Tell me the truth."



Yolanda felt her throat tighten. She wanted-desperately-to twist the story, but one look at Brendon told her it would be useless.Worse-Christina had proof, that damned surveillance footage...



"Brendon..." Yolanda's voice cracked as she slipped into her theatrical acting again. "We did make a bet with Christina. And we...We lost."Tears brimmed in her eyes, and when she looked at him, it wasn't just guilt-it was fear."I'm... I'm so sorry."



Brendon's jaw clenched. His eyes narrowed as he scanned the group with disdain. "You lost, so pay what you owe. Or are you really trying to
cheat your way out of it?"




Histonedripped	with	contempt.Their shamelessness didn't just disgust him-it embarrassed him, especially in front of Christina.




"N-no! Of course not!" Yolanda stammered,her fingers fumbling for her phone. "I'll transfer it-right now. Please, Brendon, don't be angry
###Chapter 57 Brendon Snapped
The moment Brendon saw Yolanda's tear-streaked face, something in him caved. His anger melted away, replaced by concern. He reached for her hand and pulled her into his embrace. "I'm sorry... I shouldn't have raised my voice."



Yolanda sniffled softly,her eyes lowered as she played the part of the heartbroken girlfriend."No, it's okay. We brought this on ourselves.You had every right to be upset... I'll send Christina the money right now-"



"No need," Brendon interrupted. "I'll handle it.I'll transfer the five million."



A flicker of joy crossed Yolanda's face, but she quickly masked it with another sob. "How can we let you pay up?"



He shook his head. "Why not? We're about to get married. What's mine is yours."



"But-" Yolanda started, but he silenced her with a qentle finger against her lips. "No more
buts. Let me take care of it."



"Brendon, you're too kind to me. I don't even know how I'll ever repay you," she whispered,burying herself in his arms.



"Just marry me," he murmured, brushing her hair back. "That's alLI want."



"I can't wait for our big day. It'll be magical,won't it?" she cooed.



"It'll be everything you've dreamed of," he promised. "You deserve nothing less."



Yolanda nodded eagerly. "I know you'll make it perfect."



Christina's sharp voice broke their moment. "If you lovebirds are done, can we wrap this up?I've got things to do." She was disgusted by their nauseating display.



Brendon turned to Christina with a glare, his expression darkening. Was she really that eager to run off to another man? Living with him like some cheap rebound? "Relax. You'll get every penny," he said coldly.



"I'll believe it when I see the funds in my
account," Christina replied, unimpressed.



Brendon's jaw tightened. "I never realized how greedy and shallow you were."



"Appreciate the insight," she said with a dry smile. "Now, how about the transfer of the five million?"



Grinding his teeth, Brendon tapped on his phone and completed the transfer. "There. Five million.We're square."



Christina checked her screen and then nodded."Confirmed. The bet's done. But don't forget-"She met his eyes calmly. "There's still the divorce settlement. The compensation and the villa. I expect the paperwork soon."



"You'll get it," Brendon said through clenched teeth. "Every damn bit."



"I hope so," Christina said, her voice light and unbothered, yet the warning beneath it rang clear as day. "I'd hate to bring lawyers or journalists into this."



Brendon's eyes darkened as he was pissed off by her. But then, a new theory bloomed in his mind-twisted yet strangely comforting. Maybe
this wasn't indifference. Maybe Christina was just putting on an elaborate show, desperate for his attention. Maybe she still loved him.That would explain everything-her defiance,her theatrics, even her sudden independence.The idea stroked his pride. Of course. She couldn't possibly have moved on.



"Did that man really dispatch people to help you move?" Brendon asked, voice tinged with disbelief. "You didn't have to stage this whole act to test me, Christina. My heart belongs to Yolanda-it always will. You need to stop. This childish game isn't going to-"



Ding-dong. The doorbell interrupted his speech mid-sentence, killing the smug expression on his face.



Without sparing him a glance, Christina walked over and tapped the video feed.



"Hello, we're from the moving company-" The camera revealed a group of tall, broad-shouldered men standing in uniform at the door.They looked like they could lift a truck with one hand and crush a skull with the other.



Christina's eyes narrowed slightly. Her instincts kicked in. Years of reading people made it easy
to see through their disguises. These guys were definitely not average movers.



Just as suspicion stirred, her phone buzzed. It was Dylan. She picked up immediately.



"The moving team's outside," Dylan said calmly."If anyone gives you trouble, they'll take care of it. Whatever happens, I've got your back."



Christina froze, stunned by the sincerity in his tone. He was protecting her. No questions. No blame. Just quiet, unwavering support. If it had been Brendon, he would've accused her first-mocked her, scolded her, and blamed her.Warmth was never part of the equation.



"Hello? Are they bothering you again?" Dylan's voice pulled her back.



"N-No." She snapped out of it. Then, in a deliberately sweet, exaggerated tone, she added, "Darling, you're amazing-l love you!Mwah!"



Dylan choked back a laugh on the other end.Her sudden sweetness clearly caught him off guard. Today just kept getting more entertaining.



"Okay, baby, go do your thing. I'll call once the
move's done. Kisses, bye!" Christina ended the call, still blushing from her over-the-top act.She had no clue how he'd take the sudden sugarcoated theatrics, but she committed anyway.



Behind her, Brendon looked like he might explode.Since when was Christina like this? She had never acted this way with him. Not once had she been this playful, this radiant.Yet,here she was, cooing like some lovesick schoolgirl for a sugar daddy?



Jealousy coiled inside Brendon, white-hot and bitter. This wwasn't the Christina he'd married and dismissed as dull and lifeless. No,this woman was magnetic. Confident. Irresistible. Every glance, every word seemed crafted to captivate.



As Christina opened the door to let the movers in, something in Brendon snapped. Rage overtook reason, and he lunged forward-
###Chapter 58 She Was Just A Stand-In
Brendon's eyes burned with rage as he stormed forward-then, without warning, slammed Christina against the wall. His hand locked around her throat, fingers biting into her skin."Christina, do you get off on seducing other men?" he growled, face inches from hers.



Around them, the others just watched-eyes glittering, lips twitching in satisfaction. No one moved to stop him. No one dared.



"Are you insane?" Christina hissed, her voice a razor blade of defiance. "Who have I seduced?What are you even talking about?"



She couldn't get it. What the hell was wrong with him? Just moments ago, he'd been composed-cold,maybe,but in control.Now he looked feral. Unhinged. His eyes were bloodshot,his breath ragged. Was he having a stroke or some kind of psychotic breakdown?



"You never dressed up for me," Brendon sneered. "Always cold. Distant. Treated me like
I was in your way. But once another man glances at you, you're all smiles and softness suddenly?"



Christina's laugh was sharp, bitter, laced with something venomous. She had dressed up for Brendon once.



The memory hit her like a freight train. It was the day Brendon had finally walked again-no wheelchair, no crutches, just his own two legs beneath him. She'd been ecstatic. To celebrate,she spared no effort. A full spa day. Hair curled into soft, elegant waves. Flawless makeup. A new dress-deep burgundy, his favorite color.Heels she hadn't worn in years.



She had spent hours preparing a candlelit dinner-his favorite dishes, arranged with meticulous care. Every detail was perfect. Every second was charged with anticipation.But as the sun dipped lower, he hadn't come home.



The food had cooled. She reheated it. It cooled again. She kept trying-like maybe if she kept the dinner warm, she could keep hope alive,too.



But food could be reheated. A numb heart could not.
That was the thing about divorce-it was rarely sparked by a single explosion. It was the weight of a thousand quiet disappointments, slowly crushing everything beneath them until nothing was left but frost.



By the time midnight had crept in, so had Brendon-reeking of alcohol, jacket half-buttoned, eyes glassy. She was still there. Alone in the dark. The candles had burned out. The food had crusted over.



He had staggered in, saw her, and whispered,"Yolanda... I missed you so much."



Her heart hadn't just been broken. It had been shattered. He had clung to her, slurring promises meant for someone else, pouring out love that was never hers to keep. Every word was a dagger.



And then, when he had reached for Christina-tried to kiss her, touch her, take her-she shoved him back. His breath was sour. His hands,unwelcome.



When he had lurched toward her again, she slapped him as hard as she could. "Open your damn eyes!" she hissed, her voice low and
shaking with fury. "I'm Christina. Not Yolanda."



Then, Christina had turned and walked away,each step slicing through the silence like a blade.Her dress flared behind her, the final flicker of a flame she'd kept alive far too long. That night,she stripped off every trace of hope. She wiped away her makeup with shaking hands. Tore the dress from her body like it was made of lies.Kicked off the heels. Tossed it all in the trash.



Christina had never dressed up again. It wasn't about giving up-it was about refusing to be someone else's step-in. Brendon only ever looked at her when she was dolled up enough to blur into another woman. She wasn't a placeholder. She wasn't a goddamn echo. She was Christina. And no one-no one-got to treat her like a consolation prize.



Brendon had never understood why Christina defaulted to simple clothes. He never saw her exhaustion. The endless caregiving. Cooking,cleaning, bathing him, lifting him, catching him when he stumbled. Holding in her tears until she could cry quietly behind a locked bathroom door.For months, she had been nurse, maid,cook, therapist, punching bag, all while he simmered in bitterness and lashed out at her like
she was the reason he fell. But she had endured in silence.



And now-now, after everything-Brendon accused her of dressing up for other men but never for him? As if he hadn't pissed all over every effort she'd made. A broken laugh tore from her throat, raw and jagged. The irony. The absolute absurdity.



Her eyes met Brendon's-wild, gleaming,unhinged-and her laughter broke loose, sharp and spiraling into hysteria. It was the laugh of someone who had bled too much to cry anymore.
###Chapter 59 Think You Deserve That
Brendon froze at the sound of Christina's laughter. His brows pulled tight. "What the hell are you laughing at?"



"She's snapped!" Katie shrieked, fear sharpening her voice. "She's been a ticking time bomb since day one-just throw her in a damn asylum already!"



Yolanda hesitated, wringing her hands as if she were offering a piece of wise advice instead of plotting against Christina. "Maybe something set Christina off. We should take her to a hospital. Let a doctor-"



"Hospital?" Finnegan cut in with a snort."Hell no!She's insane. What she needs is a padded cell and a straitjacket."



Christina's laughter died,replaced by a deadly calm."You think I'm the crazy one?" Her voice was low, chilling. "No. I'm the sole clear one here."



The moment her eyes locked with theirs,
something in them recoiled. They backed up-all of them



"Someone like you should be locked in a padded cell!" Katie spat, her voice sharp with venom



Katie hated Christina's guts. This conniving bitch knew too much, even including skeletons deep in her cupboard. Besides, every step Christina took chipped away at her plans. Christina had to be erased. Crushed. Eliminated-whatever it took



Driven by that thought, Katie snapped, "Hold her down! I'm calling the asylum. Let them deal with her madness!"



Christina responded with a laugh-chill and dripping contempt, "You? Take me down?Don't make me laugh."



"Why can't you ever just surrender? Why is it always a goddamn war with you?" Brendon snarled, voice ragged with rage. "Say you're sorry, and I'll act like none of this ever happened." His tone was low and dangerous.



What Brendon truly craved wasn't peace-it was control. He wanted to see Christina break. To
watch that fire in her eyes fade, replaced with the same docile obedience she reserved for those old men she charmed.



"Apologize?" Christina scoffed, her smirk razor -sharp. "You think you deserve that?"



The mocking curl of her lips sent Brendon over the edge. His hands closed around her throat,grip unrelenting.



Christina's face turned scarlet as her breath hitched, the air cut off, her body trembling beneath the weight of his fury.



Brendon wanted her to feel it-that creeping,breathless panic. If brute force was what it took to break her, then so be it. How could he let this stubborn little woman keep disrespecting him?



Across the room, the massive movers stood still,muscles taut, eyes locked on the chaos.Only Christina's earlier glance-a silent command layered with warning-kept them from intervening and leaping into the fray.



"How about now, Christina?" Brendon growled,his jaw clenched, shaking her with barely restrained fury. "Still think we don't deserve it?"
Her lips curved into a slow, merciless smirk-cool, composed, and cutting "Not Even Close"



The ease of her contempt, the unshaken confidence in her gaze-it ignited Brendon's fury like gasoline on fire. His fingers dug in tighter, joints creaking, skin stretched bone-white with rage



On the sidelines, Katie and the others basked in the moment, faces lit with vindictive glee.Finally, someone was clipping Christina's wings.How was Christina going to act high and mighty now? They stood there watching,like vultures circling roadkill. The movers stood like statues -pathetic,paralyzed,hiding behind silence and uniforms. Cowards, every last one. Not a soul among them dared defy the Dawsons.



Overcome with smug adrenaline, Katie stepped forward. Her eyes gleamed with cruel satisfaction, lips curled in triumph. She raised her hand and swung-ready to mark Christina's face-but pain bloomed across her gut instead.



"Ahh!" Katie's scream ripped through the room as she collapsed, limbs folding awkwardly beneath her. She hit the floor with a sickening thud,gasping, clutching her stomach.
"Katiel" Yolanda shrieked, scrambling to her knees beside Katie, panic etched in every line of her face



Yolanda spun on Christina, voice cracking "Why did you kick her like that?"



Christina's expression was ice. "If you're so concerned, then why don't you take her place and let me kick you instead?"



"Christina .." Yolanda whispered, apparent rawness bleeding into her voice. "Do you still hate me that much?" She took a breath that rattled in her chest and then stepped forward,trembling. "If you need to let it out-your anger,your grievance-take it out on me. I won't fight.Scream, hit, whatever you want. I deserve it."


Christina tilted her head, studying Yolanda. Then,her face twisted into something colder than contempt. "Why would I waste my energy on you? Even touching you would make me feel dirty."



The insut landed like a blade. Yolanda's mouth trembled, and tears spilled unchecked down her cheeks. She looked utterly broken-like a porcelain doll cracked beyond repair,
abandoned and ashamed



That sight struck Brendon like a punch to the chest Something twisted deep inside him His gaze snapped to Christina, dark and thunderous,fists clenched. "You got a death wish, Christina?"he growled, his voice coiled with venom



His hands, which had momentarily slackened,clamped down again-sudden and brutal, like a steel trap snapping shut



But Christina didn't recoil. Her eyes met his with a ferocity that burned cold. "No," she whispered,lips curling. "But it surelooks like you are."



She barely tilted her head-just a subtle cue-and suddenly, those towering, muscle-bound movers jumped on Brendon.



"Ugh!" Brendon didn't even get a full breath before a hand like a steel trap snapped around his neck. His lungs collapsed inward. Darkness crept at the edges of his vision as panic surged to the surface. He wasn't choking Christina anymore. Now he was the one clawing for air.



Brendon's hands beat against his captor's arm,fists pounding helplessly against muscle that might as well have been concrete. His captor
didn't even blink.



"Brendon!" Yolanda lunged forward-only to be snatched mid-step. Another mover hoisted her up by the throat, her heels scraping for purchase that didn't exist.



Every one of them-dragged off the floor like rag dolls. Legs kicked. Fingers scratched. But it was like watching insects caught in the jaws of lions.



"L-Let. . go.,. please.." Katie choked out the words, her voice strangled, her face contorted in terror. Tears streamed down her cheeks as she fought with every ounce of strength she had.



She kicked. She writhed. But her captor's grip was inhuman-unyielding. Her lungs screamed.Her limbs weakened. The black haze pulled tighter around her, whispering finality. What the hell? No! She couldn't accept it! She refused to die here. Not in this place. Not like this.There was still a life waiting for her-glamour, wealth,indulgence.She was meant for more.



With a final burst of fading energy, Katie clawed at the fingers around her neck, her mouth to make a bid of screaming. "H-Help!"
###Chapter 60 Looked Death In The Face
Suspended midair like helpless puppets,Brendon and the others were completely at the mercy of the towering men who held them. The pressure around their necks grew unbearable As the world blurred and darkened, they imagined flickers of the afterlife-familiar,comforting faces waving from the beyond Perhaps their deceased relatives, arms open in welcome



Christina touched her neck, wincing slightly. The raw, red bruises left by Brendon's grip were already darkening against her skin. "That's enough," she said, her voice low but firm. "I don't want anyone dead. Not today."



She knew if she didn't stop this now, these burly men would have finished Brendon and the others right here and now. These burly men obviously were Dylan's guards, dressed in movers' uniforms as a disguise, ruthless and highly trained.



At her command, the men released their grip.
Brendon and the others dropped like sacks of grain, hitting the floor with heavy thuds and sharp groans



Christina didn't even glance at Brendon and the others She turned to the men with a composed nod. "Let's begin moving my belongings I appreciate your help."



"No problem," they replied respectfully and then asked which boxes to pack first



Following Christina's instructions, the men began gathering her belongings and carrying them into the living room



Meanwhile, Brendon and the others lay scattered across the floor, wheezing and coughing like broken puppets



"Yolanda..." Brendon rasped, dragging himself toward her "Are you okay?"



Yolanda looked shattered. Her hair was a tangled mess, her cheeks streaked with tears,and her eyes red and puffy from crying She shook slightly as she tried to sit up.



"I-I'm fine," she whispered, her voice barely steady. "What about you?"
Brendon's chest tightened with emotion Even in her terrified state, she still worried about him He wrapped his arms around her,holding her close "I'm alright. I've got you"



"I really thought... We weren't gonna make it,"she sobbed into his chest, trembling uncontrollably



"I won't let anything happen to you," he murmured, holding her tightly. But his heart boiled with rage. Christina That witch. And those bastards in uniform. They'd pay for this



Brendon turned his glare on Christina, his hands curling into fists. He wanted nothing more than to lash out-but now wasn't the time. These men could kill them in seconds if provoked again



No,he'd wait. Then, he'd call the police. Press charges. Sue every last one of them if he had to They'd regret ever laying a hand on him



Yolanda clutched his arm, her voice barely a whisper. "Brendon, they're monsters..." She sniffled and added, "They don't look like movers... Do you think Christina brought them here just to hurt us?"
Brendon's expression stiffened. He turned to study the men more closely Now that Yolanda mentioned it, something felt off. They weren't just tall-they were built like tanks. Each one had the same intimidating frame, the same steely, expressionless stare. They looked more like bodyguards or hired muscle. Could Christina really have staged this? Hired these men to rough them up just to make a point? And if that was true, then what about Christina's earlier bravado? The villa, the 'darling'-was it all a show? There was no way Christina could afford a place like this on her own. No way she'd landed a rich partner who let her live here. His jaw clenched. He'd find out soon enough-he just had to see where they moved her things.



While Brendon was lost in thought, Katie finally caught her breath-and with it came a volcanic burst of rage. She launched herself at Christina,grabbing her collar with a snarl. She yanked,trying to drag Christina forward, but Christina didn't move an inch.



Katie ended up just standing there, breathing hard, face flushed with rage and humiliation."You psycho bitch!" she screamed. "What the hell is wrong with you? Are you trying to kill us?I swear, I'll call the cops! You and those thugs
I swear, I'll call the cops! You and those thugs -you'll all rot in jail!"



Brendon's heart sank. That was his plan-one he'd meant to carry out quietly once they were out of danger. But now, thanks to his hot-headed sister, that card had been thrown on the table.He clenched his jaw, barely containing the panic rising in his chest. If Christina believed they were a threat-if she even suspected he might go to the police-there was no telling what she'd do next. For all he knew, they might not make it out of here at all.
###Chapter 61 Decided Against Calling The Police
Christina's gaze didn't waver. With a faint, icy smile curling on her lips, she looked Katie dead in the eye. "Call the police? Please. You don't have the guts."



That smug tone lit a fuse. "You think I won't?"Katie snapped."Watch me!"



Christina gave a casual shrug, her voice like ice."Be my guest. Go ahead."



Fueled by rage, Katie yanked out her phone."Just you wait."



But before Katie could press a button, Brendon stepped in and snatched the phone from her hand.



"What the hell, Brendon?" Katie barked, furious."Give it back! She almost killed us-we have to report her!"



"Let it go," Brendon said firmly. "We're still breathing,aren't we?"
In truth, he didn't believe they were safe. Not with Christina standing there like nothing could touch her. Something about the calm in her eyes made his gut twist with fear. If they pushed her,who knew what she'd do?



"Let it go?" Katie's voice cracked as it rose. "We were almost killed! Are you seriously defending her? What, do you feel bad for her now?"



"Brendon..." Yolanda stepped up beside him,her voice soft and eyes red-rimmed. She slipped her hand into his. "I get it. Maybe we should just let it go. We owe her that much.Stirring up more trouble won't help anyone."



Yolanda had hoped to play the gracious one-putting on a show of generosity to guilt Brendon into being harsher with Christina. But to her dismay, he gave her a gentle smile and lightly patted her head. "You're always so understanding,Yolanda."



Yolanda's stomach twisted, but she forced a tender smile. "Whatever you decide, I'm with you."



"Thanks," Brendon said simply and then turned to Katie, handing back her phone with a firm
look. "No one's calling the police. Understood?"



Across the room, Finnegan had quietly pulled out his phone to involve the police, but Brendon's sharp gaze locked on him. He hesitated and then reluctantly slid it back into his pocket. If he didn't need the Dawson family as allies right now, he wouldn't be putting up with this circus at all.



The Mitchells stood simmering in silence, their faces tight with restrained fury. Inwardly, they cursed Brendon-gritting their teeth at his cowardice, blaming him for this disgrace. If only they had someone stronger backing them,they wouldn't have been forced to swallow this humiliation.



But Christina couldn't have cared less about their silent rage or whispered resentment.Whatever games they played in their heads didn't concern her. As long as they stayed out of her way, she wouldn't lift a finger against them. But if they pushed their luck, she'd happily let them choke on the consequences.



As the movers wrapped up, Christina headed toward the door without a backward glance.Brendon trailed behind her, stubbornly refusing to leave. He needed to see for himself. Part of
him still believed she was bluffing. If she wasn't really moving into one of those luxury villas, it would confirm everything-this was just another desperate act to win him back. After all,women didn't go to such lengths unless they were still obsessed. And Christina had to be that kind of woman.



The more he convinced himself, the more self -satisfied he became. By the time he and the others reached the moving truck, his confidence was practically oozing from his smug grin.



Christina's belongings were minimal, and the movers had already packed most of them. But one item made Brendon pause.



"What the hell is that?" Brendon asked,frowning at a massive syringe tucked neatly among her things. It looked bizarre-out of place. Was it some kind of weird bedroom toy?



"Oh, that?" Christina said with a shrug. "It's for dealing with the garbage."



Katie's temper snapped. "Christina! You're the garbage!"
Christina turned her head slowly and gave Katie a lazy smirk. "Huh. I didn't name anyone, but if the shoe fits..." Then, tapping her temple with a mockingly sympathetic look, she added, "You might wanna get that checked out, though.Something tells me a few screws are loose up there."



"You!" Katie sputtered, shaking with fury, her face flushed red as her temper boiled over.
###Chapter 62 Make Her Leave Empty-Handed
Christina rolled her eyes. "If you're sick, go see a doctor," she snapped, her tone cutting.



Katie's fury crackled in the air, her hands practically itching to smack Christina across the face. But before she could so much as twitch,a hulking brute of a man stepped into her path,his massive frame swallowing up the space between them.



Katie froze,breath hitching as her arm jerked back on instinct. The memory of those meaty hands wrapped around her neck-the brutal force that had left her dangling and helpless-flashed across her mind, squeezing the air from her lungs all over again. A raw, animal panic seized her, rooting her to the spot. No way was she risking getting snatched up like that a second time.



Katie's voice came out in a quivering stammer as she gazed at the man. "Y-you... What on earth do you think you're doing? I-I'm warning you,I could... I could call the cops..."
The man didn't so much as blink, his blank stare boring into her with all the warmth of a tombstone.



The cold in his eyes made her skin crawl, like a ghost brushing icy fingers over her scalp. She couldn't even bring herself to look at him for more than a second-her gaze kept slipping away, chased by that creeping, suffocating dread.



Only after Christina and her entourage of muscle piled into the moving truck did the tension finally ease from Katie'schest.She let out a shaky breath, relief flooding her as that paralyzing fear slowly uncoiled and faded away.



"Get in," Brendon called out, his voice clipped and unreadable as he opened his car door and slid inside, leaving Katie no choice but to follow.



Their two vehicles stayed glued to Christina's truck. Brendon refused to believe Christina had actually become some pampered mistress for a wealthy benefactor.



Katie squinted out the window, her brows knitting together. "Isn't this the road to the hillside mansions?" she muttered.
In a syrupy,mock-worried tone, Yolanda leaned forward. "They haven't left this neighborhood ... Could they really be headed for one of those exclusive estates? You don't think Christina's tangled up with some old, filthy-rich guy, do you? Perhaps..."



Yolanda let her voice trail off, deliberately sowing seeds of suspicion.



Katie scoffed, crossing her arms, "Is there any doubt? It's written all over her face. She's absolutely bagged herself a sugar daddy. Who in their right mind would choose a washed-up divorcée and treat her so generously?"



Yolanda shot Brendon a pointed look. The tension in his jaw and the way his knuckles blanched on the steering wheel made it clear he was barely holding it together.



Yolanda affected a thoughtful sigh. "Well, she is divorced now. Honestly, whatever she does isn't anyone else's business. If a woman can't fend for herself, what choice does she have but to cling to a man with deep pockets? Stil..."She let the thought hang tantalizingly in the air.



Brendon's fingers dug even deeper into the
leather, his breathing strained as he struggled for composure. He pressed, forcing a veneer of calm into his voice. "Still what?"



"Oh, it's probably not my place to say. Just forget it," Yolanda murmured softly, glancing away as if she'd lost the nerve.



"What's so hard about just saying it out loud? If Christina was gutsy enough to pull that stunt,she should at least have the backbone to admit it! If you won't say it, I will!" Katie barreled in,unable to restrain herself. "Brendon, what Yolanda won't spit out is that that bitch Christina was screwing you way before the divorce!"



Yolanda appeared to play peacemaker, raising her hands as if to calm Katie down. "Katie, we really don't have any evidence. Let's not jump to conclusions."



"What's there to be afraid of?" Katie shot back,her voice trembling with outrage. "No evidence?Then let's go find some!" Her entire body trembled with fury at the thought of that slut Christina getting her hands on even a penny of their money.



Katie whipped around to face Brendon, eyes
blazing with contempt. "Brendon, listen to me.We have to dig up proof Christina cheated during the marriage. Force her out with nothing -don't let her walk away with a dime!"



Just imagining Christina pocketing a villa and millions in alimony made Katie's blood pressure spike. That was Dawson money, damn it-she'd die before letting some outsider waltz off with their family fortune.



Yolanda put on her most delicate, worried expression. "But they're already divorced. The settlement's signed. Trying to break it now would just rack up penalties. Besides, collecting hard evidence of cheating is nearly impossible."



Of course, as the soon-to-be Mrs. Dawson,Yolanda was just as eager to see Christina lose everything. She simply preferred to play the gentle, reasonable type, letting Katie wear the villain's mask.



Katie's gaze flicked left and right, scheming.Suddenly, a cold,triumphant grin twisted across her lips. "Actually, I've got a way to make sure she forfeits everything."
###Chapter 63 Brendon's
Overconfidence



Yolanda leaned in, her voice sharp with anticipation. "So, what's your plan?"



A wicked smile curled across Katie's lips. "Easy.We drug Christina, stage a few scandalous photos with some random scumbag, and then shove the evidence in her face until she signs everything away in the divorce."



Satisfaction radiated from Katie-she looked downright gleeful at her own cunning.



Noting Brendon's jaw tightened, his eyes turning stormy,Yolanda hurried to play the voice of reason,clutching Katie's arm, her voice tinged with fake caution. "Katie, that's going too far.We can't just frame Christina for something she didn't do."



Katie clenched her jaw and hissed the words in a low, seething tone, "Why not? She's just a shameless slut. She acts like a whore and dared betrayed my brother. I'll make her wish she'd never been born!"
Brendon shot Katie with a cutting glare. "That's enough. Stay out of this."



Katie bristled, refusing to back down. "Why are you always so quick to defend her? What kind of witchcraft did she use on you?"



Katie spat out her next words, her anger simmering, "She's cuckolded you, and you just stand there and take it? Even if you can stomach it, don't you at least think about Yolanda? Why should that despicable bitch get the house and the money? All of it should go to Yolanda! She's about to marry you. She's the future lady of this family!"



Masking her glee, Yolanda intervened with a gentle sigh, lowering her gaze as if resigned "Katie, don't say things like that... Christina still deserves some kind of compensation. Even if l have to suffer a little, I'm willing. I trust your brother to do what's fair. He would never let me lose out in the end."



Katie's frustration simmered in her glare."Yolanda, you're way too soft. If you keep this up, that bitch will trample all over you one day."


"I..." Yolanda's head drooped, her voice barely
audible. "I just... I believe in your brother. He'll keep me safe."



Brendon's voice cut through the tension, cold and absolute. "That's enough. Whatever's between me and Christina is my business. None of you are to meddle."



When the car rolled to a stop, Brendon shot Katie a look sharp enough to make her flinch."And if you dare go through with that filthy little scheme, don't think I'll let it slide just because you're my sister."



Katie's hands balled into fists as she pressed."Just be honest-do you still have feelings for Christina?"



"No." Brendon bristled, his tone sharp and his features clouded with irritation.



Before Katie could challenge him, he yanked the door open and strode out. "We're done here."He left the two women in stunned silence.



Katie glowered after him, chest heaving with fury. When she finally turned, she found Yolanda biting her lip, tears gathering in her eyes.
"Yolanda..." Katie's words carried a soft wave of empathy. "Don't let it get to you, alright?There's no way my brother still has feelings for that tramp. She's out there sleeping around-who'd want disgusting leftovers like her?Brendon could have anyone in the world.Why would he ever settle for that slut?"



A faint, trembling sniff escaped Yolanda.The acting skills she showcased were impressive enough to earn her an Academy Award for Best Actress. "I know... I do trust him. It's just... It's a bit hard not to feel hurt."



Katie reached over, her eyes full of steely promise. "Don't fret. You're the only sister-in-law I'll ever acknowledge. That's never changing.I've got your back, no matter what."



Yolanda met her gaze, measured gratitude shining through the sheen of tears. "Thank you,Katie.I mean it-I'll never forget your kindness."



"Enough of this. Let's go find your parents.Your dad said he's cooked up a plan for dealing with that bitch." With an exasperated huff, Katie yanked the car door open and strode out.


At that moment, Brendon was already striding
across the courtyard, his expression stormy.



The moving truck sat squarely in the driveway,its engine still idling as a crew of burly men lugged boxes into the house.



Christina stood at the center of the chaos,calmly directing the movers with crisp, decisive gestures.



Brendon stalked up to her, eyes narrowed with suspicion. "Drop the act, Christina. Why don't you just admit it?" he demanded, his voice sharp as broken glass. "This place is just a rented prop -part of your little charade."



He then seized her shoulders, compelling her to meet his gaze. "Where are the staff? If this is really your house, why is there no one around?"



A cocky grin flickered across his face, as if he'd just exposed her greatest secret.
###Chapter 64 The Servants Greeted In Unison
Christina's grin dazzled, her eyes flickering with sly amusement as she watched Brendon.Who would've guessed her ex-husband could be this delusional,his mind crafting an absurd theory of her staging an act just for his attention? She cocked a brow, her voice laced with mockery."You think I'm putting on a show for you?"



Brendon squared his shoulders, flashing a confident smirk. "Isn't that exactly what you're doing right now?"



With a low, melodic laugh, Christina dipped her chin and then lifted her gaze to meet his. "You really think I'd waste my energy just for you?Don't make me laugh. You're giving yourself far too much credit."



Her tone,velvet-smooth and edged with quiet derision, sliced straight through Brendon's battered ego. He bristled, but the sting in her words gnawed at him.



Still clinging to denial, Brendon pressed on, his
voice taut with frustration. "How much longer are you going to keep up this act? What is it you actually want from me,Christina?"



Deep down, he was praying she'd admit she still wanted him.



But Christina simply delivered a cool command."Get lost."



Jaw tight,Brendon replied stubbornly, "I'll leave.But not until you bring out those 'servants' you have hired for this house."



He wanted to catch her in a lie, to prove that she hadn't chosen some supposed sugar daddy over him, and she had been faithful to him during their marriage.



Before Christina could fire back at his nerve, the doors swept open. A procession of women filed in,each one dressed in crisp, identical uniforms.



At their head strode a stately woman, dignified in her fifties, flanked by ten younger women whose expressions betrayed not a hint of emotion.



With everyone frozen in disbelief, the group of women stepped forward, forming a protective
barrier in front of Christina.



Every woman stood tall,hands folded gracefully at their waists, posture flawless and unyielding.Their uniforms, plain and spotless, exuded a quiet authority, and not a single detail was out of place-not even their perfectly manicured nails.



In unison, they dipped their heads in a polished bow. "Good day, Miss Jones," they chorused,voices clear and respectful.



Brendon's jaw dropped as their smooth coordination and refined bearing unfolded.These weren't ordinary servants-they looked like the kind of staff only the city's most powerful families could afford. Was Christina actually connected to the legendary Hubbard family?



The thought flashed through Brendon's mind,only for him to scoff at himself a second later.The Hubbard family was obsessed with their image. No way would they welcome a divorced woman, no matter how impressive her facade.No way. Christina probably just hired a team of professional actors. He had to admit that their performance was convincing,but not enough to shake his certainty.
Relief swept over Brendon, easing the tight knot of suspicion in his chest. A faint, self-assured smile played at his lips as he watched Christina keep up her "charade."



Stepping forward, the stately woman, Aylin Chadwick, kept her head slightly bowed, her voice steady and deferential as she addressed Christina, "Miss Jones,we have been assigned to serve you from this day forward. I'll be your head housekeeper-should you need anything,please don't hesitate to ask."



Christina gave a subtle, dismissive smile."Alright. Nothing much for now. You may go now."



She watched the servants file out in perfect silence,marveling at Dylan's attention to detail -he'd even arranged an entire staff for her,though eleven people felt downright extravagant.



Once the last uniformed servant vanished through the door, Brendon lunged forward,seizing Christina's wrist in a bruising grip.



Christina's eyes flicked down at his hand, her gaze turning sharp and frosty. "Let go of me,"
she stated, her voice flat and glacial.



Brendon ignored her protest, suspicion curling around every word. "So these 'servants' of yours... What are they, hired actors you picked up for the day?"



She didn't flinch. "I'll say it one last time. Let go."Each syllable dripped with chill, daring him to defy her.



His hand trembled for a second-some old fear flickering behind his eyes-but then he doubled down,fingers digging in tighter. "Why can't you just admit you're putting on a show? Why keep pretending?"



Brendon searched Christina's face, desperate for some hint of surrender, his brows drawn tightly. All he wanted was for her to bow her head and admit defeat. But she just stared him down, her stubbornness every bit as unyielding as his own.



He couldn't get it. Christina used to fold the second he frowned at her, scrambling to please him at the slightest sign of annoyance. Now,she was someone else entirely-a stranger who no longer bent to his will.
From across the room, Yolanda watched the standoff, her stomach knotting with jealousy.She had never truly loved Brendon, not in the way stories described, but seeing him so obsessed with another woman made something inside her twist and ache. Brendon's incessant interrogation only revealed how deeply he still cared for Christina, whether he'd admit it or not.



Yolanda was slightly uneasy. She couldn't lose Brendon-not now. Not to Christina. Not after everything. Her nails dug into her palms as she clenched her fists, fury simmering just beneath the surface. Christina wouldn't steal her future.Not this time. Just wait. One day, she would make Christina disappear from this world entirely. And anyone foolish enough to stand in her way would face a reckoning they'd never forget.



"I'm warning you. This is your last chance-let me go." Christina's voice remained cool and level, but the threat beneath her words was unmistakable. She stood perfectly still, her icy gaze fixed on Brendon, daring him to test her.



Brendon met her glare with a stubborn defiance."And if I don't? What are you going to do?"
A frosty chuckle slipped from Christina's lips. "If you're so desperate to find out, don't blame me for what happens next."



Before Brendon could react, the doors burst open and a squad of armed men swept into the room with military precision, forming a tight perimeter around them. "Don't move! Hands in the air-now!"



The glint of cold steel and the unwavering aim of their weapons left no doubt-one wrong move and it would all be over in an instant.
###Chapter 65 Police Station
Brendon's legs nearly gave out beneath him,his heart thundering in panic-until he spotted the uniforms. Police officers. He exhaled sharply in relief. So, Finnegan really had called the police.For a second, he thought they were done for.



One officer stepped forward, his voice firm and official. "We received a report about a suspected criminal gang posing a public threat in this area. Please cooperate and come with us.You have the right to remain silent-but anything you say may be used against you in court. Who made the report?"



"I did!" Finnegan raised his hand high. "I was the one!" He jabbed a finger toward Christina and the muscular men flanking her. "It's them! They attacked us! Tried to strangle us to death-look at our necks!" He tugged at his collar, revealing the red marks like a badge of honor. "This is attempted murder!"



Katie jumped in, eager to play the victim. "I can back that up!" she said, holding her head high as she turned to show the red welts on her skin."I
was this close to dying! They attacked us like savages!"



Joselyn and Sheila quickly followed suit,revealing similar bruises and chiming in with exaggerated gasps and dramatic retellings, all meant to paint Christina as a monster.



Yolanda's eyes shimmered with tears, her hand drifting to her neck. Though it looked like she was trying to cover the marks, she was actually revealing them just enough to be noticed.



Brendon remained silent. As a man, the shame of being lifted by the throat like a helpless puppet was unbearable. The memory made his stomach turn-but he said nothing, refusing to admit the humiliation.



The officer glanced over them all, his expression unreadable. "All of you will need to come with us for further investigation."



Christina let out a slow breath. She looked utterly unfazed. "Alright," she said coolly. "Let's get this over with."



Without another word, she walked forward,the others following behind as the officers escorted them away.
Not far away, hidden in the shadows, a sleek black business car sat parked.



"Mr. Scott," the driver said quietly. "Miss Jones has been taken by the police."



Dylan simply hummed in response.



"Should we intervene?" the driver asked cautiously.



Dylan's expression remained unreadable. "Not for now."



"Alright." The driver offered no further comment.He had served Dylan for years. And if there was one thing he knew for certain, it was that Dylan never acted without a plan.



"To the police station," Dylan instructed calmly,closing his eyes as he leaned back in his seat.He had a gut feeling that Christina didn't need his intervention this time. She could handle everything herself.



The car slid into a shadowed corner near the police station, its matte-black body blending seamlessly into the darkness.
Meanwhile, inside the police station, the initial questioning had wrapped up. The servants had already been cleared and released.



Brendon turned toward Christina,his expression a strange mix of sternness and something gentler-almost pity. "If you apologize and admit fault," he said quietly, "I'll drop the charges. No need to drag this out."



Christina tilted her head, unimpressed."Apologize? For what exactly? I didn't do anything wrong."



Brendon's brow tightened. "Why are you so stubborn? I'm trying to help you. If this goes further, you could end up in detention. I'm offering you a way out."



Her eyes narrowed slightly, her voice cold."How generous of you."



Before Brendon could reply, Katie cut in with sharp disdain. "Brendon, seriously? Stop trying to help her! You're not her husband anymore.The woman you should be thinking about is Yolanda-not some fickle slut who cheated on you!"
"Shut up, Katie!" Brendon snapped, his face flushing with anger. The mention of being cuckolded in public was a slap to his pride. His face darkened with fury.



Katie bit her lip and backed down, though her glare said she wasn't finished.



With a fake attempt to smooth things over,Yolanda stepped forward, her voice soft and reasonable. "Let's not escalate this, Christina.Just apologize and take responsibility. We really don't want this to get uglier than it already is."



Christina gave a slow, mocking smile. "How thoughtful." Then, with an almost playful glint in her eye,she reached into her pocket.



Christina's actions sent a ripple of unease through Brendon and the others. They tensed.A wave of dread prickled across their skin as if Christina were about to unveil something that would shatter the fragile narrative they'd built.
###Chapter 66 HHis Chest Tightened At The Sight O...
"What's that supposed to mean?" Yolanda asked, her tone laced with caution.



Christina lowered her head slightly, a faint smile tugging at her lips. But beneath the smile, her posture betrayed something else-grief,resignation, and a flicker of fear. "It means," she said quietly, "I plan to make things very difficult for you."



Christina slowly pulled out her phone and added with a calm, almost playful menace, "In fact,I'm going to blow this up-loudly, publicly, and dramatically."



Katie's eyes flicked toward Christina's phone,her expression tightening. "What are you getting at?" she asked, her voice cold and wary.



Christina's smile faded. Her expression hardened as her eyes reddened with sudden emotion. She held the phone close, clutching it as if it was a lifeline. "Don't act innocent. I've got video proof. Clear evidence you threw the first punch.
It's all right here. And the police-" She paused,her voice dropping to a sharp whisper. "They care about evidence, not stories. You're done for."



As soon as Christina finished speaking,Katie and the others finaly realized they were in trouble.



"You little snake!" Katie shouted, lunging toward Christina."Hand your damnedphoneover-now!"



Christina jerked back. Finnegan and Sheila sprang into action beside Katie. All three charged forward. They couldn't let Christina keep that phone. If the footage got out, they were ruined.



"No!" Christina screamed, her voice cracking as she stumbled backward, as if she was truly frightened. "Let go of me! Help-please!They're trying to snatch my phone! Someone help me!"



To anyone watching, Christina looked like a terrified victim being attacked-helpless,pleading, and vulnerable. But underneath the chaos, she wasn't as fragile as she appeared.Her elbows found ribs. Her heels struck shins.She fought back with unexpected strength,catching the three off guard.
Grunts of pain escaped from the three as they flinched, staggered, and gasped for breath.Despite outnumbering Christina, they were on the receiving end of her attack.



"Enough!" A female police officer pushed through the fray, grabbing Katie by the arm and pulling her back.



More officers rushed in, forming a barrier between Christina and her "attackers."



Christina stumbled back and hid behind the officer.Her shoulders trembled as she clung to her phone. Tears streamed down her cheeks,and her hair fell in tangled waves around her face. Even in her disarray, there was something devastatingly beautiful about her vulnerability.



Brendon stood frozen nearby, unable to look away. He had never seen Christina like this-so fragile.Seeing her cowering behind the female officer, her face pale with terror, something inside him snapped. An overwhelming need to protect her surged through him. Every tear that rolled down her cheeks felt like a dagger to his heart.



Christina's disheveled hair, the way she seemed
to fold into herself, and the silent sobs escaping her lips struck Brendon with unbearable regret and sympathy. And it wasn't just Brendon who felt it. Even the officers around her couldn't help but soften, their expressions shifting to sympathy.



Now,when the officers turned their attention to the trio who had "attacked" Christina, their eyes were hard, judging, and disapproving. To them,the three no longer looked like victims of a scuffle but predators caught in the act.



"What just happened?" the female officer turned and asked, looking into Christina's eyes.Her tone had softened the moment she saw Christina flinch. "You're safe now. Don't be afraid. Just tell us what happened-we're here to help."



Christina slowly looked up, her eyes red and swollen from crying. After a moment's hesitation, she reached into her pocket and shakily handed the phone to the officer. "Th-this has the proof," she stammered. "They came at me... They tried to take it. I-I thought they were going to kill me."



Her voice cracked, and a choked sob escaped.She covered her mouth with a trembling hand,
seemingly sruggling to breathe. "I begged them to stop..." she whispered, her voice barely audible. "But they wouldn't. They just kept trying to rip it from me."



Earlier, when Christina was brought in for formal questioning, she didn't say much. She sat stiffly, hands clasped in her lap, her entire demeanor that of a fragile woman holding on by a thread.



But what the others didn't see was how meticulously Christina had orchestrated all of this. Earlier, when she had smiled at Brendon and the others, it was never in front of a camera. She had avoided direct angles, tilting her face just so, keeping her most calculated expressions hidden from view. Even when Brendon had grabbed her by the neck back in the house, she hadn't fought back. She had allowed it to happen so that it could be captured on video.




Christina had warned them before: if they didn't provoke her, she wouldn't go after them. But they'd ignored that wvarning. And now? They had no one to blame but themselves.
###Chapter 67 Haven't You Learned Your Lesson
Christina passed her phone to the female officer without a word and then backed away, her face stricken with a convincing act of fear so raw that it could've fooled anyone.


Katie didn't react at first. She stood still,breathing heavily. But as the reality of the situation hit her, fury bubbled up and she lunged forward. Yet, restrained by the officer,she couldn't get any closer to Christina.Her hands clenched into fists. Then, she lifted her foot and kicked in Christina's direction, not caring who saw. "You conniving witch! You tricked us! Stop pretending!"



Katie belatedly realized she had been outsmarted by Christina. All that boldness Christina flaunted earlier had vanished. Now,Christina looked like some fragile victim, eyes
lowered, shoulders shaking-completely transformed, hoping people would pity her. It was disgusting. The gall of this woman. Faking it all like she deserved an Oscar.


What Katie didn't see was the effect her outburst had on the watching officers. Every shout. Every wild movement. It just made Christina seem more like the wounded one.



Moreover, Christina had proof. Real, solid evidence. She hadn't started the mess-Katie and the others had.



By the time the officers finished their investigation, they handed down fines and a strict verbal warning to everyone involved.Finnegan was detained for a few days as punishment for filing false police reports.



Except for Finnegan, the rest of the group was released.
Once outside the police station, Yolanda broke down and ran into Brendon's arms, sobbing like her chest might cave in. "Brendon, what do we
do now? My dad didn't mean for this to happen..." Her voice cracked, full of panic.


Sheila stood off to the side, face pale. "It was just a harmless lie," she said quietly. "Did the officers really need to take it that far? Locking Finnegan up over that?"


"Christina's the reason we got hit with those fines! If she hadn't pulled that stunt, we wouldn't have been in this mess!" Katie snapped, her voice shaking with rage.


Joselyn crossed her arms and sneered, "Lucky thing our Dawson family had the sense to cut her off when we did. That bitch's cursed-she would've dragged all of us down."


Yolanda sniffled, seizing the moment to make her appear gentle and understanding. "It's not all on Christina. She was just looking out for herself... She had her reasons. But my dad..."Her words gave way to sobs before she could finish.



Brendon glanced at Yolanda, taking in the tears
trailing down her face. But it wasn't her he saw.Instead, his mind wandered back to Christina's tearful image. He wasn't even sure if it was Yolanda or Christina that his chest tightened for.


"Don't worry. I'll find a way to get your father out," Brendon said to Yolanda, his voice steady.


Really?" Yolanda blinked up at him, her eyes red and swollen.



Yes." Brendon reached out and brushed her tears away with his thumb. "Come on. Let's head home."



But even while the words left his mouth, he wasn't fully present. That look on Christina's face-so raw, so shaken-it wouldn't leave him.Christina had always struck him as tough. The kind of woman who didn't crumble. But today,she did. And it wasn't an act. She must have been genuinely terrified.


While the group continued their chatter,Brendon stayed silent. Every step he took was haunted by that moment-Christina's trembling,
tear-filled eyes burned into his memory.


Suddenly, Katie's voice rang out, slicing through Brendon's drifting thoughts like a slap to the face."Stop right there!"


The shout rang loud and fierce, but Christina didn't even flinch. She kept walking, completely unfazed.



Driven by a surge of anger, Katie charged ahead and threw herself in front of Christina, cutting off her path.


Christina frowned, her gaze sharp and unyielding. "Haven't you learned your lesson?"


Shaking with fury, Katie stood her ground.Her expression clouded over, and her hands clenched at her sides. "You think you can take us on? Without backup, you're nobody!"


"Step aside," Christina commanded with a chilling calm.


"No. You're going back to the police station,and you're going to make sure they let
Yolanda's dad out. Right now," Katie demanded,lifting her chin defiantly.


"That man means nothing to me. Why would I bother getting involved? If you're really that worried about him, maybe you should go sit in that cell for him," Christina retorted. She folded her arms and stared at Katie like she was a complete fool.


Seething,Sheila stomped forward and jabbed a finger at Christina. "You're such a scheming bitch! You fooled everyone at the police station,crying like you were really terrified. Your audacity and shamelessness astounded me!"
###Chapter 68 He Collapsed
Christina's lips curled into a cold smile as her eyes briefly flicked from Sheila to Yolanda, who clung to Brendon like a delicate porcelain doll.


A slow, mocking smile tugged at Christina's lips."How generous of you," she said smoothly to Sheila."Though I must admit, your daughter's far better at playing the damsel in distress than l ever could be."



Sheila's expression darkened, her fury boiling over as she lifted her hand to slap Christina.


But Christina caught her wrist midair without flinching.


Katie immediately surged forward to help Sheila, only for Christina to twist Sheila's arm and shove Sheila straight into Katie's path. A loud thud followed.



"Ahh!"
"Ouch-watch it!"



The two crashed to the ground, limbs tangled,with Sheila landing hard on top of Katie.



"Mom!"



"Katie!"



Yolanda and Joselyn hurried to help Katie and Sheila, panic and worry etched across their faces as they struggled to lift Katie and Sheila off the ground.


Brendon stepped toward Christina, anger flickering in his eyes. "Why do you always have to escalate things? Can't you just let it go for once?"



Christina folded her arms, her gaze cool and unbothered. "Maybe if you paid more attention,you'd see who really started it."


"Must you always use that annoying tone to talk to me?" he snapped.


She offered a slow, biting smile. "Of course.
How else I am going to slice through the nonsense around here?"



He stared at her, trying to rein in the frustration burning in his chest. "Does it always have to be war between us?" he asked finally. "We could try... I don't know, at least being civil for once."


Christina tilted her head, voice calm but cutting."Sure. Just keep your entourage in check. l don't start fights-I finish them."


"You started this mess!" Katie shouted,brushing herself off.


Brendon took a step closer, his voice low and firm. "Don't test me, Christina. I'm trying to be reasonable, but you keep pushing it."①


"Oh? Is that all you have to say? If there's nothing else, then leave. Stop wasting my time,"Christina said, turning slightly away.


Brendon's jaw tightened as anger boiled beneath the surface. He'd never found her so infuriating. "You really want to go down this
road?" he said quietly. "Because if you do,won't hesitate to tell the Jones family about the kind of company you've been keeping."


Christina's smile vanished. Her eyes darkened as she whipped around. "Do it," she said,voice low and calm. "Tell them. But don't think for a second that I'm scared of your threats."


Brendon stared at her for a long moment before replying, his voice cold and calculated, "You might not care about your own reputation, but dragging your family into this? Think very carefully, Christina. Some stains never wash off."
"Stay out of my business, Brendon!" Christina snapped, reaching out to shove him out of her way.


But to her shock, before she could make any contact, Brendon stumbled backward-his balance faltering-before his eyes rolled back and he crumpled to the ground.


His head struck the ground with a sickening
thud. The impact tore through the bandage on the back of his skull, and blood began to soak through, vivid and alarming.



Brendon didn't even flinch. He was already unconscious before the pain could catch up to him.



"Brendon!" Joselyn cried out in panic, rushing to his side. Her face turned pale at the sight of the spreading red stain. "Oh my God-he's bleeding! He's bleeding!"



Katie shrieked, her voice rising in alarm,"Someone call an ambulance! Now!"


"I-I'm calling!" Yolanda fumbled with her phone, her fingers trembling. Her eyes brimmed with fear. With her father incustody and her family's company teetering on collapse,Brendon had become her last thread of hope.



Sheila pointed a shaking finger at Christina, her voice quivering with fury. "You monster! Look at him! This is your doing!"
Christina crossed her arms, unbothered. "Are you serious right now? I didn't even touch him.He fell on his own."


"Don't try to weasel out of this!" Sheila barked."This is your fault. You're paying for this-you won't leave until you do!"


Sheila stormed toward Christina, hand outstretched to grab her.


But before Sheila could get close, the deep growl of an engine cut through the chaos. A sleek black business car rolled up beside them.


The doors opened, and three tall men in black suits stepped out. They were broad-shouldered,stone-faced, and radiated quiet menace. Their sharp eyes swept the scene, making it instantly clear-they weren't just any men. They were professional bodyguards.


Sheila froze, her outstretched hand retreating instinctively.


Katie and Yolanda exchanged uneasy glances.
Who were these men? Were they here for Christina?



The three men approached Christina, stopped in front of her, and bowed in perfect unison."Miss Jones," they said in low, respectful tones.


Katie, Yolanda, and Sheila felt their stomachs twist as the realization sank in. These men were Christina's people.


One of the bodyguards stepped forward,his voice calm and assertive. "We've come to escort you home, Miss Jones."


Christina gave a small nod. "Alright. Let's go."


But before leaving, she turned back to the trio with a smirk dancing on her lips. She lifted her hand and wiggled her fingers in a mocking wave. "Try not to miss me too much," she said,her tone light but dripping with sarcasm.


Katie, Yolanda, and Sheila seethed in silence,their eyes locked on Christina's retreating figure. But none of them dared to move. None
of them had the courage to speak up-especially not with those intimidating men around. Each of those bodyguards looked strong enough to knock someone out with a single blow.


Christina stepped into the sleek black car, and within moments, it pulled away, vanishing down the street.



Leaning back in the seat, Christina closed her eyes and let out a deep breath, a satisfied smile on her lips. Yolanda might be good at playing the victim, but she could play that game, too-better, even. After all, life was nothing but a stage. And she had learned how to play her part perfectly.







At Bayview Estates, Christina stood in front of the three bodyguards who had brought her home and a line of ten uniformed servants."Thank you for your service," she said warmly."And please extend my deepest gratitude to Mr.
Scott for arranging this on such short notice.I'll be sure to thank him in person when time permits. You may all leave now."


Without hesitation, the entire line of personnel bowed in perfect unison.
###Chapter 69 Loyalty
The bodyguards, rigid and unreadable just moments before, now quaked with unease.


Aylin stepped forward, bowing to Christina."Miss Jones, we were all assigned by Mr. Scott to serve you. If you let us go, we'll all lose our jobs...


Please, don't turn us away! Without this job, I don't know how my family will survive. My husband's illness is rare-the medication costs a fortune, and it's only available overseas. If I'm fired, my family will fall apart. My daughter's always been devoted, and she'd never walk out on me or my husband, but I don't want to be a burden to her..."



Tears streaming, Aylin added, "Miss Jones, I'm begging you-give me any task, no matter how hard. Just let me work for you."


A chorus of desperate voices echoed her plea.
"Please, Miss Jones, don't dismiss us! We nave nowhere to go-we're pleading with you..."


One by one, the household staff spilled their stories, each more heartbreaking than the last.Every family seemed to be hanging by a thread.If their words held any truth, losing this job would destroy them.


Still, the coincidence nagged at Christina-could every one of them truly be so desperate?A crease formed between her brows. "That's not going to happen. If you leave here, you won't be out of work. Weren't you all Scott family staff to begin with? If you go back to provide service, I'm sure the Scott family will take you back. Why would you end up unemployed?"


Aylin's voice trembled, eyes growing glossy."Miss Jones, it's not that simple. Once the Scott family sends someone away to serve elsewhere,there's no going back. If we're not needed anymore, it's as if we've been banished for qood.The pay offered by the Scott family is the
highest we'll ever see, and after working here,no other rich family would trust us-they'd think we're spies or have our own agenda. Landing another decent job just isn't possible."


Christina considered the Scott family's rigid structure. She'd always known they were strict,but she hadn't realized the rules were this unforgiving. Still, for a family wielding such influence, it fit. Even among relatives, rivalries ran deep-if siblings could turn on each other,what chance did outsiders have? The Scott family's oppressive rules were nothing new.Their relentless vigilance was likely the very reason they'd managed to maintain their power for generations.


Even so, Christina had no intention of keeping so many people around-especially when she had no plans to live here for long. This mansion wasn't truly hers, just a place she used to show to Brendon and his crew that she was flourishing on her own.


"Please, Miss Jones, don't take away our only
means of survival!" Aylin pleaded, her tears spilling unchecked down her cheeks.



Moved by their desperation, Christina finally gave in. "Fine. You can stay here for now. I'll talk to Dylan and see if something can be worked out for all of you."


She resolved to try convincing Dylan to bring the staff back into the Scott family's residence.


"Thank you, Miss Jones! We'll give you our absolute best and never betray your trust!" Aylin promised, her gratitude shining through.


"We're grateful for your generosity, Miss Jones!Our loyalty is yours!" the rest of the staff chimed in, their unified voices ringing out with a fierce, almost ceremonial resolve, as if they were reciting an oath in a period drama.



Had Christina been born in another century,she might have mistaken their devotion for the kind that sparked revolutions, ready to charge into battle at her command.
"Go on, you're dismissed for now," Christina said, pinching the bridge of her nose as a dull ache started to build behind her eyes.
She pulled out her phone and dialed Dylan's number, only to be met with a dead line. A flicker of annoyance crossed her face, but she chose not to dwell on it-she'd circle back to it with Dylan when the moment felt right.


Just then, her stomach let out a loud, impatient growl, making her painfully aware she'd skipped breakfast in all the earlier chaos.


Before she could hunt down something to eat, a servant stepped forward, bowing with careful deference. "Miss Jones, there's a visitor outside requesting to see you."
###Chapter 70 Chloe's Condition Worsened
Puzzlement etched itself across Christina's brow. She hadn't been here long-who would be seeking her out already?



Stepping outside, Christina shaded her eyes and tried to make out the figure at the gate.Ralphy stood there, his face a mask of nervousness as he peered into the courtyard.


Before she'd even crossed the courtyard,Ralphy was already calling to her through the gate. "Miss Jones, could you please tell them to open the gate and let me in?"



A bright smile appeared on Christina's face as she nodded at the bodyguard. "Go ahead-let him in."



With a quick salute, the bodyguard complied at once. "Of course, Miss Jones!"
Relief washed over Ralphy as he finally stepped inside, brandishing a takeout container. "Made it! I brought some food for you."


Arching an eyebrow, Christina couldn't resist teasing him, "Why the special delivery, Mr.Graham? You could have sent someone else to do the errand."



A sheepish grin spread across Ralphy's face as he scratched his nose. "Dylan had to rush off to a meeting, so he ordered me to deliver it myself."


She let out a light laugh. "I suppose I should count myself lucky to be fussed over by the two of you." Her invitation was immediate. "If you're hungry,you might as well join me for lunch."


Instantly, Ralphy's eyes lit up and he nodded with exaggerated enthusiasm. "Absolutely!haven't eaten a thing all day!"


Catching sight of Dylan preparing a meal for Christina, Ralphy's hunger had flared-and without missing a beat, he quickly offered to
handle the delivery. This clever move gave him the perfect excuse to stick around at Christina's place, ensuring he'd get a taste of that mouthwatering food himself.


Christina's eyebrows shot up in mild disbelief."Dylan actually cooked all this himself?"


Without missing a beat, Ralphy replied,"Naturally. That man's gone out of his way for you,Miss Jones."



A thoughtful look crossed Christina's face."Then I'll need to find a way to thank him for the gesture."



Ralphy shook his head, already prying open the containers. "No thanks necessary. You're the reason Chloe has a fighting chance-if anything,the Scott family owes you. Hope is back in our house because of you."



She settled into her seat at the table. "Any idea when he'll be finished with work?"


Ralphy gave a shrug, glancing at the clock. "No
idea. He's a workaholic-it could go on until late."



"Alright," Christina said quietly, leaving the conversation to drift away.


It didn't take long before Ralphy, unable to hide his ravenous hunger, made quick work of every dish.



Wiping his mouth, Ralphy grinned from ear to ear. "You know, if it weren't for you, I'd never get a bite of food this good."


Christina responded with a gentle smile, "I'm glad you enjoyed it."



Ralphy just opened his mouth to speak when his phone began to buzz insistently. "Sorry, let me grab this." He then answered without delay."Hello?"



All the mischief drained from his features in a heartbeat, replaced by stark worry. Panic crept into his voice. "What do you mean? What happened to Chloe?"
Christina's heart skipped a beat, her own concern instantly showing on her face.


The moment Ralphy ended the call, Christina leaned in, her tone urgent. "What's going on with Chloe?"



Ralphy's answer was grim. "She suddenly went blind. They've already rushed her to the hospital."



A worried frown settled across Christina's forehead."We should go right now."



"Let's move." Without hesitation, Ralphy nodded, any trace of lightheartedness replaced by a grim resolve.


Matching his urgency, Christina's brows remained furrowed, her thoughts spinning. She had looked over Chloe's medical history-nothing had pointed to such a rapid decline.


Suddenly, Ralphy broke the silence, anxiety tightening his voice. "Has King been in contact with you at all?"
Christina gave a short nod. "King's been in touch, saying the prescription for Chloe's cure is almost ready and just needs one last ingredient,But..."


Ralphy leaned in, nerves on edge. "But what?What's the problem?"


A moment of hesitation passed before Christina replied, "The last ingredient is a rare find.Tracking it down could take a while."


Ralphy's voice turned sharp, desperate for clarity. "What's the name of this ingredient?"


"Woodfort," Christina answered simply.


The shock was instant. "Woodfort?" Ralphy repeated, almost in disbelief. "That's next to impossible to get. The Scott family once had one,but..."


She finished the thought for him. "But they don't have it anymore?"


Regret colored Ralphy's words. "Exactly." He gripped the steering wheel tightly, recalling the
past. "When I was a kid, I nearly died and needed Woodfort to survive. Because my family and the Scott family were close, Dylan's grandfather gave his family's only piece to my grandfather. It saved me, but now..."


Self-reproach pressed down on him, his jaw clenched. "If it weren't for me, Chloe might have already been getting the treatment she needed."



"You can't shoulder all that blame. It was a life-or-death decision. Your family and the Scott family have always stood by each other-no one would have let you die," Christina said softly,trying to comfort him.


Emotion thickened Ralphy's voice. "Still... I can't help but feel like I stole Chloe's hope with my own survival."



A wave of dread washed over Ralphy, the fear of losing Chloe gnawing at his every thought. The idea that her life might slip away because of him haunted him, a torment he knew he could never
escape. If Chloe didn't survive-if her death was somehow his fault-it would break him in ways he couldn't begin to describe.


Christina's voice was soft, a gentle attempt at reassurance. "Try not to let your worries consume you-sometimes, fate finds a way."


Ralphy said nothing in return. The silence in the car thickened as he slammed his foot down on the accelerator, desperate to close the distance to the hospital. Every second that passed tightened the knot of anxiety in his chest, a constant terror that they might arrive too late.King had given them hope-a promise that Chloe could be cured. Yet now, everything felt as if it was slipping through their fingers.


The instant they reached the hospital, both Ralphy and Christina hurried down the corridor not wasting a moment.


Ralphy's voice cracked with urgency as he flagged down Morse. "What's happening? Tell me,how is Chloe? Where can I find her?"
###Chapter 71 Self-blame
Morse's arm was pinned in a bruising grip,making him clench his jaw against the pain."Chloe's been taken for an examination," he said, his voice grave and measured.



Outwardly, Morse looked composed, but inside,his nerves were shot and his thoughts spun out of control. Behind the gleam of his gold-rimmed glasses, worry churned in eyes usually known for their kindness. His palms were slick with sweat, a cold dread creeping through his veins,though no one around him noticed.


"What did the doctor say? How did she lose her sight so suddenly?" Ralphy asked, his voice taut.



"They still don't have an answer. Everything's uncertain right now. Chloe said she took a bad fall yesterday and hit her head, but we don't know if that's the reason," Morse said,his tone
flat and icy.


At that moment, Dylan strode in, a sense of urgency radiating from him.


Ralphy turned to Dylan. "Did Chloe ever mention falling or hitting her head?"


"No," Dylan answered, jaw tight and hands balled into fists. "She was in great spirits at lunch."


Earlier, while preparing Christina's meal, Dylan had whipped up all of Chloe's favorite dishes as well. At that time, Chloe had been energetic and chatty, trailing after him and begging to move to live with Christina. She had pestered him endlessly, but he'd stood his ground and turned her down. Now, the memory gnawed at him.Maybe he'd at least run it by Christina instead of shutting Chloe down so quickly. A wave of regret washed over him-he wished he'd taken Chloe's request seriously, instead of dismissing her outright.


"She probably brushed it off as nothing serious,
not wanting to alarm us," Ralphy said, his voice heavy with emotion. Anxiety consumed him as he worried for Chloe, but couldn't do anything.



The bitter ache of frustration crept over Ralphy,each moment feeding his building self-reproach. "If I hadn't used the Scott family's Woodfort, Chloe could've started treatment already," he remarked, regret threading through every word.



"What do you mean?" Morse asked, his tone sharp.



Dylan's gaze shifted to Ralphy, a faint crease deepening between his brows.



"King reached out to Miss Jones, saying that the prescription's nearly complete, but one ingredient is still missing: Woodfort." Ralphy clarified quietly.



Morse's brow tightened, suspicion flickering in his eyes. "Woodfort's practically unheard of.Most people don't even know it exists."
"Exactly," Ralphy said, the weight of self-blame bearing down on him. "If I hadn't used the sole and only Woodfort of the Scott family, it could've been used to treat Chloe right now."


"Don't talk like that. Back then,the Scott family wouldn't have stood by, not when your condition had been dire. Even if we'd kept the Woodfort,we would have used it for whoever needed it most," Dylan replied, giving Ralphy's shoulder a firm, reassuring pat.


Ralphy swallowed hard, emotion tightening his throat. He gripped Dylan's hand in silent gratitude, eyes shining.


"There's no point dwelling on what-ifs.We'll just wait for King's update," Christina said, keeping her tone steady and composed. She was eager to check on Chloe. If anything changed for the worse, the Woodfort might be useless, and another prescription could become necessary.The thought that Chloe's illness might spiral beyond anyone's help haunted her, a fear that no medicine would be enough if it got out of
control.



Soon, Chloe was transferred to a ward,flanked by the doctor and nurse who had handled her examination.
###Chapter 72 Chloe's Condition
The doctor delivered the news that Chloe's condition had taken a turn for the worse. The brain tumor was now pressing against her optic nerve, causing episodes of temporary blindness. Even after the temporary blindness faded, her vision remained blurry, eventually leading to complete blindness.



If the tumor had been in a safer location,surgery might have saved her. Her chances of recovery could have been high. But the tumor's position made everything more complicated. It was dangerously close to critical areas of the brain, making the operation nearly impossible.Even the most experienced surgeons were hesitant, their hands tied by the risks involved.On the operating table, Chloe's chances of surviving were heartbreakingly low.



Yet, without surgery, the doctors said she might only live another six months-or a year if lucky.
And if her health declined suddenly, she might not even live to see the next day. There was no way to predict what might happen.



After explaining everything and giving a few instructions, the doctor and nurse quietly stepped out of the room.


The silence that followed was heavy. No one spoke. All eyes turned to Chloe. She sat calmly,her gaze unfocused. Wrapped in a blanket of darkness, she couldn't seethe walls, the light,or the faces around her.



Ralphy looked at her pale face and lifeless eyes.Her lips were dry, her skin fragile. But still, she smiled. That smile tore something inside him. It made his chest ache with sympathy and concern.



"Why is everyone so quiet?" Chloe asked softly,a faint smile on her lips. She reached out,her hands searching the air around her. "Where are you all?"



Her eyes were blank but strangely peaceful.
The soft curve of her smile was both beautiful and heartbreaking.



Christina stepped forward quickly, gently wrapping her fingers around Chloe's wrist.


"Hmm... Small hands," Chloe said, tilting her head. "That must be Christina, right?" A laugh escaped her lips. "Did I guess right? I'm kind of amazing, aren't l?"


Her voice was brighter now, trying to cut through the sadness hanging in the room.


Though she couldn't see their faces, she could feel their emotions-and she wanted to comfort them. She didn't want those she loved to be sad. More than anything, she wanted them to be happy. Even if she couldn't escape death,she hoped those she cared about would live joyful,fulfilling lives.


Christina smiled. "Yes, Chloe. You're really amazing."



Christina lifted her hand as if to pat Chloe's
head gently, but in truth, she was quietly checking Chloe's condition.


"What about the others?" Chloe asked with a gentle smile, tilting her head slightly. Her vacant eyes were fixed on a spot in the room."Why isn't anyone saying anything?" She had heard voices earlier from that direction, so she guessed they were all standing there.


"We're right here," Ralphy replied, trying his best to keep his voice calm.


"You will be fine. Nothing will happen to you,"Dylan said firmly, his voice steady.


"That's right," Morse chimed in. "King's almost done preparing the medicine. Soon, you'll be able to see the world again-its colors, its beauty."


Chloe's smile deepened, but her voice turned wistful. "Speaking of which, I suddenly want to see the ocean. Snow-covered mountains.Waterfalls. Even the aurora." She paused."There's still so much I haven't seen."
In truth, fear was curling up inside her.What if she never got to see those things and taste her favorite foods again? But she refused to show her fear. She didn't want the people she loved to worry. So, she masked her anxiety with a soft smile and steady voice.


"Dylan," Chloe said softly, "I want to eat your cooking again."



A warm smile spread across Dylan's face."Anything you want. Just name it, and I'll make it for you."


Chloe folded her arms wwith a proud huff. "Well,at least this illness comes with one perk-l get pampered like a queen."


Dylan frowned a little, his tone shifting."Chloe..."



She grinned, sticking out her tongue playfully."Relax, I'm only joking! Don't take everything SO seriously."


Still smiling, she reached out slowly, searching
for Christina's hand. "Christina..."



A pair of soft, warm hands wrapped gently around Chloe's. "I'm here," Christina whispered.


Chloe giggled. "I have a small favor to ask if it's not too much trouble."
###Chapter 73 When Do You PlanTo Marry Me
Christina reached out and gently took Chloe's hand. "Come on, just tell me," she said, her voice quiet.



A bashful grin appeared on Chloe's face. "I've been thinking... Well, would you mind if I moved in with you? Is that okay?"



Knowing she might not have much time ahead,Chloe longed to stay as close to Christina as she could. If her fate was truly sealed, she figured she might as well help bring her brother and Christina together before saying goodbye.


Looking into Chloe's unfocused eyes, Christina could feel the hope radiating from Chloe,making it nearly impossible to turn her down.


Silence hung in the air for a heartbeat, and then Christina's lips curled into a smile. "Of course
you can. But there's one thing..."


Chloe's eyes lit up. "What is it?" she asked."Whatever house rules you have in mind,Christina, I'll go along with them. No complaints."



Laughter escaped Christina. "It's not really about house rules. I just need to occupy your brother's seaside villa a bit longer."



Christina's agreement stemmed from one simple reason: living together would allow her to keep an eye on Chloe's condition more easily.She figured that once Chloe was better, she'd pack up and move out.



With a playful glance at Dylan, Christina teased,"Mr. Scott, you've got more estates than you need. Granting me to stay in one of them for a while shouldn't be too much trouble, should it?"



Dylan chuckled. "Take your pick. Any house you want is yours."


In Dylan's mind, when it came to Chloe,
Christina had already done so much that offering a roof over her head hardly seemed like a big gesture.


Flashing a grin, Christina said, "You never fail to impress. Your generosity knows no bounds."


Ralphy couldn't resist chiming in, "Miss Jones,I'm generous too. Name the property, and it's yours."


Chloe tilted her chin, and a huff escaped her lips. "Christina doesn't need your offer, Ralphy.Dylan, give Christina a prime piece of real estate."



With a teasing smirk, Ralphy replied, "Maybe your brother ought to toss in a helicopter while he's at it."



Morse adjusted his glasses, a hint of mischief in his tone. "How about adding a yacht? Every seaside home needs one."



Bursting into laughter, Chloe squeezed Christina's hand. "Honestly, Christina, why don't
you just marry Dylan? You'd walk away with half his fortune, and he'd still have more money than he could ever spend. Besides, nobody hustles like he does..."



Before she could go on, Dylan's voice broke through, stern and direct. "That's enough,Chloe."



A worried glance shot from Dylan to Christina,bracing himself in case she took offense.



To his surprise, Christina's laughter filled the room, and she replied without missing a beat,"How could I turn down someone who checks every box-tall, handsome, and loaded?"


With a twinkle in her eye, Christina turned to Dylan and asked, "So, Mr. Scott, when do you plan to marry me?"


Her boldness drew laughter from the others,amusement bubbling up around them.


Even though Christina was teasing, her bluntness made color creep up Dylan's cheeks.
For someone usually in control, Dylan suddenly found himself fumbling for a response, caught off guard by her words.


When he opened his mouth to answer, Christina cut in with a playful laugh, "Relax, I'm only messing with you."


Disappointment flickered across Dylan's face,and he forced out a quiet, "It's fine."


Ralphy, quick to sense the tension, interjected,"Let me check with the doctor about when Chloe can be discharged."


Morse jumped in next, ever the thoughtfuI one "Anyone hungry? I can grab us some food and drinks."


Hand shooting up, Chloe grinned. "Coffee for me!"



"Let's check with the doctor first." Turning to Christina and Dylan, Morse asked, "How about you two-need anything?"


Matching Chloe's request, Christina answered,
"Make that two coffees."



"Alright." Morse nodded and shifted his attention to Dylan.


A faint crease formed between Dylan's brows before he finally said, "Coffee for me, too."



"You're not usually a coffee person." Morse started to say, but one look from Dylan made him cut himself off, an awkward grin spreading across his face.



"Got it. I'll be back with your orders," Morse said before heading out. Even as he walked away, he couldn't help but think how rare it was to see Dylan drink coffee.



Ever since Christina came into the picture,Morse had picked up on all sorts of subtle changes in Dylan, as if he were a love-struck teenager taking on changes for his crush.



Once Ralphy and Morse disappeared down the hall, Christina broke the silence. "I appreciate you letting me move my belongings into your
villa-and for playing along."


Dylan offered a simple nod. "Don't mention it."


Christina added, "I'd been considering leaving,but with Chloe wanting to stay close, I guess I'l hang around a little longer before eventually moving out."


Dylan didn't hesitate. "You're welcome to stay as long as you like."


Pausing to gather her thoughts, Christina asked,"Would you mind sending the staff you stationed at the villa back to your family house?"



A hint of frost crept into Dylan's reply. "That's not an option. If you won't have them, they'll lose their jobs altogether."



Brows knitted, Christina asked, "So there's no flexibility here?"


"Absolutely not. Their pay and benefits aren't your concern. My family will take care of all that.But if you turn them away, they will be
unemployed," Dylan replied.


The firmness of his answer left Christina speechless. She recognized that families of the Scotts' stature followed their own code. They had their considerations, and she felt it wasn't her place to protest further.


Curiosity flickered in Dylan's eyes as he asked,"Did the staff do something wrong?"


That brought Christina back from her thoughts,and she responded with a gentle shake of her head, "No, nothing like that. I just prefer managing on my own. I don't need anyone to take care of me..."


"If that's how you feel, then let them go," Dylan said,his voice direct.


Chloe squeezed Christina's hand and whispered, "Let them stay. Anyway, my family will pay for everything. Besides, if you let them go, once I move in, I'll just end up giving you extra work. With the staff around, you won't have to fuss over me."
###Chapter 74 Become Chloe's Caregiver
Unconsciously, Chloe tightened her grip on Christina's hand, her fear quietly showing through. She was terrified of becoming a burden to others. Before, when she had been merely plagued by illness, she could manage by herself. But now, blinded by sudden darkness,so many things felt unreachable, and she had no choice but to ask for help. If she had been blind from birth, she might have learned to live independently by now. But losing her sight so abruptly left her anxious and scared-worried she wouldn't be able to adjust or learn new ways to live.



Being plunged into a world of darkness with nothing but her hands to guide her was terrifying. The panic came in waves, and the unknown always seemed to be waiting just out of reach, cloaked in shadows. She wanted to
stay strong. She really did. But no matter how hard she tried, her fear of the endless blackness slipped through her carefully built courage


Chloe hated the thought of troubling anyone. If the servants stayed on, she wouldn't have to bother Christina, and it would help keep the staff employed,too.


Feeling the pressure of Chloe's tightening grip,Christina looked at her with deep compassion.


"Alright," Christina said softly. "We'll keep the servants. I'll take care of their wages and benefits." She understood all too well the pain of someone who had once seen the light but was now trapped in darkness.


Dylan quickly shook his head. "No, you don't have to worry about that. You've done so much for the Scott family already."


Chloe gave a small smile. "If you're feeling awkward, Christina, then how about this? Once l start seeing a little again, could you go on a trip with me?"
Christina caressed Chloe's hand reassuringly."Sure," she said without hesitation.


Though Christina and Dylan understood what Chloe was really hoping for, no one spoke it aloud. Chloe simply feared she didn't have much time left and longed to see the world's beauty while she still could.


Shifting the gear, Dylan gazed at Christina and asked, "Are you thinking about getting a job?"


Christina shook her head "Not yet. Maybe later."





She had just gone through a divorce and needed time to rest, with no plans to work immediately. Besides, she had enough money to live comfortably. Even if she never worked again, she wouldn't have to worry about the basic necessities. If worse came to worst,selling the sports car she'd won in shooting contests would keep her afloat for a while.



"Why don't you help look after Chloe?" Dylan suggested. "The servants can manage her daily
needs.You just keep her company. I'll pay you a hundred thousand a month plus a bonus at the end of the year."


For most people, Dylan's offer would have felt like a golden opportunity-a dream job handed to them on a silver platter. But Christina, who was already financially independent, didn't feel particularly tempted However, she genuinely enjoyed Chloe's bright and cheerful spirit. That alone was enough reason to say yes



"I don't mind," Christina said with a raised eyebrow and a smile, "but are you really sure you want to pay a hundred thousand a month just for me to keep her company?"


Dylan smiled warmly. "Yes. Knowing you're there puts my mind at ease."


Christina laughed softly. "Well, with a deal like that,how can I refuse? Who doesn't like easy money?"


"That's fantastic!" Chloe exclaimed, her excitement bubbling over. "Now I get to stick to
you,Christina!"


Had Chloe not lost her vision, she would've been bouncing on the hospital bed, too thrilled to sit still.


"Looks like I'm officially Miss Scott's personal caregiver now," Christina said with a playful grin.


Chloe pretended to be offended, turning her head with a mock frown. "Caregiver? Say that again, and I might just stop talking to you!"


"Don't be mad," Christina said with a grin. "We'll just call it that in public to keep the gossip at bay."


Chloe pouted. "I don't care about gossip, but if you do, Christina, I'll listen to you."


"That's my good girl," Christina said, gently patting her head.


Watching them get along so well, Dylan let out a relieved sigh. He gave Chloe a gentle warning not to upset Christina or else he'd send her back to the Scott estate in Lorbridge.
Frightened, Chloe immediately clung to Christina's arm and promised over and over that she would never upset Christina and would always listen to her.
###Chapter 75 Offered To Help
It was just past four in the afternoon when Christina finally stepped out of the hospital room. Dylan had finished his work and arrived to stay with Chloe, giving Christina a chance to leave.



Christina had plans to meet Davina for dinner,and as she walked through the hospital's main lobby, her attention was suddenly drawn to the commotion ahead. A stretcher was being rushed in, and medical staff were moving with urgency. Blood stained the sheets, and a boy was lying unconscious on it.


"Please move aside-emergency case!" a nurse called out as they pushed through the lobby.


A doctor hurried over. "What's the condition of the patient?"



"Severe head trauma," the nurse replied breathlessly. "But that's not the only issue.
Scans showed a brain tumor. It's large. Our chief surgeon refused-said it's too high-risk."


"We don't have time to move him to Lorbridge.If Dr. Emmett doesn't operate soon, this child might not survive."


"But Dr. Emmett needs to catch a flight back right now, so he probably won't have time for the surgery. What about the patient's family?Have they been found?"


"Nothing yet. Should we try checking the director's office? Maybe Dr. Emmett is still around?"



"I doubt it. There's a high-profile patient in Lorbridge scheduled for surgery, and Dr.Emmett's flight back is for that."


As the stretcher passed by, Christina overheard their hurried conversation. Her eyes fell on the boy lying unconscious, his head wrapped in bloody bandages, his pale face smeared with streaks of dried red. A wave of unease swept over her. If anyone could save him, it would be
Calvin.



This hospital was the best in the region, a place where top-tier specialists gathered, and was equipped with the finest facilities. Yet, even here, no surgeons dared take the risk. If they didn't, no other surgeon in other hospitals in the city would either.


Christina paused in her steps, her heart twisting as the boy's bloodied image burned into her mind. That was a young life, and walking away now would feel like ignoring someone who desperately needed help. She wasn't the overly compassionate type, but she couldn't ignore the boy's fate neither. Besides, she had to speak with Calvin anyway about Bethel's surgery. If he were still in the hospital,she could just bring up the boy's condition for him to handle.



Decision made up, Christina turned sharply and walked toward the medical staff, who were waiting for the elevator. She announced firmly,"I'll cover all the child's medical expenses. Do
everything you can to save him."


The medical staff exchanged glances. One of the doctors furrowed his brow, stepping forward with a heavy sigh. "It's not that we don't want to save him," he said quietly, "but right now, we're powerless. All we can do is keep him stable until his family arrives-so they can say their goodbyes."



Christina's voice remained steady. "Didn't you say Dr. Emmett is in the director's office? I'll go get Dr.Emmett myself."


"We appreciate your kindness, but taking on the full financial burden with no guarantee that the family will be grateful isn't something just anyone can afford. If you drain your savings for this child and the child's family refuses to repay you,your money is as well as gone.Besides,Dr.Emmett is probably unreachabole right now.Chasing him might just waste your time."



Sensing Christina's good intentions, the doctor spoke from experience. After all, sometimes,
kindness might be met with ingratitude. These medical staff members still remembered a doctor with a golden heart who once paid a patient's bills out of his own pocket up front for the patient, which the patient's family eventually refused to pay the money back and even almost stabbed the doctor. Working in the hospital,they had grown used to the darker side of humanity. No one could guarantee that every patient's family would be kind and thankful.


Just then, the elevator doors slid open.Christina gave a small smile. "Don't worry. You just focus on doing your best to save the patient. I'll handle everything else."


Saving someone against all odds-this was exactly how Christina always operated. She turned to leave, but then a familiar voice called from behind her, stopping her in her tracks.
###Chapter 76 Kneel Down And Apologize
"Are you medical guys insane? That woman is just a vet. You can't seriously think a vet can save a human life!" Katie's voice sliced through the chaos,thick with mockery and contempt.


Katie planted herself squarely in front of the elevator, blocking the stretcher without the slightest intention of budging.


When Christina pivoted around, she caught the flash of Katie's smug grin, her arms folded in open defiance, making it perfectly clear she had no plans to move aside.


"You moron! Are you trying to get someone killed?" Christina snapped, her patience snapping.


Katie,caught off guard by the blunt insult, let her self-satisfied expression crumble into a scowl."I'm not moving. Whar are you gonna do-fight me?" she retorted n ya'ce bristling with hostility.

"Legal action? Please. Look at her-draped in designer labels, probably worth a fortune, If something happens, she'll just pay out a settlement and walk away without a second thought."


"She's outrageously annoying! If I weren't stuck in this wheelchair, I'd march over there and deliver a thunderous kick."


"Shh! Honey, don't get reckless. We're just regular people. If you get into trouble, we'd have to sell everything just to cover the damages. But for her? Even if she causes a death, any fine would be pocket change."


Katie's head snapped around to the woman in the wheelchair as the word "kick" reached her ears,her glare icy.


Intimidated, the woman's husband quickly spun his wife away from Katie's line of sight, eager to escape any fallout.


Baffled, the woman asked, "Honey, what on earth are you doing? Don't wheel me away! I haven't even seen the end of this drama!"

He shot her a warning look, voice low and urgent."Drama? The longer we stick around, the more likely we are to get dragged into it. Let's just keep
our distance-save our money for your treatments instead of getting mixed up with people like her."


The woman sighed in resignation but craned her neck anyway, bargaining. "Fine, but at least stop somewhere I can still watch."


Christina's icy gaze lingered on the unconscious boy sprawled on the stretcher, her face unreadable. She pivoted back to Katie, her eyes now glinting with a lethal, wintry edge.


Without a word, Christina closed the distance between them, her steps brisk and unyielding.


Katie's bravado faltered as she stumbled backward, eyes darting with alarm. "What... What the hell are you doing?"


"Nothing much." Christina's voice was silk over steel. In one swift motion, she seized Katie's wrist and dragged her aside in one fierce tug. "Just making sure you get the fuck out of the way."


Losing her balance, Katie hit the floor with a bruising thud, yelping as she slammed down onto her rear end. "You psycho! How dare you lay a hand on me!" she bellowed, her face twisting with fury.


Christina barely spared Katie a glance, cold
WAAgIe
indifference written across her features. Then,she turned to the medical staff. "Please do everything you can: I'll make sure Dr. Emmett gets here."


Though the doctors and nurses doubted Christina could grab Calvin onto this case, something in her unwavering tone commanded their trust. Without another word, they rushed the stretcher into the waiting elevator.


"You despicable bitch! You hear me? You'll pay for this!" Katie wailed, her shrill voice echoing down the hall as she flung herself at Christina,wild-eyed and vengeful, hell-bent on dragging Christina down with her.yutt
###Chapter 77 Table Turned
As everyone assumed that the seemingly gentle Christina would be crushed by the fierce and wild Katie,what happened next shocked them.
Christina stood still, her face unreadable. When the crowd assumed she was frozen with terror,she effortlessly lifted her hand and grabbed Katie's wrists.
Katie struggled fiercely, but Christina's grip was unyielding. No matter how hard Katie tried,she couldn't break free.
The onlookers' perspective of Christina shifted.lt was only then that the onlookers realized this seemingly delicate woman was much stronger than she appeared.
Katie thrashed and fought, her frustration boiling over into visible rage. "Release me!" she hissed.
Katie swung her leg in a desperate kick, but Christina effortlessly dodged, releasing one of Katie's hands in the process.
In a flash, Christina slipped behind Katie. With a quick step forward, she jabbed her knee sharply into the back of Katie's leg.
Katie gasped as sharp pain shot through her leg,and she collapsed onto her knees.


A voice from the crowd broke the silence."Whoa!Did you see that?"


Applause burst out, followed by cheers and whispers all around.


"Wow! That was incredible! The gorgeous lady is so cool!"


"That wild woman looks like she's got money. Do you think the gorgeous lady will get in trouble for this?"


"That wild woman totally deserved that. Some people need to be put in their place."


"Man, I'm a guy, and even I wouldn't have the guts to stand up to someone like that wild woman.The gorgeous lady isfearless."


"What's the big deal? You're all hyping that great-looking chick up way too much. She just beat me to intervene,nothing special,"


"Really? Then what stopped you from stepping earlier? At least the gorgeous lady had the guts to act. Is it so hard to admit someone else is better
than you? People like you are all talk. Big words when it's over, but nowhere to be found when it counts."


By the time Katie snapped back to her senses,she was already down on her knees-her designer tights torn, her leg screaming with pain.Kneeling in front of a crowd was bad enough.And for her, who had been spoiled and revered her whole life, it was beyond degrading. She was used to watching others kneel, never imagining she'd be in that position herself. Now, trapped in this humiliating pose as a sea of onlookers clapped and jeered, rage surged through her.How dare that wretched Christina disgrace her like this in public?


Katie struggled to rise, but her hands were still pinned tightly behind her back by Christina. A firm pressure on her shoulders forced her to bend forward, making resistance impossible. She couldn't even lift her head, let alone fight back.


Katie was livid. That wicked Christina! It was no surprise-Christina was nothing more than a lowly servant, hardened by years of tough labor.Naturally, she possessed the raw strength to dominate so easily.


"Let me go!" Katie snarled through clenched DT    MT teeth, her voice low and furious. "If you don't let go right now, I swear you'll regret it!"
###Chapter 78 Catch The Bag Effortlessly
Everything happened in a flash, catching everyone off guard. Most people just froze,staring straight at the scene. Christina didn't even see it-her back was turned. Everyone thought the bag would slamn into her. Instinctively, they held their breath.


But then Christina raised her hand, calm as ever,and caught the flying bag like it was nothing.



The crowd was stunned.Eyes widened. For a split second, it felt like time had stopped.Unbelievable.What kind of reflex was that?


"No way! Did she really just catch that so easily?"


"That's insane! I blinked so many times-I still can't believe what I saw."


"She must've gotten lucky,right? Even if one saw it coming,reacting that fast is nearly impossible."


"Could she be trained or something? But she looks so delicate. It doesn't add up."


"Oh my God, that was epic! I'd marry someone that cool!"
Katie, who had thrown the bag, stood frozen,completely shaken. This couldn't be real. Did Christina have eyes in the back of her head?


Fear crawled through Katie's body. Her limbs locked up, trembling.


Christina's eyes turned cold. Without saying a word,she flung the bag back.


It hit Katie right in the stomach. "Ugh!" she gasped, doubling over from the pain. She clutched her belly, struggling to breathe as her knees buckled. Her face turned red as she sank to the floor.


Around them, the crowd erupted into cheers and clapping. It felt like they had just watched a villain go down. They were more thrilled than Christina herself.


Katie shook with rage, her body trembling like a volcano about to blow. These people were just as disgusting as Christina! All of them-pathetic nobodies with nothing better to do!


When Katie finally caught her breath and looked up, Christina was gone. Her eyes darted to the doorway, burning with fury as she clenched her teeth. She wouldn't let this go. She would make Christina pay!
Whispers from the onlookers reached Katie's ears -though she couldn't hear the exact words, she knew they weren't saying anything good. She glared at them and snapped, "What are you looking at? Want trouble?"


No one replied. They backed away quickly. No one wanted to mess with someone from a rich family. In fights like these, the poor always lost.They couldn't fight back, but they knew how to stay out of trouble.






Ding! The elevator doors slid open, and Christina stepped out.


She had barely taken a step when two tall, broad-shouldered men blocked her way. They wore plain clothes,but she could tell-they weren't ordinary men. They were fighters. Most likely Calvin's bodyguards.


Christina softened her expression, looking small and harmless-like someone easy to overlook."Hello, I'm here to see Dr. Emmett. Could you please let him know I'm here?" Her voice was polite and respectful.


But the men didn't blink. Their faces were like stone. "Please leave. Dr. Emmett isn't taking
visitors," one of them said coldly.


Their job was to protect him. No matter how harmless Christina looked, they weren't taking chances. She could be anyone-even a trained assassin in disguise.


Christina saw through them. No matter how innocent she acted, they weren't letting her in.She didn't waste time. She raised her voice toward the office door. "Dr. Emmett! Dr. Em-"


The bodyguards moved in, ready to drag her away. But she shouted even louder. "Calvin Emmett!"


Her voice had barely faded when a thunderous roar echoed back. "How dare you call Dr.Emmett by name?Nah
###Chapter 79 Calvin's Shift In Demeanor
A middle-aged man in his fifties stepped forward,his face sharp with authority as he scanned Christina from head to toe."How dare you,young lady, call Dr. Emmett by his full name?" he scolded.


But as the man looked closer and saw how young Christina was, his anger eased a little. She probably didn't know any better. Still, he didn't like her tone. Not one bit. This was Calvin they were talking about-one of the world's most respected surgeons. Even now, his hands worked with the steady precision of a master.When it came to craniotomies, no one could match him.He was a living legend. Admired. Respected.Idolized by doctors across the globe. For many in the medical world, just seeing Calvin once was a lifelong dream. To learn from him-even the smallest bit of wisdom-was an honor.



"You must be the director, Mr. Johan Duffy,"Christina said with a calm smile,meeting his gaze without flinching."Good day,Mr.Duffy.I'd like to meet Dr.Emmett."
By now, the two bodyguards had her firmly in their grip. But she remnained calm, still smiling.


Johan raised a brow, slightly surprised. She had guts. Maybe it was just youthful boldness.Something about her coolness impressed him.Still, he couldn't say he liked her approach.


His eyes swept over her again, stern as ever.Then, Christina bent her knees and began to sway gently, using the bodyguards like a pair of swing posts and smiling like she was enjoying herself.


Johan was so caught off guard that he nearly laughed out loud. She reminded him of his granddaughter-the same playful spirit, the same spark in her eyes. His impression of her softened,just a little. But he didn't drop his stern tone. "Dr.Emmett doesn't see visitors. You should leave at once."


Christina swung a little harder. "No. I must see him."


The bodyguards exchanged exasperated looks. If they had known she'd turn them into swing posts,they wouldn't have hold her in the first place.She looked like she was having a grand old time,though it was a serious test of their arm strength.
Johan sighed."Young lady,are you not listening?Dr. Emmett is very busy. You can't just demand to see him. He doesn't have time for random visitors." He waved a hand at the bodyguards."Take her back to the elevator."


This was already an unusually polite order coming from Johan. Normally, he'd have ordered the bodyguards to toss someone like her out without a second thought.


The bodyguards turned Christina around and began escorting her away.


"I need to see Dr. Emmett!" Christina shouted."Calvin! Calvin Emmett! Calv-"


A deep voice cut through the hallway like a thunderclap. "Wait!"


Everyone froze.It was Calvin.


Christina's eyes lit up, and a bright smile spread across her face. She had planned to act out and force her way through if Calvin didn't show up.But now that Calvin had appeared, things were much simpler.


"Dr. Emmett! I am here! Help me! Please save me!" Christina cried out, pretending to struggle in their arip.Calvin immediately recognized the voice-it was none other than the legendary healer, King! His heart leapt into his throat. "Let go! Let go of her right now!" he shouted, rushing forward so fast that he nearly lost his footing. He looked ready to shove the bodyguards out of the way himself.
Calvin was flustered. If they offended King,how could he ever hope to learn from her? If there was only one miracle worker left in the world-it was her.He couldn't afford to anger her.
Johan and the bodyguards stood frozen in shock,staring at the man they thought they knew. Was this really Calvin? The calm, noble surgeon who always carried himself like a king? Now, he looked like a desperate grandfather ready to throw punches for his beloved granddaughter.
###Chapter 80 Surgical Operation
Calvin's breath faltered, overwhelmed, nearly slipping out "King" before Christina's voice gently interrupted. "Good to see you, Dr. Emmett."


Only then did Calvin realize how close he'd come to slipping the name he was not supposed to say.He cleared his throat. "Christina, what brings you here?"


"I've come seeking your help to save someone.And there's another favor I must ask," Christina responded, her tone seemingly carrying urgency.


"Who needs help? Is it you-" Calvin paused,suddenly cautious. He swallowed his words. He knew better than to mention anything that might reveal Christina was actually King. She was always careful to stay out of sight, and if she had come in person, it meant the situation was dire.


"There's a young boy in this hospital in critical condition. Please, Dr. Emmett, follow me,"Christina implored,


Calvin didn't hesitate. "Of course. Lead the way."


"But, Dr. Emmett, what about the Lorbridge surgery?" Johan interrupted. "It's scheduled for today."

Calvin turned to him calmly. "That can wait."

Calvin knew what he was facing. Christina seeking him out meant time was running out.If he delayed, the young boy in question wouldn't survive. The operation at Lorbridge was important but not pressing enough to supersede this crisis.It could be rescheduled.Moreover,since Christina had entrusted him with this case herself,refusal was not an option.

Johan looked stunned but didn't argue. He just followed behind quietly, still trying to piece together what was happening. He scrutinized Christina, his mind racing. Who was this woman who could make Calvin change plans without a second thought? Calvin had always referred to Christina as just a former assistant. But this? This was different. No way an assistant made Calvin postpone surgery for a VIP patient. There was more to her.Way more.

Whatever the truth， Johan decided on one thing一he'd treat Christina with respect from now on.

The group soon entered the elevator. The elevator doors opened with a soft ding as they reached their floor. Calvin started to gesture for Christina to go first, but she beat him to it."Please, Dr. Emmett," she said gently, giving a polite nod.


Though uneasy receiving such courtesy, Calvin accepted, stepping out first. He had long hoped to be recognized as her protégé, but she always refused, insisting it would be inappropriate given his stature. Still, their conversations often turned into debates about medicine. She challenged his thinking and broadened his views. While he had ceased pursuing the formal apprenticeship,the desire remained quietly alive.


As they entered the emergency room, they were met with chaos.


"We're losing him!" a nurse cried.



"Flatline! He's in cardiac arrest!" another shouted,their voices laced with panic.




The moment Calvin and Johan arrived, the medical staff froze in astonishment. Christina had really brought Calvin here,


Without a moment's hesitation, Christina stepped forward to lend her expertise in the frantic efforts to revive the boy.
Everyone had already put aside Katie's claim that Christina was a vet. Even if Christina was a vet,the fact that she'd come alongside Calvin-and was trusted to assist-meant she was more than capable. Saving a life transcended professional titles and disciplines.


"Get the operating room ready," Calvin commanded with calm authority. "As soon as he's stable, transfer him at once."


"Right away," Johan answered promptly,immediately overseeing the preparations himself.


Through their combined skill and urgency, the boy's vital signs gradually steadied, allowing for his swift transport to surgery.


The next crucial procedure was a craniotomy. Yet,the boy's family had not yet arrived to provide the necessary consent. Ordinarily, the absence of signed permission would halt any operation to avoid legal complications. However, given the severity of the case, Calvin's direct involvement,and Christina's payment upfront, the team had no option but to proceed without delay.


As the boy was being wheeled into the operating room, his mother burst into the hospital,frantic and disheveled. She'd been so panicked on the
way that she'd slipped into a puddle, soaking her clothes and ruining her makeup. Her hair was wild and messy. But none of that mattered now. Her son had been in a car accident-he was in emergency surgery-and she didn't know if he was alive or not.


After asking around frantically, she finally learned that her son was in the operating room. A nurse explained his condition to her. "What did you say?A brain tumor?" she gasped, clutching the nurse's arm in disbelief, her voice trembling. Self-reproach washed over her like a tidal wave. How had she missed something so serious? How could she have been so blind?


"Yes, the procedure is intricate and high-risk.We urgently require your signature on the consent forms," the nurse said softly.


The mother's fingers clenched tightly around the nurse's arm upon hearing this. "What... What are the chances of survival? Is your finest surgeon the one performing it? Can you bring in the very best? No matter the expense, I will pay-money is no object!" she pleaded, desperation thick in her voice,


The nurse hesitated, choosing her words carefully. "The procedure is extremely complex.
Even our top expert hesitates to undertake it.."


"What? Then who's operating on my son?" the mother demanded, voice trembling with fear and confusion. Her breaths came in uneven gasps,mirroring the turmoil swirling in her mind.


"It's Dr. Emmett," the nurse replied. "A woman came and requested him personally... He agreed to take the case."


The mother blinked, stunned. "Dr. Emmett?" she repeated,almost in disbelef. Slowly,tears welled in her eyes, her expression shifting from panic to relief.


"Thank heavens it's Dr. Emmett... My son's lifeis in good hands," she whispered, her voice thick with gratitude. Then, she grasped the nurse's hand."Where is the consent form? Give it to me now-I'll sign immediately!"


A huge weight seemed to lift from her shoulders.Just knowing Calvin had taken the case gave her hope.She was eager to complete the paperwork quickly, fearing he might reconsider. Once the form was signed, she asked for the location of the operating theater,


But just as the nurse turned to leave, she suddenly called out, "Wait..."
###Chapter 81 Suspicions
The nurse regarded the mother with a confused frown. "Is there something else you need?"


"I was hoping to ask about the lady who brought Dr. Emmett in," the mother said, her tone soft but intent. "Could you possibly check the surveillance cameras? I'd like to find her and thank her properly."


"I heard she followed Dr. Emmett into the OR," the nurse replied. "If she's not around afterward, you can return later to review the footage."


"Alright. Thank you," the mother said with composed grace, a hint of urgency flickering behind her words.


The mother then turned and quickly made her way to the operating room. But once there,standing just outside the doors, unease settled heavily in her chest. Calvin was a renowned surgeon-among the best in the world. She trusted his brilliance implicitly, but fear gnawed at her all the same. Her son was everything to her.The thought of losing him was a terror she couldn't bear to entertain,
Her mind wandered to the mysterious young woman who had entered the operating room with Calvin. Who was she? His protégé? Unlikely.Calvin had stopped mentoring years ago. And if the nurse was right about the woman's age, the woman might be his student.However,Calvin had stepped back from academia long ago.Retirement had beckoned, and he had answered -partially.He'd intended to withdraw completely,to finally rest and enjoy what remained of his years. But the call of medicine, of patients with rare and formidable conditions, had never truly left him. He chose a quiet middle ground: semi-retirement, still saving lives, one surgery at a time.
The mother paced the corridor with anxious steps, each minute an eternity stretching into the unknown.
Meanwhile,inside the operating room. Calvin was deep into a delicate craniotomy, his hands steady as he worked on the boy's fragile skull.
hristina stood silently off to the side, her posture composed, her presence quiet yet unmistakably intentional. She neither assisted nor intervened,simply observed, her face an unreadable mask of calm focus.
Around Christina, the surgical team exchanged
discreet glances. Even Johan found his gaze repeatedly drifting to her. Who was she, and what was her connection to Calvin? And why had she been allowed inside the OR when she wasn't part of the medical team? She hadn't spoken or lifted a finger to help. Yet, she stood there as though she belonged.
With time on his hands and no instruments to monitor, Johan continued to observe Christina and Calvin. And then he saw it-small, fleeting,but impossible to ignore. Every so often,Calvin would glance at Christina. Not in irritation or distraction-but with a strange, quiet intention. As if he were looking to her for guidance.
he realization hit Johan like a jolt. He blinked,stunned, his thoughts spiraling. Who was this young woman, watching one of the world's foremost neurosurgeons as if she were the authority in the room? Could it be possible that she was more skilled than Calvin himself? And yet...Why had no one heard of her? If someone that gifted had entered the field-especially someone so young-the medical world would be buzzing with her name. But there was nothing. No whispers,no papers,no recognition
Johan's brow tightened as he studied the pair again. Calvin wasn't just glancing at Christina. He was deferential.
The more Johan tried to piece it all together, the more his thoughts unraveled. Nothing made sense. Whoever Christina truly was, one thing had become undeniable-she wasn't just another observer. There was a gravity about her, a presence that demanded caution.


Johan wasn't alone in sensing this. Around the operating room, the rest of the surgical team had picked up on it too-the subtle deference in Calvin's glances, the almost imperceptible shift in atmosphere whenever Christina so much as moved.


Speculation buzzed silently behind surgical masks. Yet, none of them entertained the idea that Christina could be a medical prodigy.It just didn't fit. If someone so young had risen to a level that rivaled Calvin, whose hands had performed the imnpossible more times than anyone could count, the entire medical community would be ablaze with her name. And yet, there had been nothing.


To them, only one figure in the world could stand shoulder to shoulder with Calvin's reputation: the elusive genius known only as King.
King wasn't just respected-King was mythologized. A legend cloaked in mystery,whispered about in awe-struck tones at conferences and operating theaters alike.
No one knew King's gender. No one had seen their face. Not even the most powerful medical directors or global heads of surgery had met this mysterious savant.
King's brilliance was the stuff of folklore. To receive direct guidance from King was the stuff of dreams. To merely see King would be the crowning moment of any surgeon's career. But such dreams always ended in quiet resignation.Most had long accepted that they would never meet King-never even know who King was.
Meanwhile, outside the operating room, the elegant mother continued her anxious pacing, her heels echoing softly in the sterile hallway.Every minute crawled by, weighted with dread and hope. Then, without warning, the doors flew open.She surged forward,heart pounding.
Calvin stepped out, blinking in surprise at the sight of her.
###Chapter 82 Do You Know Who She Is
"Why are you here?" Calvin blinked, momentarily thrown by the mother's sudden appearance. "I thought you were still overseas."


"I just got back," the mother replied, her anxiety spilling over as she hurried closer. "Dr. Emmett,tell me-how's my son? Is he..."


Before she could voice her fears, the doors swung open and her son was wheeled out, pale but breathing. The relaxed expressions on the medical staff's faces made her breathe a quiet sigh of relief.


Calvin's voice softened as he spoke. "The operation went smoothly. He'll need to be monitored, but he's out of danger."


A flood of emotion washed over the mother's face. "Thank you, Dr. Emmett," she murmured,her voice thick as tears threatened to spill.


But Calvin simply pointed at Christina, who stood quietly to the side. "You should really thank her.She's the reason we made it in time,"


The mother turned, finally taking in Christina.
Christina stood with the understated poise of someone far too striking to blend into any crowd -fine-boned, impossibly graceful, with an air that seemed to shimmer even in the harsh hospital lights. Her beauty rivaled any starlet, yet there was something more-an aura both serene and magnetic.


"So you must be the one who brought in Dr.Emmett?" the mother asked, stepping forward.Gratitude shone in her eyes as she gazed at Christina.


"Yes, I am." Christina met her eyes with a gentle,self-assured smile and reached out first for a handshake.



"Thank you so much. If you hadn't stepped in to save my child, I don't know what would have happened to him..." The mother's voice shook,and she clung to Christina's hand, as if anchoring herself to her son's savior.


"It's really nothing. Dr. Emmett is the one you should thank most. I might've tried, but without him, my good intentions alone couldn't have brought in the right help," Christina replied,her lips curving into a gentle, reassuring smile.


Calvin cast Christina a glance, the corner of his
mouth quirking with the trace of a smile. Her knack for faking it stayed flawless as always. If fate hadn't intervened, revealing Christina's hidden identity during the night she saved him,he never would have guessed that the legendary healer,King,was this quiet young woman.


"Both of you deserve my deepest gratitude," the mother murmured sincerely, her gaze sweeping over Christina and Calvin. "Once my son's condition stabilizes, I'll host a dinner tomorrow at Morfort Restaurant. Please-let me show my appreciation to you both."


Before Christina could protest, the mother continued with quiet determination, "I insist. It's the least I can do to thank the people who saved my child."


Recognizing her resolve, Christina relented and gave a small, warm nod. "Alright. We'll look forward to it."



"For now, you should go accompany your son,"Calvin remarked, his voice gentle but firm. "We have other matters to take care of."


The mother read the polite hint and offered a gracious smile, "Sure, I'll let you get back to work," She glided away, her composure
 
unshaken.


As her heels clicked down the hallway, Calvin exhaled.

Christina shot him a confused look. "Why the sigh? The surgery went smoothly, didn't it?What's with the gloomy expression?"


With a sly smile, Calvin asked, "Do you have any idea who she is?"


Christina just shrugged, the faintest smirk on her lips. "Not a clue."


He let out a low, knowing laugh. "Figures. Aside from medicine, nothing else ever seems to register with you."


The corners of his mouth lifted in an affectionate,slightly exasperated smile. Her world probably looked like an endless stream of case files and surgical notes, leaving no space for anyone or anything else.


Christina didn't bother pretending to care about that mother's background, but since Calvin had brought it up, she tossed out a casual question."So,who is she then? Some big potato?"


Leaning in,Calvin lowered his voice, his words tinged with significance. "She's the eldest
daughter of the Gomez family from Lorbridge."

He hesitated for a heartbeat and then added,"Actually, I'll be heading out soon to operate on another high-profile member of their family."


Christina gave a quiet, contemplative nod. lf Calvin's tone was any indication, the Gomez family was far from ordinary-more like the type whose every move sent ripples through the city. "I see. It's getting late-you should get some rest.I'll head home as well."


Calvin offered an easy smile. "Alright then.Just don't forget about dinner tomorrow."


"Don't worry. I won't," Christina replied, her tone warm but resolute.


After they went their separate ways, Christina made her way out of the hospital. She had meant to meet Davina for dinner, but with everything that had happened, she'd had no choice but to postpone.


As she stepped through the hospital's sliding doors and into the cool evening air, a figure moved toward her from the curb. She recognized the man instantly-it was one of Dylan's drivers, a familiar face from past encounters.
The driver offered a respectful nod. "Miss Jones,Mr. Scott is waiting for you."
Chapter 83 Unexpected Contact
Christina blinked, surprised. "Dylan is waiting for me?"


"Yes," the driver replied.



Her curiosity got the better of her. "How long has he been waiting?"


"Roughly four hours," the driver replied, his tone honest and composed.



"Four hours?" Christina's eyes widened. "We need to hurry!" Shocked by the revelation, she wasted no time and followed the driver with quickening steps.


Earlier, Dylan had messaged her, offering to pick her up. She'd declined, busy with other matters, assuming he'd simply move on. She never imagined he would wait-and for that long.


When they reached the sleek black Maybach,
the driver stepped forward and opened the rear door with practiced" precision. "Miss Jones,please."


"Thank you," she said, her voice soft but earnest, as she stepped inside.


Dylan sat waiting, dressed in a sharp black suit tailored to perfection. His long fingers were loosely laced over his knees, his posture relaxed yet commanding. There was a magnetism to him-an almost disarming calm that cloaked a presence impossible to ignore.


"Done with work?" Dylan's voice broke the silence as he turned toward Christina, his tone even, stripped of its usual sharpness. Tonight,his eyes held a calmer sheen-still unreadable,but no longer cold.


Christina gave a quiet nod. "Yes. You didn't have to wait. It's a hassle-| could've found my own way back."


"Chloe wouldn't hear of it," Dylan replied,his expression smooth as glass. "She insisted l
bring you home and said she wouldn't sleep otherwise."


"In that case... Thank you," Christina said softly.



"It's nothing," he replied, as if brushing off a speck of dust.


A faint smile tugged at Christina's lips, but the exchange withered there.



They weren't exactly friends-barely more than acquaintances. The silence that followed felt stiff, like a wall neither knew how to climb.


Christina shifted her gaze to the window,letting the passing lights of the city pull her attention away. To her relief, Dylan didn't question her about what had kept her at the hospital. She didn't have the energy to lie-or the desire to explain.


The car glided along the nighttime streets, its interior hushed like a sanctuary. The glow of passing neon signs painted fleeting patterns on the glass as Christina drifted into her thoughts.
Suddenly, Dylan's voice pierced the quietness."Has King reached out to you?"


Christina blinked, drawn back from her reverie."Hm?No..."



She turned to him, a flicker of confusion knitting her brow. But before she could finish her sentence-the driver yanked the steering wheel.The sudden jolt sent Dylan off balance-he instinctively reached out, one hand gripping the seat, the other sliding around Christina's waist just in timne to keep her from crashing forward.


In the scramble, his lips grazed her forehead.



The light, accidental contact stunned Christina.A cool sensation bloomed where his lips had brushed, freezing her in place as a wave of inexplicable energy surged through her. Her breath hitched. Her mind went blank. A shiver of awareness zipped down her spine, leaving her numb,dazed,breathless.


The car was eerily silent save for the hum of the tires and the thunder of two racing hearts.
Then, another lurch. This time, Christina fel completely into Dylan's arms. Her lips met the fabric of his shirt-soft cotton and the sharp,unmistakable scent of him. When she pulled back slightly, a vivid red imprint of her lipstick remained, stark against the pure white like a scarlet blossom in snow.


Leaning against him, Christina couldn't ignore the warmth of his body, the clean, intoxicating scent that wrapped around her, made richer with each inhale. She could feel his heart under her palm-strong, rhythmic, grounding. And it was speeding up.


As if pulled by an invisible force, Christina found herself drawing closer, her senses narrowing until all she could hear was the beat of his heart.


Dylan looked down at her, his gaze sharpening as he watched her inch nearer. His heart-steady and composed just moments ago-now raced uncontrollably. It didn't make sense. He had never lost his composure over a woman's touch. Now, his pulse was thundering in his
ears, and he couldn't look away. What was this feeling?
###Chapter 84 Jealousy
"Mr. Scott, Miss Jones, are you both okay?" The driver's sudden inquiry brought Christina and Dylan sharply back to the moment.



A flush of embarrassment colored Christina's cheeks as she quickly disentangled herself from Dylan's embrace, striving to appear composed."I'm alright."



"Apologies," the driver continued. "A car swerved into our lane earlier. I had to dodge it,



"No worries. As long as we're safe," Christina cut in gently, her voice steady and reassuring.



She turned her gaze toward Dylan, casually asking, "How about you? Are you doing alright?"



"Fine," he replied tersely, his face straight. His ears tingled with heat, and a lingering warmth colored his face. Determined to hide it, he adopted an intentionally distant demeanor.He hated to admit it, but he felt oddly hollow when she pulled away.
"It's a good thing the driver reacted so quickly.That was impressive," Christina said sincerely.



The driver's face reddened modestly. "You're too gracious, Miss Jones."



The driver opened his mouth to speak further but fell silent when Dylan's icy glance met his in the rearview mirror. The jolting maneuver earlier hadn't disturbed Dylan, but now an unmistakable irritation shadowed his expression.Could jealousy be simmering beneath his composed exterior because of Christina's praise?



Sensing the tension mounting, the driver wisely chose silence, focusing intently on the road ahead.



Christina suddenly noticed a smudge of lipstick staining Dylan's immaculate white shirt. "Oh no -your shirt! My lipstick got on it!"



Dylan looked down. Sure enough, a faint red stain had bloomed on his crisp white shirt. His jaw tightened slightly. The image of Christina falling into him replayed in his mind, the softness of her lips brushing against his chest,the warmth of her body, the scent of her perfume. The moment had been brief, but it
lingered like a whisper on his skin.



Christina pulled out a tissue from her bag,leaning in to grab his collar gently. "When we get back, give me the shirt-I'll clean it for you and make sure it's good as new," she said,frowning in concentration as she reached out to clean the lipstick mark.



Just then, Dylan's hand unexpectedly closed around her wrist.



Stunned,Christina lifted her eyes to meet his,confusion flickering within. His grip was gentle,far from restrictive, and the warmth of his touch,combined with the subtle roughness of his skin,unexpectedly brought a comforting sensation.



"I'll just dab it lightly so it won't spread across your shirt," she murmured.



"That's alright," Dylan responded in a flat,unemotional tone.



Christina blinked in surprise. "Huh? What did you say?"



"I said it's alright," he repeated calmly, his features unreadable.
After a brief pause, he added softly, "The mark doesn't look bad on my shirt."



Christina stared at him, momentarily speechless.Wait-what? She clearly remembered Chloe telling her how obsessed Dylan was with cleanliness.People with a cleanliness obsession usually couldn't bear even the slightest blemish on their clothes. So why was he so composed -almost indifferent-about the lipstick mark?



While she was still trying to wrap her head around his bizarrely calm reaction, Dylan spoke up. "There's no need for you to clean it.Someone at home handles that sort of thing."



"Alright," Christina replied quietly, her gaze drifting to his hand circling her wrist.



Following her eyes, Dylan noticed he had yet to release her. "Sorry," he muttered, withdrawing his hand swiftly, though a subtle reluctance lingered in his motion. His hand dropped to his lap, fingers curling slightly like he was trying to hold on to the trace of her warmth that still lingered in his palm.
###Chapter 85 A Personal Driver
Christina brushed it off with an easy smile."Honestly, there's nothing to be sorry about."



A lull settled over the car before Dylan spoke up out of the blue. "I'll give the driver an extra month's bonus."



That caught Christina off guard. "Wait, what brought that on?"



"You mentioned earlier that his quick thinking and skill behind the wheel impressed you,"Dylan explained.



Her brow furrowed as she tried to catch up."Right.That's true, I did."



"Well, he deserves a reward then," Dylan said,his tone completely staightforward.



A laugh slipped out of Christina. "I don't really understand your rules. If you say he deserves it,then who am I to argue?"



"Alright," Dylan replied without hesitation.
The driver, overcome with gratitude, blurted out, "Thank you so much, Miss Jones. Thank you,Mr.Scott."



The driver was genuinely surprised. Instead of getting in trouble, he'd wound up with an unexpected bonus. From the rearview mirror,he shot Christina a grateful look, silent thanks shining in his eyes. He was certain he owed everything to her kindness.



Dylan made a sudden decision. "He'll be your personal driver from now on."



"Are you serious?" Christina's jaw dropped.



Without missing a beat, Dylan replied, "I've noticed you're always hailing cabs. Having a personal driver would spare you the hassle.There's no need for you to worry about the car or the costs-I'll handle the driver's salary and everything else."



She shook her head. "I appreciate it, but it's really unnecessary. I can manage to buy a car on my own. Plus, your fleet is a bit too flashy for my taste-l'd rather not draw attention everywhere I go."
Her plan all along was to buy something simple,nothing more than what she needed to get around-certainly not a showy ride. Meanwhile,every car in Dylan's collection was the kind that turned heads, high-end models with jaw-dropping price tags, a few even custom-built for him alone.



"If that's the issue, I'll just purchase something more understated," Dylan suggested.



"Driving myself is what I'm comfortable with."Christina gave a gentle sigh. It didn't sit right with her to keep accepting favors. Staying in Dylan's villa was generous enough. Taking a car and a driver felt like too big a leap.



"Think of the driver as a thank-you for looking after Chloe." Dylan's tone softened just a touch.



Watching Christina waver, Dylan added, "Let's say you've had a glass of wine or you're just too exhausted to drive-just call him. No need to worry about pay or benefits. I'll take care of everything. And he's getting an extra six months' bonus for his trouble."



The driver, who'd been listening intently, nearly let his foot slip from the pedal at the mention
of such a hefty bonus. Even with his heart racing,he managed to bring the car to a smooth stop outside the villa. He kept quiet,not wanting to interrupt, but his eyes found Christina's in the mirror, full of silent pleading and hope. A yes from her would mean the world to him. He'd treat the job with even more loyalty if she accepted.



Feeling the weight of his anticipation, Christina finally relented. A nod sealed it. "Alright then.Thank you, Mr. Scott."



For the first time that day, something gentle had flickered in Dylan's expression, the hint of a smile breaking through his usual reserve. Any trace of weariness vanished from his face,replaced by a quiet contentment.



"Thank you so much, Miss Jones!" the driver blurted out, unable to contain his joy.



A gentle smile lingered on Christina's lips.Dylan's voice followed, calm and steady. "Get some rest tonight. Tomorrow, he'll be waiting for your instructions."



Christina answered with a simple, "Okay."



Once outside the car, she lingered by the curb.
her eyes following the car until it vanished from sight. Only then did she head back into the villa.




Dawn brought a new day. Christina padded out of her room, still in pajamas. Shuffling downstairs and stifling a yawn, she blinked away sleep, her eyes scanning the living room. What she saw made her come to a sudden halt,completely taken aback.
###Chapter 86 Dylan Picked Her A Car
Dylan's sudden arrival left Christina momentarily frozen in place. She glanced down and was instantly mortified-she hadn't changed out of her ridiculous SpongeBob pajamas. For a heartbeat, she was tempted to sink straight through the villa floor and vanish.


When Dylan looked up, his glacial eyes landed on her, taking in the spectacle dressed in her pajamas. That absurd cartoon smile stretched across her chest, all yellow innocence and lopsided teeth-a jarring contrast to the sleepy,flustered woman wearing it. It was utterly adorable. The thought flashed through his mind before he could stop it. His lips twitched at the edges, betraying the faintest flicker of amusement, but his face quickly settled back into its usual severe composure.


He still looked every inch the untouchable,commanding figure-shoulders squared, jaw
set, presence somehow dominating the room even while sitting.


For a moment, Christina considered retreating-maybe slipping back upstairs and pretending she'd never seen him. But fleeing would only make things worse. Bracing herself, she inhaled deeply and squared her shoulders, forcing a look of careless ease onto her face. She strolled over, doing her best to appear unfazed by the situation. "So, what brings you by?" Her tone was deliberately breezy,though a hint of anxiety trembled underneath.



Dylan stood up slowly, every movement controlled and deliberate. "I brought the car and driver for you," he replied, his voice low and even as he fixed her with that unreadable gaze.



"Huh?" Christina's brows knitted, her confusion plain. Sure, she'd agreed to let the driver pick her up yesterday-but Dylan showing up himself with the car? That, she hadn't expected.



He added, "This one won't draw any attention.
It's completely unremarkable."


Christina arched a brow, half skeptical. "Alright,let's see what you picked out," she replied,following him out.


The moment she caught sight of the car, she stopped dead,wide-eyed.


The vehicle in question looked like it belonged in a Saturday morning cartoon: small, bubbly,painted in a riot of cheerful colors, its headlights shaped like doe eyes and a logo grinning up at her like a mischievous mascot. It wouldn't draw attention? Maybe in terms of price tag, but the design was anything but subtle. It was the kind of car that begged for double takes and selfies.



A faint twitch flickered across Christina's lips while she tried to make sense of the scene.Under her breath, she grumbled, "You're assigning a driver to this thing? Isn't that overkill?"



Dylan, expression unreadable, glanced at her."Don't like it?" he asked, as if the answer wasn't
written all over her face.


Christina managed a strained smile, shifting awkwardly. "No, it's cute, really. I'm just worried your driver might be insulted, driving me around in such a tiny car."


The driver jumped in without missing a beat."Not at all, Miss Jones! I'mhonored to drive you!" His eager tone left no room for doubt.


Christina forced another smile, lips twitching with reluctant amusement. She'd braced herself for a generic sedan-something practical,maybe a little boring. Never in a million years had she expected Dylan to pick out a car that looked like it belonged in a children's cartoon.



"You don't like it?" Dylan watched her reaction,his usually stoic face shadowed by a faint crease of worry. Chloe had insisted this was the perfect choice-affordable, discreet, and supposedly irresistible to women. Given Christina's fondness for playful pajamas, he'd felt oddly sure she'd fall in love with the car's
cutesy charm. But as he searched her face now,his confidence faltered. Beneath that icy exterior, uncertainty flickered. For a man used to keeping the world at arm's length, waiting for her approval felt almost unbearable.



A tense beat passed before Christina finally spoke. "It's...It's kind of cute. I like it," she said,the words soft but genuine. She hadn't expected this-a man as aloof as Dylan, going out of his way to choose something so cute for her. Everything about him, from his home's severe minimalist lines to his crisp, unflappable demeanor,exuded discipline. Yet, here he was,gifting her this car.



Dylan kept his features perfectly composed,but a subtle wave of relief washed through him."The car's yours now," he stated, his voice cool and even.



Christina met his gaze with uInwavering resolve."Then I'll pay for it. I'll send you the money,or you can just deduct it from my salary."
Dylan wasted no time. His lips barely moved as he answered, "I'll deduct it from your paycheck."


"Works for me," Christina replied, not missing a beat.


He adjusted his cuffs, mind already drifting back toward the office. "I have to get to the office.I'll head out."


Christina fell in step beside him. "Sure. I'll walk you out."


Then, without thinking, she asked, "Did you have breakfast yet?"


"Not yet," Dylan answered, his voice clipped and face still unreadable. But beneath that frosty exterior, a spark of longing flickered-so faint that it was almost invisible. At his side, his thumb traced a slow, unconscious circle against his forefinger, the only hint of his quiet anticipation.
###Chapter 87 A Shared Breakfast
Christina flashed an easy smile and suggested casually, "I haven't had anything to eat, either.How about we grab some breakfast together before heading to the office?"



Dylan came to an abrupt halt. "Alright."



The smile on Christina's face faltered for a second. Before she even realized what was happening, Dylan was already turning around and heading into the house.What in the world?She had only meant it as a friendly gesture-was he really going to take her up on it?



Still a little stunned, Christina hurried after him.



Meanwhile,Dylan walked ahead with a subtle smile playing on his lips, hidden from her view.




···



In the dining room, Christina found herself staring awkwardly at the bowl of oatmeal set in front of Dylan.
"Sorry about this. I told the kitchen last night that I wanted oatmeal for breakfast today.."She paused and then added, "If oatmeal isn't your thing, I can ask them to make something else Would you rather have some toast and milk?"



"Oatmeal is fine with me," Dylan replied, giving his head a shake.



"There are some vegetables and fried eggs here as well. Would you like any meat? I can get a plate for you," Christina suggested. A tiny worry nagged at her, thinking Dylan, as the head of the renowned Scott family, might not be used to such a simple meal.



Dylan responded, "No need. I prefer a light breakfast as it's good for health."



"I also think a light meal in the morning is best.Let me serve you some eggs and vegetables,"Christina said as she placed a bit of each on his plate.



Dylan picked up his bowl and started to eat.He couldn't tell if it was because he was truly hungry,but the oatmeal and side dishes seemed to taste better than anything he had eaten
before



While Christina ate, she sneaked glances at Dylan, curious about his reaction.Watching him enjoy the food, she was a little taken aback.All along, she had assumed he'd just been polite and wouldn't actually enjoy the meal. Clearly,she had been wrong



"Chloe's getting discharged today, and I may not be able to go get her. Would you mind taking care of that for me?" Dylan asked without warning



Christina gave a nod. "That falls under my job anyway. Don't worry, I'll make sure she's well taken care of."



"Alright." A slight crease formed between Dylan's brows, as though something was bothering him.



Christina noticed his sudden change and said,"What's wrong? You look like something's on your mind."



"It's nothing serious," Dylan answered after a glance at her. "I still haven't managed to secure the Woodfort."
"You'll find it," Christina said with firm conviction, her tone carrying a hint of encouragement In truth, she was already thinking about trying another prescription for Chloe If there was stillno progress on securing the Woodfort within three days, she would have to switch to a new prescription. She was worried about Chloe's condition worsening if the treatment delayed



"Hope so," Dylan replied softly That meal left him in a better mood than he expected-he felt light on his feet, re-energized, and prepared for whatever came next



After seeing Dylan off, Christina returned home,slipped into something comfortable, and headed out by herself.



Soon enough, Christina pulled into the parking lot. She had just stepped out of her car and hadn't even closed the door when an annoying voice rang out nearby.



"Christina! Your car is just too cute-is it new?"Yolanda's overly dramatic tone made her false excitement clear.



Christina saw no reason to answer. She pressed
her lips together and walked on with a frosty expression.



"Don't you walk away!" Katie's angry voice snapped as she blocked Christina's path."Yolanda was talking to you. Didn't you hear?Are you deaf, or were you never taught any manners, rendering you this rude?"



Christina's eyes turned hard as she stared back."Even if I were rude, I'd still be better than you."



Before Katie had the chance to fire back,Christina stepped around her and kept going.

Fuming, Katie stuck out her leg in frustration.A flash of spite shone in her eyes as she purposely tried to trip Christina, hoping to send her sprawling.
###Chapter 88 Dawson Group's Shares Will Be Given To...
Christina feigned a stumble the moment Katie tried to trip her, her body pitching forward as she acted like she was wavering before she steadied herself, deliberately stomping on Katie's leg several times in the process.



"Agh, that really hurts!" Katie gasped sharply,her face contorting as she swiftly withdrew her foot, the pain unmistakable.



"Christina, that's too much!" Yolanda rushed over,helping steady Katie with an expression of exaggerated concern. "Katie only said a few harsh words-did you really have to hurt her purposely?"



Christina turned slowly, her eyes like frost."Hurt her purposely? Are you serious? Should we pull up the hospital's security footage and see who started what? I nearly fell because of her, and I didn't hurt her purposely."



Yolanda faltered. "But... I saw you just now-you stepped on her."
"Exactly! This spiteful woman hurt me deliberately!" Katie's voice cracked with anger.



Christina's expression didn't change. "I didn't.But if you're so confident, I can ask the hospital director to pull the surveillance footage. Better yet,we can upload it and let the public decide."Her eyes swept over the two women, cold and fearless.



Katie's indignation surged, certain that Christina lacked access to the surveillance footage. She opened her mouth to argue, but Yolanda grasped her arm firmly.



"Let it go," Yolanda whispered under her breath,her voice soft but pointed. "Your brother and grandmother are both hospitalized. And don't forget-Christina is still y/our brother's ex-wife.There's no need to stir up trouble." She deliberately emphasized the word ex-wife,her tone sweet but laced with venom.



Katie snorted, regaining composure swiftly,and then leveled a sharp glare at Christina. "Don't mistake me for someone who's intimidated by you. Once my brother is discharged,you'll pay for this."
Christina didn't respond. She simply turned around and walked away, heading straight to Bethel's ward.



As soon as Christina entered, Bethel's face lit up."Christina,seeing you makes my day!"



"How are you doing?" Christina responded gently, seating herself beside the bed and enveloping Bethel's hand in hers. "Has your condition improved?"



"Much better now. Had it not been for your careful care,I might have passed away long ago,"Bethel said with a soft chuckle.



Christinafrowned slightly, replying, "Bethel,don't speak like that. You still have many years ahead-full of life and happiness."



Bethel laughed softly, her expression peaceful."At my age, I've already lived more than enough.Even if I left now, I'd have no regrets. But if l could live long enough to see your child come into this world, that would be a blessing."



"Bethel..." Christina lowered her eyes, her voice faltering."You know that Brendon and I... We're no longer..."
Bethel reached out and gently stroked Christina's head with her thin, wrinkled hand."I know. Brendon didn't cherish you the way you deserved. You're a remarkable woman, Christina.Brendon will regret the way he treated you one day. But when I said I wanted to see your child,I never meant it had to be Brendon's. Since being with him didn't bring you joy, then go on separate ways. I just want you to be happy."



To Bethel, Christina had long since become more than just her grandson's former wife. She was family.



"Bethel..." Christina whispered, her throat tightening. Emotion swelled in her chest.



"Don't worry, sweetheart," Bethel said gently,giving her hand a firm squeeze. "Even though Brendon turns his back on you, I never will."



Bethel paused and then added quietly, "I've already made my will. If something happens to me,all my shares of the company wll go to you."



Christina froze, shocked. "What? Bethel, what are you saying?"



"I mean it." Her tone was soft but resolute.
"This is my decision. Please don't try to talk me out of it." Her gaze turned serious. "The Dawson Group carries generations of effort, love, and sacrifice. I cannot bear to see that legacy crumble under the hands of those incompetent ones of this family. My husband trusted me with most of the shares, and I intend to honor that trust by choosing someone worthy."



Bethel exhaled. "You must realize by now that no one in the Dawson family can manage the Dawson Group like you can. You're the only one I believe in. You're smart, calm, and kindhearted -everything the company's future head needs.I don't know how much time I have ahead of me,Christina.Life is full of uncertainties-you never know whether tomorrow or an accident will come first."



As her words settled between them, Bethel's grip on Christina's hand tightened. "Christina,promise me you'll run the Dawson Group after my decease,will you?"
###Chapter 89 The Vile Thing
Christina studied Bethel quietly for a moment,her gaze gentle but unreadable.



Noting Christina's silence, Bethel said, "It's alright. If you'd rather not take on the helm of the Dawson Group, I won't push it. I understand.I only decided to give those shares to you to give you a sense of security-something to fall back on in the future."



Bethel offered a faint smile, the corners of her lips tugging up with resignation. "Even if I handed the shares off to that bunch of incompetent ones of the Dawson family, the Dawson Group would crumble anyway. Might as well give the shares to you."



Christina's smile was soft but steady. "Let's not talk about this now, Bethel. You're going to be fine. I'm sure of it."



Christina couldn't bear the thought of losing Bethel just yet. Bethel had always treated her like family. The warmth, the fierce protection,the love-it had meant the world to her.
"Alright. We'll save it for another time," Bethel said with a light chuckle. She had already put her affairs in order. The will was written.Now,she simply lived each day with quiet acceptance,ready for whatever came next.



"When I'm discharged," Bethel added, voice calm, "I'll transfer my family's estate to your name."



Before Christina could get a word in, the door to the hospital room flew open, crashing against the wall with a bang. A furious voice echoed through the room: "Absolutely not! That estate is not going to her!"



Christina didn't need to turn around. That grating, self-righteous tone was unmistakable -Brendon,her ex-husband.



"This is my decision," Bethel said icily, her voice cutting through the tension like glass. "And no one gets to overrule it."



Brendon stepped forward, ready to argue, but before he could get a word out, Yolanda clutched his wrist, reining him in. With a syrupy sweetness,she said to Bethel, "Mrs. Dawson,are you feeling any better? I brought some health
supplements for you-all the way from overseas."



She stepped forward with an elegant box and carefully placed it on the bedside table, her expression a mask of gentle concern.



Bethel's face hardened instantly. Her years of authority resurfaced in an instant, transforming her into the formidable matriarch she had always been. Her glare swept over Yolanda and the others like a blade. "Who gave you the gall to bring this vile thing into my hospital room?"



Yolanda flinched, her eyes welling up with tears at the public humiliation. She blinked rapidly,voice trembling as she said, "Mrs. Dawson, I know you've never liked me, but must you be so harsh? If my presence offends you this much,I'll go."



She deliberately brushed past Brendon as she made a move to leave. Predictably, he caught her by the arm.



"Yolanda, don't go." Even with the pain radiating from his still-bandaged head, his focus was solely on her.



"Let me go, Brendon," Yolanda whispered, her
voice trembling, her eyes shimmering with tears,her acting skills shining through.



"No." Seeing her look so fragile-so unjustly treated-sent a pang through Brendon's chest.With aching tenderness, he reached out to wipe away her tears.



"Brendon..." Yolanda's voice trembled as she looked up at him, eyes glistening with gratitude and false vulnerability.



But the scene was shattered by Bethel's roar."Enough! Get out of my sight.Now!"



Yolanda froze, her hands curling into tight fists at her sides. How dare this old hag humiliate her like this?



Brendon's frustration erupted. He turned toward Bethel, face flushed, his voice rising. "Why are you always so unfair to Yolanda?" Then, with a sharp turn, his glare fell on Christina. "Is it because she's been poisoning your mind?Whispering lies to turn you against Yolanda?"



Bethel's fury boiled over. With a resounding slam,her palm struck the bedside table. "Watch your mouth, Brendon!" she snapped. "Not everyone's as twisted as you. Christina has never said a
word against you guys. Never!"



"Oh really? Then explain your unwarranted hatred toward Yolanda!" he barked. "Why did you decide to give Christina the family estate when she's done nothing to deserve it?" 1



To Brendon, it had always been painfully clear -Bethel favored Christina. That favoritism had festered in him like a wound, one that never healed.



Katie stormed forward, her eyes locked on Christina with pure venom. "You manipulative slut!" she screamed. "What the hell did you do to my grandma? Slip her something? Cast a damn spell?"



"Who are you calling a slut?" Bethel's gaze snapped to Katie-cold,razor-sharp,lethal.Her voice was low now, controlled and cutting. The calm before the strike.



Katie faltered. That unblinking stare-it chilled her to the bone. And without thinking, she took two steps back, her bravado draining away like blood from her face.
###Chapter 90 Ungrateful Brats





With a gentle squeeze, Yolanda took Katie's hand and spoke softly, her words carefully chosen to make her appear understandable while subtly pissed Katie off. "Katie, please don't make a scene. Let's listen to your grandmother, okay? Christina's done so much for your grandmother. After all that care and patience she's shown, it's only fair for your grandmother to repay her somehow."


Katie's fear faded in an instant, swept away by a surge of anger. Witnessing Bethel's affection for Christina felt like a slap. How could an outsider earn more love from her grandmother than her,the granddaughter by blood? The sting of jealousy replaced every ounce of hesitation.


"| won't stand for this!" Katie shouted, yanking her hand free from Yolanda's grasp. "Why should I just accept this?" With trembling hands, she jabbed a finger at Christina. "She's
not even family! What gives her the right to inherit the Dawson estate?"


A sharp crack sounded as Bethel's palm slammed down on the table, her voice ringing out with authority. "Because the property is in my name. That means I get to decide who receives it!"


Stepping in before the moment escalated,Christina gently reached for Bethel's hand."Bethel, please-don't hurt your hand like that.It isn't worth it."


Instantly, Bethel's stormy expression softened,a warm smile breaking through as she turned to Christina. "Don't worry about me, sweetheart.I'm not hurt at all. You're the only one who truly cares how I feel," she said, casting a sharp glance at her grandchildren. "Unlike certain people in this family who've forgotten the meaning of gratitude."


From his place at the side, Brendon felt his irritation mounting. To him, it seemed like
Christina was more of a grandchild to Bethel than he or Katie ever was. He couldn't stay quiet anymore. "Grandma, even if the deed is in your name, the house is part of the Dawson family legacy. Let's face it-most of the family members will never accept what you're trying to do. Plus, you don't have much time left. Just rest in the hospital until death claims you. Don't wield your position as the matriarch just to cause chaos inside the family."


Brendon's bluntness hit Bethel like a slap,leaving her speechless. Disbelief filled her gaze,and tears threatened as anger mingled with heartbreak, an ache settling in her chest.


"He's got a point, Grandma. You have no business giving away what belongs to the Dawson family." Katie seized the chance to pile on.


Every word from Katie was cold and calculated,her eyes void of concern for Bethel's feelings.All she cared about was keeping the estate out of Christina's hands. If her grandfather hadn't
made the mistake of placing nearly all the company shares, the Dawson estate, and a handful of other properties in Bethel's hands,neither she nor Brendon would be forced to bow to Bethel. So what if Bethel was their grandmother? The Dawson family's assets would never go to an outsider. Now, in her old age, Bethel astonished them by abruptly deciding to transfer the Dawson estate to Christina. What an old fool.


Bethel's eyes glistened red as she looked long and hard at her grandchildren, a bitter smile touching her lips. In the past, she had adored Katie and Brendon, shielding them from every hardship as they grew. She had treated them like priceless treasures, making sure they lacked for nothing. Yet, all that love seemed to have been wasted on hearts grown cold.With every passing year, their rebellion had only deepened. The more she tried to rein them in,the more defiant they became.


Katie had always tested Bethel's patience the
most. Time and again, Bethel had been forced to clean up the messes. Their relationship never recovered from the day Katie had bullied a classmate so badly that the poor soul's arm was broken.


Bethel herself had insisted on taking Katie to the police, prioritizing what was right over family bond, even if it meant ruining their relationship.After her release, Katie had barely exchanged a word with Bethel. Whenever their paths crossed, Katie often turned away, choosing to avoid Bethel entirely.


Accusations had followed-whispers that Bethel lacked warmth, that she was cold to her own blood. Was that the truth? All she ever wanted was for her grandchildren to stay on the right track.


A dry, humorless chuckle escaped Bethel. Both Katie's and Brendon's words stung deeply.Decades of her life had gone into the Dawson family, her energy spent keeping their fortunes and reputation afloat. Even as the years
weighed her down, she had carried every responsibility, worried her pampered descendants would falter without her steady hand. All those sacrifices-the late nights, the constant stress, the toll on her condition-were now dismissed with their cruel words.Everything she had done was for them to lead a privileged life, yet here she was, receiving anything but due respect and gratitude.Sadness and disappointment settled over her like a heavy shroud, making it hard to breathe.


Tightness gripped Bethel's chest, the ache radiating down her arms and into her fingers,each breath a struggle against a pain that threatened to swallow her whole.


A sudden wave of agony hit. Bethel's hand flew to her chest, her features twisting in pain.Her vision blurred, and within seconds, she crumpled to the floor, helpless.
###Chapter 91 Leave Dorfield
"Bethel!" Christina reacted right away, reaching out to keep Bethel from falling. She checked Bethel's condition quickly and pressed the call button for help without any hesitation.



Everything happened in the blink of an eye,leaving the others in the room frozen in shock,unable to react. Before anyone could collect themselves, Christina had already eased the unconscious Bethel down onto the bed.



Katie saw Christina examining Bethel's eyelids and rushed over, shoving Christina out of the way in a fit of anger. "Move! What do you think you're doing? Stop acting like you know everything! You're not even a real doctor-you're just a vet at best!"


The push made Christina stumble for a moment,but she quickly regained her balance and retorted coldly, "A veterinarian is still more
useful than you."


"More useful than me? How so? If it weren't for you,you jinx, would my grandma have fainted like this?" Katie shouted, her anger flaring.



Christina often wondered about the way Katie's mind worked. How could she so confidently shift blame onto others and act as if she were innocent?



"Didn't you all push Bethel to this point?"Christina responded, her voice cold.



Suddenly, the hospital room door swung open and a group of doctors and nurses rushed in,moving Bethel onto a stretcher and wheeling her out to the emergency room.


Everyone gathered outside the emergency room, nervously waiting for news about Bethel.


"Brendon, I'm so sorry. This is all on me. If l hadn't visited your grandma, she wouldn't have fainted like that..." Yolanda leaned on Brendon,her eyes rimmed with red as she gazed up at
him,seemingly apologetic.


"Don't blame yourself. This isn't your fault,"Brendon said, his tone soft.


"Naturally, Yolanda is not to blame," Katie sneered,her eyes filled with scorn as she shot a glare in Christina's direction. "It's that walking disaster's fault. She's the reason my grandma ended up like this."



Keeping her composure, Christina replied,"From now on, I want you all to stay away from Bethel. I'll look after her."



"You only/ want to stay close to my grandma so you can trick her into handing over the Dawson family estate! You're just like those conniving caretakers who plot to snatch their employers'assets!" Katie snapped, her voice full of spite.


A cold laugh escaped from Christina. "Think before you speak. Bethel might have fainted again if she had caught your absurd words.Don't piss her off again."
"When have we ever done anything to piss her off? You're the problem here! If you had just left Dorfield for good, none of this would have happened!" Katie yelled, her anger boiling over.


The absurdity of it all made Christina laugh again. She could never understand how Katie managed to spin the truth and always shift the blame onto others.


"Christina, I know you care about Mrs.Dawson's well-being," Yolanda interjected gently, her words calculated to smear Christina's reputation. "But you're not related by blood. Isn't it a bit much to forbid her grandchildren from visiting her?"


"Look at her-just another greedy outsider trying to grab the Dawson family's property!"Katie exclaimed with a curl of her lip. "Leaving her alone with my grandma is just giving her more time to fill my grandma's head with poison."


Christina shot Katie a look of pure contempt,as
if she were staring at an idiot. "You'll only continue to piss Bethel off with these absurd words. Just remember this-if something happens to her, it won't do you any good, but it might just work out in my favor."


Katie went stiff, her face twisted in bewilderment. "W-What's that supposed to mean?"


Brendon's brows drew together as he stared at Christina."What exactly are you up to?" Just being in the same room as her seemed to set him on edge.


"Christina, you wouldn't really hurt Mrs. Dawson just to get your hands on the Dawson estate,would you?" Yolanda asked in a shaky voice,clutching Brendon's arm and shrinking behind him as if she was frightened.


"The estate hasn't even changed hands yet. I'm not nearly as reckless as you are," Christina answered, a small smirk tugging at her lips as she looked at them with open disdain.
"So, does that mean if it does get transferred,you'd hurt her?" Yolanda pushed further, dead set on tarnishing Christina's image.


"I never said any such thing, nor do I have those kinds of intentions. Stop thinking that everyone is as calculating as you are," Christina replied in an even voice.


A wave of color drained from Yolanda's face,and tears started to fall down her cheeks. "I...I didn't mean for it to sound that way..."


"Christina! Haven't you stirred up enough chaos?" Brendon shouted, his glare sharp with frustration.


"Chaos? I haven't done anything of the sort. As long as I'm here, I'll make sure Bethel is safe,"Christina said, her tone unyielding.


"You? That's a laugh." Brendon scoffed."And what exactly can you do to mnake that promise?Where does all this confidence come from?"


"Believe what you want, but I am more than
capable of ensuring her well-being," Christina responded, steady and sure.


Brendon's gaze turned sharp, and there was no mistaking the challenge in his voice. "Alright then. If you can get Dr. Emmett to come today,we'll agree not to visit my grandma again until she's recovered. But if you can't, you'll have to stop setting your sights on the Dawson family estate or eyeing any of the Dawson family's assets!"


Before Christina could get a word in, Katie jumped in with excitement. "Hold on! There's more..." She aimed a smug smile at Christina. "If Dr. Emmett doesn't show up today, then you're leaving Dorfield for good. Don't even think about coming back."
###Chapter 92 Why Set Yourself Up For Embarrassment
Without missing a beat, Christina said, "Deal!Just remember to transfer five million to me once | fetch Dr. Emmett here as per our previous bet. Don't even think about weaseling out. And by then, don't forget the public apology you owe me. Here's a little reminder-once you lose the bet, forgget about securing the chance of receiving treatment from King." She had every intention of making Katie and the others fulfill their end of the bet today.



Katie's lips curled in a smug smile. "Works for me-as long as you can get Dr. Emmett here before the day's over."


Katie doubted Christina could pull it off,especially not on such short notice. She was convinced Christina was a total idiot for taking on the bet even under the condition of a limited
time. Booking a session with Calvin was already next to impossible. Even the city's elite had to wait for months, and Christina, barely valued by the Jones family, didn't stand a chance.



"But if you fail to bring Dr. Emmett,you know the deal. Hand over the chance of being treated by King," Brendon chimed in.


With unwavering calm, Christina just smiled."Sure."



Hearing her agreement, Brendon let out a silent breath of relief. For a while, he'd been worried that Christina might've already given King's treatment opportunity to someone else. But now, it seemed she was just holding on to the treatment opportunity, trying to use it as leverage to win him back. Sadly for her, her plan was doomed to fail in the first place since he'd made up his mind-his love story was with Yolanda.


Yolanda glanced at Brendon, her tone gentle as she made another attempt to solidify her kind
image in his heart. "Brendon, maybe we should just drop this bet and not make things difficult for Christina? After all, Christina is your ex-wife.I-I don't really mind if I can't receive treatment from King."


Brendon's gaze lingered on her pale cheeks and trembling lips, a pang of sorrow rising as he saw how willing she was to sacrifice for others. With emotion thick in his voice, he insisted, "I won't drop this bet. Yolanda, I will do everything I can just to cure your illness. Losing you isn't something I could ever accept."


"But..." Yolanda tried to object, measured uncertainty flickering in her eyes, but Katie cut her off before she could finish. "Yolanda, don't bother worrying about that snake Christina! You need to put yourself first. We're talking about the chance of receiving King's treatment-and the prospect of your illness gone forever!"


Tears welled in Yolanda's eyes, her words barely steady. "I just don't want to trouble you all.I don't want you to go through so much for me."
Brendon answered softly, conviction ringing in every word, "You're about to marry me.Whatever struggles you face, we'll face them together."


Across the room, Christina watched their exchange, a faint smile playing on her lips as though she were enjoying an overdramatic scene.



Her amusement didn't go unnoticed. Katie suddenly rounded on her, irritation spilling over."Why are you still standing there? Go fetch Dr.Emmett already! Don't think you can stall your way out of this. If you can't bring him today, you will lose the bet!"


Raising her eyebrows, Christina let out a light laugh. "Even I'm not in any hurry. Why are you?"


Katie scoffed, flicking her hair over her shoulder. "Why should I care? I'm not the one about to eat crow," she retorted, rolling her eyes before turning away, clearly done with the conversation.
Unfazed, Christina slowly pulled out her phone and punched in a number with practiced ease.


Almost instantly, the line connected, and Calvin's upbeat voice greeted her. "Funny, I was just thinking of calling you about a complicated case, and now you beat me to it."


Christina's lips curled into a small smile."|actually need a favor from you."


"Just say the word. You know I'll do whatever l can," he replied.


"I'd appreciate it if you could swing by the hospital. I'm here right now."


"Wait, you're already at the hospital? Is everything alright? | will come over immediately."


"Well, there's a patient I want you to examine."



"I'm actually at the hospital. Where are you exactly? I'll head over now."



She passed along her location and ended the
call, tucking her phone away with a look of calm satisfaction. Because she hadn't used speakerphone, everyone else remained clueless -no hint about who was on the other end of the line or what was said.



Katie scoffed, her tone dripping with sarcasm."Honestly, you're such a nice actress. Do you expect us to believe Dr. Emmett drops everything for you, as if he's just waiting by the phone to answer your call? Get real. He's far too busy for games like that."


Brendon shared her skepticism. Calvin's reputation as a top surgeon meant he was practically untouchable. Even if he made the trip to Lorbridge and pulled every string he could,getting even five minutes with Calvin would be nearly impossible, let alone under these circumstances.


Yolanda tugged at Katie's sleeve, her tone soft,her words carefully chosen to make her appear considerate while subtly echoing Katie's accusation. "Katie, please don't embarrass
Christina like that. It's really not polite to put someone on the spot."
Katie shot back without missing a beat, her eyes cold as she glared at Christina. "What's wrong with that? Since she's bold enough to make wild claims, exposing her feels like the right thing to do. She asked for it."



Letting out an exaggerated sigh, Yolanda turned her attention to Christina, her voice laced with false concern. "Christina, there's no need to put on an act like this. Someone like Dr. Emmett doesn't come when summoned by just one call.Why set yourself up for embarrassment?"


Before anyone else could speak, a commanding voice rang out, loud and authoritative,cutting through the tension. "Who accused Christina of putting on an act?"
###Chapter 93 Nosy Old Geezer
Katie,Brendon,and Yolanda jumped,startled by the sudden voice behind them.



Katie spun around, fuming. She didn't even check who it was before snapping,"You nosy old geezer! Can't you just mind your own damned business?"



She wasn't done yet and was about to hurl more insults when Brendon's cold voice cut in. "Shut up."



Katie clamped her mouth shut, shooting a glare at the energetic old man. Something about him felt familiar, like she'd seen him before. But her thoughts were cut short when Brendon spoke up respectfully. "Dr. Emmett, my sister meant no harm. I apologize on her behalf. Please forgive her."



As he spoke, he threw Katie a warning glance.



Katie froze and then stammered, "I-I'm sorry,Dr. Emmett. I didn't mean what I said. Please don't take it to heart."
Dr. Emmett. I didn't mean what I said. Please don't take it to heart."



Calvin snorted, his voice laced with sarcasm."An apology? An old geezer like me is not worthy of such grand gestures."



"We're truly sorry, Dr. Emmett," Brendon said,his brows drawn with worry. His tone was sincere,his posture humble. He clearly didn't want to offend Calvin. After all, even the biggest families in Lorbridge wouldn't dare step on Calvin's toes-let alone he.



"| really just spoke without thinking. Please forgive me, Dr. Emmett. I'm so sorry," Katie added quickly, her voice tight with emotion.



Yolanda stepped forward, her voice calm and sweet. "Dr. Emmett, you're a man of great standing. Surely you wouldn't hold a grudge against someone so young and impulsive?"



Calvin sneered and gave her a sideways glance."Spare me the sweet talk. I'm petty-l'd hold a grudge against even a newborn."1



Yolanda was left speechless. The awkwardness was palpable. This wasn't the Calvin she'd heard about. His reputation didn't match the man
standing before them.



Off to the side, Christina's lips curled into a faint smile as she discreetly gave Calvin a thumbs-up.



Calvin noticed and lifted his chin slightly, a flash of pride in his eyes. Then, he leaned into his arrogance as he shifted his gaze back to Katie and the others, his eyes tinged with disdain.



Katie fumed inside. She wanted to lash out but knew better. She couldn't afford to offend Calvin. If Calvin struck back, the Dawson family wouldn't stand a chance. She swallowed her pride and forced an apologetic look. "Dr.Emmett, I truly understand my mistake. Please forgive me this once."



At that moment, Brendon spoke up. "Dr.Emmett, were you invited here by Christina?"



He was trying to steer the conversation and fish for answers. If Christina had indeed invited Calvin here, maybe there was still hope to salvage the situation. Perhaps he could even seize the opportunity to build a connection.



"That's right," Calvin replied coolly, his sharp eyes scanning Brendon. The tone Brendon
mentioned Christina-was there something between them?





Katie,Brendon,and Yolanda stiffened in shock at Calvin's words. Christina had actually invited Calvin!



Brendon was the first to recover. He let out a quiet breath, slightly relieved. Maybe this wasn't such a disaster after all. If he played it right, this could work in his favor-even though he lost the bet. He stepped forward.	"My grandmother's been sick, and Christina's been doing everything to take care of her. Christina is an amazing wife. I'm truly grateful for everything she's done for my family..."



Calvin's brows knit together. Wife? Christina had never said she was married. And judging by how these three treated her, something felt off.Turning to Christina, he asked, "Is he your husband?"
###Chapter 94 A House
Brendon cast a nervous look at Christina,hoping she would play along and lie.


Christina, however, had no plans to play his game. She calmly spilled out the truth. "No.He's my ex-husband."


A deep frown crept across Brendon's face as he glared at her, barely containing his annoyance.He could never get used to how blunt she was.Instead of helping smooth things over, she always chose to be honest, no matter how uncomfortable it made everyone.



Calvin picked up on her words and offered Brendon a mocking grin. "So, ex-husband," he said, his tone dripped with sarcasm. "You're such a smooth talker. If Christina hadn't cleared things up, I might have actually thought you two were the picture-perfect couple, so loving and supportive of each other."
A flush crept up Brendon's cheeks as the sting from Calvin's remark left him feeling exposed.


"Dr. Emmett, I think you misunderstand.Brendon has always been fair to Christina. He made sure she received what she was owed,"Yolanda chimed in, her voice gentle as she tried to defend Brendon.



"Did he give her half of the family assets?"Calvin asked, his tone sharp.


The direct question took Yolanda by surprise,and she fell silent, unable to find a reply.


Calvin sneered, "Who would care about that small amount? Even if you gave her half of everything, you're far from treating her fairly."


Calvin's eyes swept over everyone before finally settling on Brendon. It was clear that Brendon had no idea what he had lost. In truth, maybe letting Christina go was the most correct thing Brendon had ever done. Someone as remarkable as Christina needed a partner who could see her true worth. Judging by their
clueless expressions, it was obvious they had no clue about Christina's discreet identity.


This thought brought the faintest smile to Calvin's lips. It seemed Christina hadn't planned to reveal she was actually the legendary healer,King. He could not wait for the day when they found out the truth. He imagined the shock on their faces would be unforgettable.



"You believe Christina has been treated unfairly? But Brendon has already given her five million and provided her with two houses.Wouldn't you say that's sufficient? Christina knows nothing aside from taking care of chores,and that's it. She has more than enough now to guarantee she can live well from here on out."Katie, unable to remain silent, quickly spoke up in Brendon's defense.



Calvin's response was a chilly laugh. "Some people's shamelessness knows no limits."


"Wait. Seriously? How did that make me shameless..." Katie retorted, her words thick
with contempt.


"Katie!" Brendon snapped, shooting her a furious glare. "Can't you be quiet for a while?"


Brendon knew he had to stop Katie from running her mouth. Only a little while earlier,they had been apologizing profusely, and Calvin still hadn't forgiven them. If Katie kept stirring things up, she would only make matters worse for everyone.



Anger simmered inside Katie, but she bit her tongue and said nothing more.


"Dr.Emmett, Christina accepted the settlement.At that time, I even considered giving her one more house," Brendon said, turning to Calvin and lowering his voice in an attempt to ease the tension.



Calvin looked at him, arching an eyebrow. "Is that so? Which house did you have in mind?"


Brendon managed a strained smile. "It would be up to Christina. Whichever one she liked best."
"Why not the seaside villa atBayview Estates?"Christina said, her response immediate and her voice carrying a chill.


Brendon tensed up for a moment, clearly surprised she would ask so directly.


Katie could not hold back her outrage. "How could you even suggest that? That villa was supposed to go to Yolanda! Don't you have any shame?"



"It's not like I begged you to give me anything,"Christina replied, folding her arms and flashing them a small, knowing smile. "Your brother was the one offering me a house and letting me choose. Now that l've picked, you're angry about it? If you didn't want to give, you should've kept quiet instead of acting generous."



"You!" Katie's temper boiled over, and she nearly lunged at Christina before Brendon quickly stopped her.


"Brendon." Yolanda moved closer, her eyes
shimmering with tears that had not yet fallen.She spewed words she didn't mean at all again."If Christina desires that house, then just let her have it. Honestly, it's alright. I don't mind it."Pausing, she added, "I am perfectly capable of earning money myself. However, the only thing Christina knows how to do is housework, and that is all. If she spends money recklessly, life outside might be tough for her. After everything she's done as a housewife for you for so many years,giving her a bit more is the least we can do."


Calvin was ready to respond, but before he could speak, Christina's voice rang out,silencing the room.
###Chapter 95 Apologize And Transfer Money To Her
"Then, thank you,Brendon. Please transfer the ownership of the three properties to me as soon as possible, so you can't back out later,"Christina said with a faint smile. She paid no mind to Yolanda's snide remarks. All that mattered to her was getting something real-something in hand. They could talk all they wanted. She couldn't care less.


Brendon's expression stayed cold. "Don't worry.You'll get what's yours."


"That's reassuring to hear," Christina replied calmly.


While Christina was unfazed, Calvin was seething. His chest tightened with rage. These fools had kept a medical legend trapped in the role of a housewife for years! Worse, they showed no appreciation for whatever she had
contributed to the household altogether. If Christina hadn't preferred to keep her identity as the legendary healer King under wraps, he would've revealed the truth and made them regret it for life.



"Pay up now. You lost the five-million bet,"Christina said, eyes locked on Brendon.


Brendon glanced at Calvin, who was staring at him intently. Gritting his teeth, he transferred five million to her. "That settles it," he muttered,barely holding back his fury.


Katie shot Christina a deadly glare. The frustration in her eyes was plain. To her,Christina was nothing but a blackmailer.What burned more was that there was nothing they could do about it.



Yolanda clenched her fists behind her back, her chest tight with bitterness. The house and the money should've been hers. But she wasn't alone in that pain-Brendon and Katie felt like they'd been cut open.
"Apologize now as per the bet demands,"Christina said after receiving the money.


"Sorry. We were wrong. I hope you won't hold it against us," Brendon said, lowering his head.


Katie wanted to snap, but when she saw Brendon bow, she had to do the same. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have spoken to you like that.Please forgive me."



Christina didn't even look at them properly. Her voice was flat."Alright."


Her indifference made Katie's blood boil. But she couldn't explode-not now. She swallowed her anger, her breathing shaky.


"Christina, they've already apologized. Can't you just forgive them? We're not enemies. Why make it worse?" Yolanda stepped in, making another feigned attempt to smooth things over while actually aiming to make Christina look vindictive.



"Why don't you just mind your own business?"
Christina shot her a sharp look of contempt.


Yolanda's fake smile froze. She hadn't expected such a blunt response, and it left her utterly humiliated.



Calvin, who had remained expressionless till now, quietly gave Christina an approving glance.


Just then, the doors to the emergency room opened. Doctors and nurses began walking out.When they saw Calvin, they stopped in their tracks. Shock and awe crossed their faces.Some opened their mouths but were too stunned to speak.


"Dr. Emmett!" someone finally cried out, voice shaking with excitement. The others quickly found their voices.



"Dr. Emmett, what brings you here?" one asked eagerly, barely containing their excitement.


"I came to check on the patient," Calvin said.


His reply drew a few curious glances toward Christina. They already knew she was the one
who invited him here and somehow convinced him to delay surgery for a major figure. It was clear her connection with Calvin was something extraordinary.


Seizing the rare chance, one of the doctors hesitated before asking, "Dr. Emmett, I've been stuck on a case. Would you have time for a discussion later?"


Calvin nodded. "Sure. I'll be around for a few days. If you run into any issues, feel free to ask."


"Thank you, Dr. Emmett!" the doctors beamed,nearly bouncing with joy.


After checking on Bethel, Calvin turned to Christina."She's stable for now. But it's best not to upset her again. Emotional stress will only slow her recovery."


"Understood." Christina nodded and then faced Brendon. "You heard him. Stick to your word and leave her in peace until the surgery."
###Chapter 96 Becoming Mrs. Hubbard
"Why should-" Katie was mid-sentence when Brendon cut her off. She threw her hand up in frustration, shooting a withering look at Christina.



"Fine. I'll agree," Brendon said, his voice gentler now. "Just take care of my grandma."


"I will," Christina replied, her tone frosty, her eyes distant. There was no warmth in her words.



Brendon shifted uncomfortably. The chill in her voice stung, but he still clung to the hope of mending things so that he could establish a connection with someone as powerful as Calvin.



After Bethel regained consciousness, Brendon left her hospital room with Yolanda and Katie.



The moment they returned to Brendon's ward,Katie's fury erupted like a storm.
wny are we even listening to Christina?" she snapped, seething with anger.


Brendon turned sharply,fixig Katie with a stern glare. "Because she knows Dr. Emmett. You can't keep lashing out at her like that."


Katie folded her arms, defiant. "Who knows how they even know each other? For all we know,there might be something shady going on between them." she spat out, dissatisfied, as she started to spread rumors.


"Katie, that's not fair," Yolanda said gently, her brows knitting together as she feigned disagreement. "We don't know their relationship. No matter how close they are,we shouldn't jump to conclusions."


Katie turned toward her, frustration bubbling just beneath the surface. "You're too soft,Yolanda. If you keep letting things slide,Christina's going to bleed the Dawson family dry."②


"L..." Yolanda's gaze fell to the floor, her voice
barely above a whisper, her next words calculated to make her appear gentle and considerate. "I just want Brendon. As for the Dawson family's assets, Brendon can give them to whoever he wants. Whatever decision Brendon makes, I'll support him, as long as he doesn't let you suffer."


Katie's eyes shimmered with emotion, touched by Yolanda's quiet devotion. "Yolanda, you're too good.If Christina had even a shred of your kindness and consideration, we wouldn't be drowning in all this chaos."


Yolanda gave her a mild, mock-scolding glance."Don't talk like that. Christina has her own merits too."



"Merits?" Katie scoffed with an icy laugh. "She's just a housewife who only knows how to scrub dishes. She's not even in your league."



Yolanda offered a soft smile. "Christina's actually a great shot, isn't she? DidIn't she win a championship once? I think that's pretty
impressive."



"Impressive?" Katie snorted. "Please. She probably slept with the shooting range owner to rig the competition. No way she earned that title fair and square."



Brendon stiffened. Her words dragged his mind back to that very competition-the image of Christina, poised and fierce, a far cry from the quiet, unremarkable woman he thought he knew. The memory lingered, unshakable.



"Yolanda!" Katie's tone sweetened as she hooked her arm through Yolanda's with affection. "Didn't you always dream of becoming a fashion designer?"


Yolanda tilted her head. "Yes, I did. Why?"


"I just heard something exciting," Katie said,lowering her voice like she was sharing a secret."The Hubbard Group is about to launch a fashion design competition. First prize? You become their lead designer and the Hubbard family's exclusive stylist."
Yolanda paused, taken aback, before regaining her composure with a smile. "Where did you hear that? I haven't heard anything about the Hubbard Group hosting a fashion design competition."



"My friend knows Mr. Hubbard's cousin-he let it slip," Katie whispered with a conspiratorial wink.



"It sounds like fun. If it's true, let's enter together. It's not about winning. Just participating would be amazing." Yolanda's eyes sparkled, though she masked the fire beneath her calm expression.



"Fun?" Katie threw her head back with a laugh."No, no, no-you have to win. Once you're the Hubbard family's designer, you'll get me in the door. And once I'm close to Mr. Hubbard..." Her eyes gleamed as she clutched her hands to her chest like a girl dreaming of her fairy-tale prince."Boom!Mrs.Hubbard!"



Katie twirled dramatically, already swept away
by the fantasy. "Once I'm Mrs. Hubbard,the Dawson family will be untouchable. And when that happens, I swear I'll buy you a super-yacht.We'll throw yacht parties every day like queens!"
###Chapter 97 Her Images Flashed In His Mind Again
Yolanda kept a pleasant smile on her face, but she was scoffing at Katie inwardly. Katie, that fool, actually wanted her help to become Mrs.Hubbard? What a joke. If she ever had a shot at climbing that high, she'd never hand the opportunity to someone else.



"Yolanda, you have to help me," Katie said,clinging to her arm and giving it a playful shake,completely unaware of the flicker of disdain in Yolanda's eyes.



Yolanda smiled sweetly and patted Katie's head."Don't worry. If I win the championship, I'll definitely help you win Mr. Hubbard over."



"Thank you, Yolanda! You're the best!" Katie beamed, resting her head on Yolanda's shoulder, her face glowing with joy.
Off to the side, Brendon stood quietly, lost in thought. Christina's smile kept replaying in his mind. Since leaving the Dawson family/,she had changed. The stiffness she once carried was gone-now, she walked with quiet confidence.The image of her dazzling smile made his heart skip a beat. Strange emotions stirred inside him,ones he didn't fully understand.



"Brendon?" Katie's brow furrowed. She nudged him and raised her voice. "Brendon!"



"Huh?" He blinked, snapping out of his daze.His gaze shifted to the two women. "What is it?"


"What were you thinking about? You looked completely zoned out," Katie asked,watching him closely.


"Nothing," he muttered, quickly burying the feelings that had just surfaced. "What were you saying?"


"I said the Hubbard Group is organizing a fashion design competition. Yolanda and I are joining," Katie replied.
"That's good," Brendon said distractedly.


Yolanda noticed the way his mind wandered and clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms. It seemed he was thinking about that wretched Christina.



"And that's it? No encouragement for us?" Katie teased, nudging him with a grin.


"If you both make it into the top ten, I'll give you each a hundred thousand," Brendon said flatly.


"Deal!" Katie cheered, flashing a wink at Yolanda.



Yolanda smiled and gently tapped Katie's forehead. But deep inside, her eyes flashed with fierce determination. She was going to win that championship. That was her chance to get closer to the Hubbard family. The Dawson family was nothing compared to the prestigious Hubbard family. If she could establish a connection with the Hubbards, there was no way she'd stay stuck in the Dawson circle.
When Christina walked into the private room of Morfort Restaurant, Lauretta Gomez, the mother of the child whom Christina had paid the medical bills upfront, and Calvin were already waiting.


"Sorry I'm late," Christina said with a small,apologetic smile.


"You're not late at all. We just got here,"Lauretta said warmly.


"Come, have a seat," Calvin chimed in,motioning Christina to join them as he began the introductions.



Raising her glass of red wine, Lauretta stood up."Miss Jones, I'd like to toast to you. If it weren't for you, my son might not have made it..."


"It was just good fortune that Dr. Emmett happened to be at the hospital," Christina said modestly, standing to clink glasses with her.


"Even so, I owe you more than words can say,"
Lauretta said in a sincere voice.



After finishing her drink, Lauretta turned and toasted Calvin as well. "You both saved my son's life. I'll never forget it," she said, placing two bank cards on the table. "There's five million in each. It's just a small token of my appreciation."



Lauretta had already reimbursed Christina for the hospital costs-this was beyond that. A gesture straight from the heart.


"Ms. Gomez, that's far too generous," Christina said, gently pushing the card back toward her."I don't want money. I only have one small favor to ask."
###Chapter 98 Unless King Performed The Surgery
Initially, Lauretta suspected Christina's hesitation stemmed from dissatisfaction with the sum offered, prompting her to consider a higher amount. But who would have guessed that Christina was asking for her help with something instead? Declining a generous five-million offer in exchange for help signaled that the favor Christina needed was no trivial matter.


Lauretta leaned back slightly, cautious. "WVhat exactly do you want from me?"


Christina noticed the wariness in Lauretta's voice and gave a calm smile. "I need your help to uncover information about Woodfort. I'm prepared to compensate you accordingly."


Christina recognized that Lauretta was no ordinary person. Lauretta's grandfather had once commanded troops, and her younger
brother was already a major general. Their family wielded power that outshone even the most elite circles. With such a background,Lauretta had grown up sharp, observant, and always on alert. Naturally, she didn't trust easily.



Lauretta paused, caught off guard by how simple Christina's request was-just help digging up information on Woodfort. "What do you need Woodfort for?" she asked.



Christina's expression turned serious. "It's for Dylan's sister. She's being treated by Dr.King-the famous healer-but her treatment is missing one final ingredient."


Woodfort was derived from a rare plant notorious for its toxicity, yet its root possessed remarkable healing properties. Given the plant's scarcity and the difficulty involved in harvesting its root, obtaining it was an extraordinary challenge.



"You mean Chloe is sick?" Lauretta asked, her tone changing. Having only just returned to the
country, she hadn't been privy to this detait, A condition severe enough to warrant the King's attention must be grave indeed. But it surprised her that the Scott family had actually brought someone like King on board.



"Yes," Christina confirmed with a nod."That's why I need your help to find Woodfort."


Lauretta hesitated, her expression troubled. "lf this were a few years ago, I'd have helped you in a heartbeat. But now..." She gave a faint, bitter smile. "I don't have those kinds of connections anymore. I left my family five years ago and moved overseas. I haven't spoken to any of them since. All I have now is money-not influence.I'm really sorry."



Christina looked slightly surprised but then nodded with understanding. "That's alright. If you happen to come across anything, just let me know."



"Very well, I'll keep watch for you," Lauretta said gently, sliding the bank card toward Christina.
"You should keep this."


Before Christina could respond, Calvin's voice interrupted the moment. "Lauretta, you should go back and visit your family."


Calvin sighed quietly.


Lauretta's expression shifted. "Mr. Emmett, can we not talk about that right now?" she said,clearly uncomfortable.


Calvin exhaled. "I'm only saying this because I'm worried you'll regret it someday. Did you know your father is unwell? I intended to travel to Lorbridge to perform surgery on him, but chance led me to cross paths with you instead."


Lauretta's body stiffened, and her hand holding the fork visibly trembled. Slowly, she shifted her gaze to meet Calvin's.



"His condition isn't good," Calvin continued, his voice heavy. "Honestly, I can't guarantee he'll even make it through the operation."



He wasn't being dramatic-he truly wasn't
confident about the outcome. But if Christina got to perform the surgery, the chances would improve significantly.


Lauretta's fingers tightened around the fork.Her mind raced with memories of her father.A deep bitterness began to well up inside her. She felt like she'd failed as a daughter. It had been years since she last contacted her family. Pride had built an invisible barrier, preventing her from reaching out. She had naively hoped that time alone might heal the fractures between them, but she had never considered the possibility of unforeseen circumstances. The mere thought of losing her father without one last farewell tightened a painful knot inside her heart,leaving her restless and unsettled.


"Even you are not confident about the surgery?"Lauretta asked, her eyes searching Calvin's face.



He slowly shook his head. "Yes. But if King did the surgery, there'd be a better chance. Maybe an eighty percent success rate. Still not a
guarantee-but much better odds."


A flicker of hope stirred within Lauretta. "lf |help King acquire Woodfort, could I persuade King to undertake the case?"



Calvin cast a discreet glance at Christina. "It's hard to say. King doesn't care about power or money. No one really knows what motivates King."


Calvin knew full well that Christina wouldn't be swayed under any circumstances, and her consent only came willingly.


Christina, who had been quietly listening, finally spoke up. "King will be in touch with me soon.How about I ask if King is on board?"


"Really? King will reach out to you?" Lauretta's eyes sparkled with hope.


"Yes." Christina nodded and then briefly "explained" how she had secured King's help for Chloe's treatment.


"| see," Lauretta said with a nod. "I'll do
everything I can to find Woodfort. If I succeed,I'll offer it in exchange for King to perform the surgery on my father."


Christina nodded thoughtfully. "I'll make sure King hears your request."


"Thank you," Lauretta said sincerely, lifting her glass in a quiet toast of gratitude.


By the time Lauretta walked Christina out of Morfort Restaurant, the sky had darkened,and the evening air had cooled.


A gentle breeze brushed against Christina's face, tugging loose strands of her hair. Beneath the streetlamp's glow, her silhouette shimmered softly, her presence quietly commanding attention despite the stillness.


Just then, a sleek black Maybach rolled up to the curb. Christina assumed the driver had arrived and moved to greet him, but then a tall figure in a tailored black suit stepped out,radiating an air of effortless elegance. It was Dylan.
Christina widened her eyes slightly. She had only called for the driver. What was Dylan doing here?



Slightly intoxicated from the wine, Christina smiled warmly as she closed the distance between them. "You-" Her words cut short as her high heel unexpectedly caught on the uneven pavement, sending her staggering forward in an unsteady falter.
###Chapter 99 You Smell Amazing
Dylan rushed forward and caught Christina just in time, steadying her as her high heel snagged on the step. One arm wrapped around her waist, their faces only inches apart.



Christina clung to Dylan, arms looped tightly around his neck, her body slightly tilted balanced only by his hold.



Their eyes locked, and for a moment, it felt like their noses might brush. Warm breath passed between them, only occasionally broken by the whisper of a passing breeze.



A soft gust lifted a few loose strands of Christina's hair, brushing them gently across her flushed cheeks.



The faint scent of wine lingered on her breath, mixing with her natural fragrance into something delicate, intoxicating.


Maybe it was the wine on her breath-or
maybe something more-but Dylan felt lightheaded, his breathing unsteady. Her skin glowed under the light, and up close, every feature of her face seemed impossibly beautiful. He couldn't tear his eyes off her.


Thump. Thump. Christina couldn't tell whose heartbeat echoed louder-hers or his-but one thing was certain: Dylan looked devastatingly dashing up close. "Has anyone ever told you how ridiculously handsome you are?" she asked with a playful smile, her voice low and unguarded.



Dylan didn't answer right away. His exporession remained stoic, lips pressed into a firm line as he gazed at her.


"Why the poker face all the time? Come on,smile a little," she teased, lifting a hand and gently poking the corner of his mouth.



The edge of Dylan's mouth lifted into a faint smile.



"There it is. You look even better when you smile," Christina beamed.
Maybe it was the alcohol talking, but something about him made her bolder, more curious. She leaned in a little closer, drawing in a breath. "You smell amazing," she murmured.



Dylan blinked."What?"


"I said, you smell amazing," she repeated,laughing softly as she buried her face in the curve of his neck and breathed him in again.


His scent was warm and clean, addictive.It wrapped around her like a spell. Something stirred inside her, deep and sudden-like a restlessness she couldn't quite suppress.



Her nose grazed his neck, cold against his skin, and the contrast made his body stiffen.A shiver ran through him, and his Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed hard.



The air between them thickened, heated by their closeness and quiet breaths.



Desire coiled inside Dylan, sharp and sudden, dangerously hard to ignore. He inhaled deeply, trying to steady himself.His
voice was rough as he finally spoke. "You've had too much to drink."



"I'm not drunk," Christina whispered, eyes gleaming with mischief.


"You-" Dylan started, but she cut him off with a soft press of her finger against his lips.



"Shh." Her smile deepened. "I'm really not drunk."



She wasn't lying. Tipsy, yes. But not drunk.Just bold, curious, and fearlessly drawn to him.



Dylan stared at her, thrown off balance. A resigned smile touched his lips. A tipsy Christina was even more endearing than usual.


"Don't believe me?" she asked, tilting her head,studying his face.


"I believe you," Dylan said quietly.


"You don't look like you believe me." She scrunched her nose and leaned forward,pressing her forehead against his.
Dylan tensed again. His hand at her waist tightened as their closeness pushed him to the edge. Her touch. Her warmth.Her scent.


"I'll show you I'm not drunk," she said, pulling back just enough to meet his eyes.


"How?" he asked, voice husky, throat tightening, his Adam's apple rising once more.



Christina's lips curled into a slow, teasing smile as she leaned in, inch by inch, closing the space between them.
###Chapter 100 Almost Kissed
Dylan's breath grew heavier, a little quicker,as he struggled to rein in the storm inside him. His lips inched toward Christina's,instinctively drawn to the warmth between them.



But just as Dylan thought their lips would meet, Christina pulled away.


He froze, caught off guard, his brows knitting ever so slightly in annoyance.


Before he could speak, Christina slipped out of his arms and kicked off her heels without warning.


Alarmed, Dylan stretched his long legs and caught her hand just in time, fearing she might bolt toward the street. "Where do you think you're going?" His voice was low, husky -tinged with worry and resignation.



"I'm proving I'm not drunk!" Christina declared with a tiny hiccup.
"And how exactly do you plan on doing that?" he asked, his tone softening.


"Let's race. I bet I can outrun you," she said,eyes bright with playful confidence.



Dylan stared at the pink flush on her cheeks for a moment, and then, without a word,swept her off her feet.



"Hey! We didn't even start running yet. Are you cheating?" Christina frowned.



Dylan chuckled under his breath. "It's too late now. The race is postponed till tomorrow."



When he didn't get a response, he looked down and met her unwavering gaze. "What?"he asked.



"Nothing. I just think you have a really nice smile. You should show it more," she said with a gentle smile.


He didn't reply, but a brief, quiet smile tugged at the corners of his lips as he carried her forward, pausing only to pick up
her abandoned heels.



Whenever Christina drank, she carried a certain childlike charm-unguarded,free.



He placed her gently in the passenger seat.As he reached over to fasten her seatbelt,her fingers suddenly curled around his tie.


He frowned slightly and reached to pull it free, but before he could, she tugged sharply, drawing him close.



His body was pulled forward, and he braced himself against the seat to keep from crashing into her. Their faces hovered just inches apart.


At that moment, the world around them fell quiet. Only the sound of their breath and the thudding of their hearts filled the silence. It felt like time had stopped.



"Why aren't you smiling?" she asked softly,her brow creased with mild frustration.



Dylan hesitated and then forced a smile-but it came out stiff and unsure. He wasn't
someone who smiled easily.



"That's better," Christina said with a satisfied grin. "You look even more handsome when you smile." She let go of his tie and settled back in the seat.



"Get some rest. We'll be there soon," Dylan said quietly.



"Alright." She closed her eyes without protest. Within seconds, her breathing evened out, and she drifted to sleep.


By the time Dylan arrived at her home, she was sound asleep.



"Mr. Scott," Aylin greeted with a respectful bow, flanked by a few household staff.


Dylan gave a slight frown and waved them off. They took the hint and quietly stepped away.



Not wanting to wake Christina, Dylan gently lifted her in his arms and carried her upstairs.He placed her carefully on the bed, pulling the covers over her sleeping form.
As he looked down at her peaceful face,something stirred in his chest. A strange heat.He swallowed hard and tugged at his tie, trying to compose himself.



He allowed himself one last glance-then quietly turned and slipped out, closing the door behind him.



Back in his own place, Dylan opened his wardrobe. His eyes landed on a white shirt hanging neatly inside, marked faintly with a lipstick stain. The moment in the car flashed across his mind-their closeness, their breath mingling in the silence. He could still feel the ghost of her lips against his. His thoughts spiraled,tangled and loud.



He reached for the white shirt, hesitated, and hung it back again. Then, without a word, he headed into the bathroom. After washing up,he stood at the sink, gripping its edges,staring at his own reflection. His sharp features were unreadable, but his eyes burned with something unspoken. And then her voice echoed in his mind-soft, tipsy,and filled with laughter.
###Chapter 101 Lauretta's Reconciliation Call
Christina's voice, warm and gentle, echoed in Dylan's mind, her smile still vivid in his memories. "See? There's something about your smile-it really suits you. I honestly think you look your best when you let yourself smile. You should do it more often."



Dylan gazed into the mirror. Rigid features stared back at him, eyes sharp and almost unyielding.



A long moment passed before he attempted to coax a smile onto his lips, trying to follow her advice. The result, however, felt anything but natural. Frustration pulled his brows together as the awkward grin quickly faded.



Determined,he made several more attempts,each time the smile softening ever so slightly, though it never quite matched what he hoped for. In contrast, Christina's laughter
always seemed so easy and beautiful-her joy radiated without effort.


Still, Dylan found himself rooted before the mirror, practicing again and again,determined to capture just a hint of that warmth.Anyone familiar with him would have been utterly floored by the sight.







Inside a quiet hospital room, Lauretta, feeling the haze of a few drinks, tapped in the same familiar number again and again, but hesitation stopped her from making the call.Time after time, she would erase the digits,her tired eyes falling to her sleeping child beside her.



Nearly half a decade had passed since she'd made her decision, walking away from her family, burning every bridge as she started over in a distant land.



Over the years, Lauretta had erased every way her family could reach her, maintaining complete silence for half a decade.
Old memories resurfaced whenever she thought of her father-his stern ways, the strict rules, but also the deep love he'd always shown her. The ache from those recollections was sharp. With hindsight, she wondered if she'd been too unforgiving in her decisions.



Back then, when having fun abroad, she had had a one-night stand with a stranger whose identity remained a mystery to her. Initially,she'd chalked it up to a fleeting encounter,nothing more. But three months later, her world shifted-she discovered she was carrying a child.



Questions from her father had been relentless, but shame silenced her. She had invented a story about a boyfriend, unwilling to admit the truth behind her son's conception. She'd lied that their relationship had ended, stubbornly "protecting" her supposed boyfriend's identity.



Outrage had exploded from her father when he realized her engagement with the Norris
family was at risk.


Arranged marriage had always been a cage for Lauretta-she'd fought it for years,pleading with her father to break things off.But he would not yield. Such a move, he insisted, would spark conflict between their families and ruin their reputation.



Things had changed when she became pregnant. Lauretta had seized the chaos,insisting it was time to call off the engagement. Her father, however, stood his ground-he demanded she end the pregnancy.



Honestly, when those first test results came in, she had considered terminating the pregnancy. But her resolve wavered the moment she saw the small, flickering heartbeat on the ultrasound. She knew she couldn't give her baby up.



Strength had always been Lauretta's hallmark-she never needed a husband, but she knew she wanted this baby. Confidence in her ability to raise a child on her own never
wavered.



Yet, her father had been unyielding, issuing threats of disowning her if she refused to end the pregnancy. Presented with that stark choice, she had walked away from the Gomez family without a backward glance.



Those memories brought a sting to her eyes as she looked lovingly at her son, tears silently slipping down her cheeks. Her hand reached out, fingers gently curling around his tiny one. She regretted not ever reaching out to her family in the past five years, but she didn't regret keeping her son.



Calvin's words echoed in her mind, giving her the strength to exhale deeply and finally press the call button to her father's number.



Ringing filled her ears-uncertainty creeping in, she almost wavered and hung up, her finger tremboling above the screen. But before she could act, the call connected.



"Hello?" That familiar voice crackled through the line, wearier and rougher with age.
Lauretta's throat clenched, hot tears streaming down her face. A shaky hand covered her mouth, muffling the sobs that threatened to escape.



Somehow, her father, Aldred Gomez, sensed it was her. "Lauretta? Is that you?"



Background noises filtered in-another voice,gentle and concerned. "Who's calling so late,dear? You need your rest. The operation is soon-just hang up if it's not important."



Lauretta's tears came harder, but she pressed her lips together, determined to stay silent and not let her heartbreak spill out.


Aldred's voice came again, softer now,threaded with hope. "Lauretta, is that really you?"


Emotion overwhelmed Lauretta at last, and a sob slipped past her lips.



Noise crackled on the other end-Lauretta's mother's voice rang out, trembling with shock and excitement. "Lauretta? Is it really you,sweetheart? Did our Lauretta finally
call?"



Tears thickened Lauretta's voice as she struggled to answer. "Yes, it's me. I'm so sorry."



Regret weighed heavy in Aldred's reply. "No,Lauretta, I'm the one who owes you an apology."



Sobs broke up Lauretta's words, but she insisted, "It wasn't your fault. I was being stubborn."



Urgency cut through as Lauretta's mother,Doris Gomez, jumped in, her question breathless. "Lauretta, where are you right now? Are you in Lorbridge?"



"No, I'm in Dorfield. Once Caspien gets better, we'll transfer him to a hospital in Lorbridge," Lauretta replied, wiping her cheeks.



Their surprise echoed down the line."Caspien?"



"Yes," Lauretta replied gently. "My son's
name is Caspien. Your grandson."


Stunned silence lingered for a heartbeat as Aldred processed the news, his resistance already beginning to thaw.


Doris, however, wasted no time. "Tell me,Lauretta, what's wrong with Caspien? Is he alright?"
