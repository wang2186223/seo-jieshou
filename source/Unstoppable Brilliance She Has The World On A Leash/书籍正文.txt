
###Chapter 1 Cast Out



"Grace, now that my parents have finally brought me home,do you actually believe there's still room for you here? The truth is, there's no space for you in this family." Demi Miller's mouth twisted into a sly grin as she leaned closer and spoke in a low, menacing tone beside the pool.


When she finished, she suddenly toppled backward into the sparkling water, sending up a flurry of splashes.


Chaos broke loose as she flailed her arms and kicked wildly, as if she were on the verge of drowning.


"Somebody help! I can't get out!" Her screams rang out,her voice full of panic.


Across the pool, Grace Miller stood quietly, her expression as cold as stone. There was not a flicker of warmth or concern in her eyes as she watched Demi's frantic struggle.


Today marked the grand homecoming celebration that Luke and Ivy Miller had thrown for their long-lost daughter,Demi.


Eighteen years had slipped by since the day Demi
that Luke and Ivy Miller had thrown for their long-lost daughter,Demi.


Eighteen years had slipped by since the day Demi vanished at birth. Even after endless searching, the couple had found nothing. Later, they adopted Grace.


Nobody could have guessed that Demi would resurface as an adult, suddenly making Grace's place in the family seem unnecessary.


"Demi!" lvy yelled from inside the villa. She burst outside,Luke close behind, panic etched on both their faces.


With a sharp, accusing stare, lvy's gaze bounced between her daughter thrashing in the water and Grace, who stood at the edge. "Grace! How could you?Why would you shove Demi into the pool?"


Luke didn't hesitate. He leaped into the pool,leaving Ivy jabbing her finger at Grace. "Leave this house! You don't belong here!"



"I didn't lay a hand on her," Grace replied with a calm indifference, her voice steady and almost detached."Demi jumped in all by herself."


"That's a lie!" lvy's voice shook with anger."Why would she jump in herself? We opened our home to you, and this is how you repay our kindness?"
By then, Luke had managed to lift Demi out of the pool.

Soaked and trembling in her father's arms, Demi blinked away tears and murmured, "Please don't blame Grace. This happened because of me. Maybe I shouldn't have come home at all."


She looked like a fragile bird caught in a storm,shivering slightly.

With deep affection, lvy pulled Demi close and whispered, "Demi, your kindness never fails to touch me."


Her tone sharpened as she faced Grace. "Go pack your belongings and leave this house right away."

Quiet uncertainty flickered across Luke's face. He dropped his voice and tried to reason. "When we took Grace in, we made a promise to the orphanage director to treat her well. Maybe there's some misunderstanding..."


Snapping before he could finish, lvy retorted, "What is there to misunderstand? It was our own daughter who nearly drowned. No one was around! Are you honestly saying Grace had nothing to do with it?"

Left with no argument, Luke let out a defeated sigh.He nodded and gave in. "Alright, we'll arrange for
Grace to leave."


After a moment, he dialed Ella Fowler, the woman who ran the orphanage.


Their decision to adopt Grace came at a time when they needed it most. Thanks to the adoption, they received financial support of three hundred thousand dollars, which arrived just in time to save them from hardship.


With Demi's reappearance, Grace no longer fit into the family's plans. Perhaps it was best for everyone if she was sent away.


Grace watched the scene from a distance, her expression cool and unreadable.


Tall and elegant, she stood apart, her face stunning but aloof. Yet, not a flicker of pain or resentment shone in her gaze-there was only a strange,unshakable peace.


After hanging up, Luke fidgeted awkwardly. "Grace,Ms. Fowler will be here soon. Take everything we bought for you-and here's a grand."


"I don't want it," Grace interrupted flatly.


Nestled in Ivy's arms, Demi's eyes sparkled with satisfaction. In a tone laced with innocence, she chimed in, "Grace, do you still feel bad that I've come
home? All I want is to be close to my parents and be the daughter they deserve..."


"You poor thing, it's Grace who owes you an apology.She's the one who took your spot all these years," lvy said,her voice full of sympathy.


Grace cast a steady, unreadable look at both lvy and Luke. "You both know the truth. I never laid a hand on her."


Their faces tightened at her accusation, but blood ties always took precedence. It was clear which side they would choose.


"There's nothing left to discuss. What's done is done,"Luke replied, frowning.


Ready to lash out, lvy barely had time to speak before voices echoed from the front of the house.



A middle-aged woman crossed into view, speaking with careful respect. "Mr. Miller, I've comne to take Grace with me."



The statement caught Luke off guard for a second. He managed a nod. "Go on, Grace. Ms. Fowler will take care of you."


Making her way to Grace, Ella's eyes brimmed with warmth. "Come, sweetheart. None of this is your fault,and I'll do everything I can to help you find a real
home."


With gentle encouragement, she reached for Grace's hand. "Do you remember Julia Holden from your last visit to the orphanage? She's very fond of you. After hearing about what happened, she wants you to join her family."


A small flicker of emotion crossed Grace's eyes.Wasn't Julia the one who always wore a kind smile?


Kindness radiated from Ella as she continued, "Julia's family is already on their way. If you want, you can start fresh with her family."


Pausing, she added with quiet hope, "I believe you'll fit in much better there."



Only four more chances remained for Ella to help Grace find a place where she belonged. This was the last hope she could offer. If this didn't work out...


For a while, Grace stood quietly. Then, with a nod, she replied, "Alright."


Relief spread across Ella's face, her smile gentle and sincere.
###Chapter 2 New Family


Grace and Ella led the way, while the Millers followed close behind. Their faces put on a show of worry, but their eyes glimmered with a mean sort of amusement.


Curiosity sparkled within them. They were eager to witness just what kind of home would take Grace in.


In their minds, they pictured some struggling family,likely wanting an extra pair of hands for household chores.


Yet, all assumptions vanished the moment their attention shifted to the driveway.


A white car,paint dulled by time and emblazoned with the logo of a car rental company, waited along the curb. Next to it stood a tall man whose presence seemed to fill the space.


His hair looked tousled by the wind. Dust smudged his elegant silk shirt, but a commanding energy clung to him.



A flicker of recognition stirred in Grace's gaze. It took only a second to identify that shirt as something custom-tailored-a single garment that could have fed the Miller family for months.
Though she looked away, her mind spun with quiet certainty. Whoever he was, this man was anything but ordinary.


Meanwhile, Rodger Holden studied Grace for a moment, his gaze sharp. A flicker of surprise crossed his features.

He had imagined he would find a timid, anxious girl,but the young woman standing before him held her ground, calm and collected, meeting the moment without flinching.


He was intrigued.


Known as the driving force behind the Holden Group,Rodger's reputation stretched across the business world-a man far out of reach for people like the Millers.


His marriage to Julia was strong, and together they had raised two sons. Still, Julia longed for a daughter.


Half a year ago, Julia had met Grace at the orphanage and immediately felt a connection, but at that time,Grace had already been taken in by another family.Julia never truly let go of the hope that one day things might be different.

So when Ella called earlier today with unexpected news, Julia's happiness spilled over-she wept for joy
and sent Rodger to fetch Grace without a second thought.


Leaving behind a deal worth a fortune, Rodger dashed across town. On his way, fate tossed in a mishap;his car ended up wrecked, though he walked away without a scratch.



He hurriedly found a rental and sped toward the Miller family's home, setting the stage for the meeting that now unfolded.



Judging by Rodger's unremarkable clothes and the battered rental car, the Millers' sneers grew more obvious.



Their expectations had already been low for Grace's new family, but the reality appeared even more disappointing. The man's dirty shirt and the sight of the rental car only fueled that impression. It looked as though Grace's prospects were nothing but gloomy.


Watching it all unfold, Demi allowed herself a quiet,satisfied grin.


The truth was simple: she basked in her parents 'affection, the family's beloved daughter. As for Grace? Life ahead looked grim, and she seemed fated for a rough road with people barely scraping by.


Ella could not hide her surprise. Something felt off about this situation. As far as she remembered, Julia
came from a wealthy background, and every time they met, Julia showed nothing but generosity. She suspected there had to be a mistake somewhere.


She moved closer with Grace, her voice polite as she said, "Nice to meet you, Mr. Holden. I'd like you to meet Grace Miller."



When Rodger took a careful look at Grace,his good impression of her grew stronger.


It all made sense-why Julia had never stopped thinking about this girl. Sometimes, it came down to a feeling that couldn't be explained.



He was sure of it: their family and Grace belonged together.


With a gentle nod, he replied, "Yes, I remember. My wife told me all about her."



Ella let out a soft breath, relief settling in as she offered Grace a gentle pat on the shoulder. "Grace,meet Mr. Rodger Holden. He's Julia's husband."



Grace acknowledged the introduction,her eyes taking in Rodger's sharp looks and calm confidence. He wore a stern expression, but she sensed a quiet kindness underneath.



For reasons she couldn't name,she had a favorable feeling about him.
Still, there were others who felt differently.


Demi's mouth twitched as she put on a look of innocence and stepped forward. "Grace, did he arrive in a rental car? Should I have my dad loan you one?"



She batted her lashes, and her sweet tone did nothing to hide the teasing glint in her eyes.


Grace turned away, not sparing her a second glance."That won't be necessary. Rental cars are perfectly fine."



Luke let out an exaggerated sigh. "When you settle into your new home, try to be on your best behavior.Since your grades aren't impressive, at least make sure you don't make any trouble." His tone put Grace down.



Rodger's eyes met Luke's with a chilling steadiness,and his words cut through the air. "Academic performance isn't a concern for us. What matters is that my daughter lives a joyful life. We can afford to give her everything she needs."



The Miller family exchanged uneasy glances. They couldn't help but bristle at his boldness. While they weren't poor themselves, none of them would have dared to speak so boldly. How dare this man bluff before them? Wearing plain clothes and arriving in a rental car, who exactly was he trying to impress?
Demi, on the other hand, felt a secret thrill, thinking Grace would soon be left behind.


Right then, the air rumbled as the sound of engines approached. Three sleek black Rolls-Royce Phantoms pulled up behind Rodger,coming to a sharp halt.


At once, the doors swung open and a group of sharply dressed bodyguards stepped out. Their voices rang out clearly. "Sir, Mrs. Holden sent us to bring you and Miss Grace Miller home!"



Stunned, the Miller family stood rooted to the spot,their faces drained of color. Rolls-Royce cars?Uniformed bodyguards?


Demi stared at Rodger, eyes growing wide. Wait...Could this Rodger Holden be the same person who headed the influential Holden Group?
###Chapter 3 Meeting The Holdens



Ignoring the stunned expressions of the Millers,Rodger's stern look softened as he turned to Grace."Come along. Your mom is waiting for you at home."



Those words brought an odd rush of emotion that Grace hadn't felt before.



For a moment,she struggled to put the sensation into words. It felt as if winter's chill had brushed up against a warm sunbeam-strange and new,but she could not bring herself to pull away.


Ella's hand slipped into hers. With a quiet voice, she asked, "Grace, Mr. Holden is here for you. Do you want to go with him?"


Lifting her chin, Grace searched Rodger's face. Her tone was soft, but her question wvas direct. "Are you ever going to send me away without warning?"


Rodger felt a pang in his chest, one he had not expected. At first, adopting a daughter had meant little to him; he agreed only to satisfy his wife's hopes.For a family as wealthy as theirs, taking in a child was hardly a significant act.
Yet now, looking into Grace's anxious, stubborn eyes -the same eyes that reminded him of his wife-he realized he was determined to keep her as his own.


He moved a little closer, offering her a look that was both unwavering and kind. "Never. From this moment forward, you belong with the Holdens. That won't ever change."


Ella's tense shoulders relaxed as relief washed over her. She trusted that when Rodger gave his word,it was as good as set in stone.


With a small nod, Grace stepped forward. All around,the Miller family watched in shock as she headed toward the fleet of luxury cars that marked a life of privilege.


From this moment on, she would no longer be overlooked. She would be cherished and protected as the Holdens' beloved daughter.



Expressions of disbelief and uncertainty flickered across the faces of the Miller family.


Still, being freed of the responsibility of caring for Grace seemed like a blessing in disguise.


Moreover, among society's elite, nothing was ever simple. Grace's fiery spirit might soon see her returned to the orphanage-history had a way of repeating
itself.







Soon, the luxury cars made their way to the heart of the city.


Grace rested in silence, her backpack settled on her knees. Inside, she carried just a handful of clothes, a compact laptop, and a phone with a design all its own.


Out of the blue, her phone buzzed.


With a swift motion, she unlocked the screen and read an encrypted message. "So, Ms. Fowler set you up with a new family?" The words were cautious, almost hesitant.



She typed a simple response. "Yes."


Her habit of brief replies did not seem to bother the sender, who quickly followed up. "The Holdens have their own set of complications. Should we rethink things since they aren't part of our plan?"


Eyes lowered, she said nothing, lost in thought.


Moments ticked by before the next message appeared."Anyway, reach out if you need anything. Want me to take action on your behalf?"


Grace responded without hesitation, "Take back
everything I gave to the Millers. If they believe they can manage alone, let them."


Back when she had first joined the Miller family, she had poured her efforts into helping them. Their fortunes had soared because of her support.


Elsewhere in the car, Rodger's phone rang.He picked up, and Julia's warm voice spilled through the line,bubbling with excitement. "Sweetheart, is our daughter with you? Tell me what she enjoys eating,and I'll make sure the chef prepares her favorites!"


Catching Grace's reflection in the rearview mirror,Rodger's lips curved into a gentle smile. "Yes, she's here with me. She's truly one of a kind."


Hours passed as the car zipped down endless stretches of highway, finally slowing as their destination drew near.


Pinnacle Estates, the crown jewel of the city, was home to the Holden family. Only the city's most influential and wealthy could claim a place in this rarefied neighborhood.



Among properties where even a patch of land was considered a prize, the Holdens' home boasted sweeping gardens and an artificial lake that shimmered beneath the afternoon sun.



Years ago, Luke had dared to imagine calling this
neighborhood home, though such dreams had always been far out of reach.



Their luxury cars glided down a smooth driveway, and Grace peered through the window, taking in the estate's grand architecture that rivaled a royal palace.


Rodger stepped out first and walked around to open her door. He guided her along winding garden paths where every blossom seemed perfectly arranged.



Awaiting them inside, the rest of the Holden family had already gathered in the spacious living room.


At the center of it all, an older woman sat in the place of honor. Though she spoke not a word, her presence alone held everyone's attention.


Perfectly coiffed silver hair framed her face, and pearls glimmered at her ears-Ethel Holden, the respected head of the household.


To Ethel's right sat Carl, her eldest, joined by his own family. Rodger was her second son. The youngest,Eliana, now lived overseas with her husband. Beside Ethel stood a young girl in a crisp white dress, Gianna White, a relative Ethel had taken in.



"Mom, this is my daughter, Grace," Rodger said with unusual tenderness.



An immediate hush swept over the room.
With calm assurance, Grace lifted her head and met their gazes. Not a hint of unease touched her expression.



Her plain white blouse lent her an air of quiet confidence, striking even among the lavish surroundings.


For a brief second, the family was taken aback. They had expected a timid girl fresh from the orphanage,but the confidence she exuded left them speechless.



Unable to hold back any longer, Julia stepped forward in her flowing gown. Her arms closed tightly around Grace, her voice trembling with happiness. "Grace,I never imagined we would be brought together like this. My heart is so full. We're a family now, and nothing will change that."


She kept her secret to herself-that wish whispered every night, hoping Grace would be free again so she could give her a real home.


Wrapped in Julia's embrace, Grace caught the soft scent of iris perfume and felt a wave of comfort. For the first time, she realized what warmth truly meant.
###Chapter 4 Scorn


Energy sparkled in Julia's eyes as she squeezed Grace's hand. "Take a look! Grace's eyes are just like mine when I was a girl!"


With uncontained excitement, she turned to her husband. "Don't you think so,darling?"


Rodger's eyes flicked between his wife and Grace. The usual hardness in his expression faded, replaced by a rare softness. "There's no denying it. They really do resemble each other."



Maybe it was a mere coincidence, yet the likeness between Julia and Grace was uncanny from certain angles.


Both shared big eyes with a gentle tilt, matching noses, and jawlines that seemed cut from the same mold.


Julia couldn't hide her delight as she said, "We could pass for mother and daughter. Maybe this was always meant to be."


Sometimes, a single meeting was all it took to know someone belonged.
From the start, Julia had taken a liking to Grace,feeling an instant bond.


The others in the room, however, could hardly believe their ears. No blood ties connected them,yet Julia acted as if Grace were her own.



Unbothered by anyone else's opinion, Julia focused only on Grace, her words gentle. "I promise to love you dearly. You are my cherished daughter now."


Ethel, sitting nearby, watched Grace's entrance with a critical gaze and a frown.


To her, Grace's plain clothing and simple background stood out like a sore thumb. The girl had grown up in an orphanage, moving from one family to another,and had missed out on a proper education.


"The paperwork was finished. From that moment on,she belonged to the Holden family," Ethel said, her tone as cold as ice itself. "Make sure that once she settles in, someone teaches her howN to behave. The standards in this family are not for just anyone."


There was no mistaking the scorn that colored her words.


She had never agreed with this adoption. With Gianna already thriving-enrolled at a top school, always at the top of her class, and talented in the arts-what
was the point of bringing in a stranger with no background?


Despite Ethel's objections, Grace had found her way into the house. She blamed Julia for clouding Rodger's judgment. Frustration churned in Ethel's chest, and a storm gathered on her face.


"Please don't let this upset you, Grandma." Gianna came closer, her hand soft as she patted Ethel's back.Her voice was sweet as she said, "Grace is new here.We'll help her learn everything she needs."


She threw Grace a glance filled with silent mockery,the hint of a smile curling at the edge of her mouth.



Watching Grace stay calm, and seeing Julia fawn over her,made Gianna's blood boil.


Julia had always spoiled her, buying every luxury and chasing down the latest fashion just to see her smile.


With Grace now in the picture, Gianna felt the sting of jealousy.Would Julia's love stretch that far, or was she herself about to lose her place?


"Grace, you sure are awfully quiet tonight. Is there something wrong, or..." Gianna let her words linger,dropping heavy hints that Grace might not even be able to speak.



All eyes shifted in Grace's direction, only then noticing
she had not said a single thing since her arrival.


A look of contempt flickered in Gianna's gaze. She scoffed to herself, thinking Grace was probably stunned speechless by the grandeur around her.


Any worries about Grace coming back to threaten her place in the family faded away-it seemed those fears had been for nothing.


Remaining steady, Grace lowered her eyes in a gesture of respect. "I know my place. The elders are speaking,and I shouldn't interrupt."


Watching the family's back-and-forth felt like witnessing a play, so she found no space to join in.


Surprise flashed across the room. None of them expected such a thoughtful response-perhaps there was more to her than they assumed.


Gianna's expression soured as shesilently fumed.Was that a subtle jab at her?


Even Ethel's frosty exterior eased a touch. "You know how to behave. That's good."


Right then, the butler entered and announced, "Dinner is served."


Before long, the whole family was settling in at the dining table.
Julia made sure Grace took the seat right beside her.


Throughout the meal, she paid special attention to her new daughter, serving her the tastiest dishes.


Watching Grace savor each bite, Gianna's envy spiked as she glanced at her own plate.


Months of dieting just to stay slim had left her hungry and irritable.


Seeing Grace eat with such ease gnawed at her nerves,so she quickly shifted the conversation. "Grace, I heard you dropped out of high school. What do you plan to do? Wanna continue school? I know people at Crestwood High. Maybe I can help you get in."


Crestwood's reputation wasn't exactly stellar-most students lacked motivation and ambition, content to coast through their classes without putting in any real effort.



Bringing up Crestwood was nothing but a jab meant to put Grace in her place.


Before Grace could reply, Rodger spoke up. "I already arranged for her to enroll at Briskvale High. She'll be starting next week."


The entire family froze at his words.
Gianna's fake smile vanished, her eyes growing huge with shock. "Briskvale High?"


That school was legendary, reserved for the country's elite. Most families could only dream of sending their children there-how could someone from Grace's background possibly get in?


Trying to hide her jealousy, Gianna forced a smile and said, "Uncle Rodger, Briskvale isn't just open to anyone. You need more than connections to get accepted. Grace even dropped out of school, so how will that work?"
###Chapter 5 5 Unlimited Black Card



Briskvale High sat at the pinnacle of local education,famous for having some of the toughest entrance requirements in the city.


Throughout its long and storied history, the school had never once accepted a transfer student, let alone welcomed someone who had once dropped out of school.


Gianna's place at Briskvale had been earned through relentless effort, bolstered by her family background and stellar track record.



Casting a sidelong glance at Grace, Gianna sneered to herself as she watched the girl quietly savor her soup.Did this orphan honestly believe she could just stroll into a place like Briskvale High?


Only the brightest and most ambitious students filled those halls, and nearly every graduate went on to attend a top university.


Admitting someone who once dropped out of school?That would be an outright scandal.


Surely, the school wouldn't risk its legacy.
"Aunt Julia..."' Gianna put on a show of concern. "I heard Grace didn't have the best grades back in her hometown..."


She let her words hang in the air, eyes glittering with barely disguised mockery.


Julia took her time serving Grace another bowl of soup,her smile warm and reassuring. "There's nothing to worry about. Rodger donated an entire building to the school. The principal believes every student deserves a fair chance, so Grace is welcome to join."


Although Gianna forced a worried expression, her jaw clenched tight. "I'm only looking out for Grace.We had another student once who bought his way in,but he could not keep up and ended up having a tough time. The pressure pushed him into depression."


The thought of anyone at school linking her to Grace made Gianna bristle with embarrassment. She would never allow Grace to attend the same school as her.


For a split second, Rodger's features grew thoughtful,a hint of concern surfacing.


He hadn't fully considered the challenges Grace might face.


When he looked over at Grace, her wide and innocent eyes were fixed on him. That sweet look tugged at his
heartstrings.


"Grace." Rodger spoke in a softer tone than usual."If you ever feel overwhelmed, we can look into other schools. I've made donations to plenty of them..."


Setting her spoon down with a quiet clink, Grace met his gaze. "There's no need to worry," she replied softly. "If you believe Briskvale High is the right place,then I'll go. And just so you know, I'm not as hopeless as everyone thinks."


Something warm bloomed in Rodger's chest. How did he end up with a daughter so sensible?


Whether she was brilliant or not meant little to him-the family's fortune could give her a life of comfort forever.



All he wanted was to shield her from disappointment and give her every chance to be happy.


Rodger looked at Grace with a gentleness rarely seen in him. "All your mom and I wish for is that you find happiness and fulfillment in your life."


That sort of gentleness was a side he reserved only for his wife and now for his daughter.


Across the table, Gianna's grip on her fork tightened so much her knuckles blanched.
In her mind, Rodger and Julia were too impulsive and naive.


Was Briskvale High their private place, letting in anyone they pleased as if it belonged to them? Such stupidity was hard to stomach.


Sooner or later, Gianna believed,reality would come crashing down on Grace the moment she set foot inside the school.


Schemes for making Grace's life miserable were already swirling in her mind.


"I believe I can handle it," Grace replied, a hint of calm resting on her face.


Rodger's eyes softened further as he retrieved a slim black card from his pocket. "Here, Grace. There's no limit on this card. Get yourself whatever you need."


The whole room seemed to pause, the air growing thick with shock.


All eyes settled on Rodger and Grace.


That card wasn't just a credit card-it was a black card,a symbol of privilege so rare that only a handful existed in the entire world. In the city, maybe two or three people possessed one.
Was Rodger truly thinking straight? Gianna nearly shattered her fork in disbelief, her anger boiling just beneath the surface.



To hand over such a symbol of status to a newly adopted girl felt unfathomable.


Dropping her gaze, Grace let her lashes flicker as she studied the card.


She recognized it immediately. A nearly identical one sat quietly at her purse.


Yet something in Rodger's expression made her accept it wvithout hesitation, her slender fingers curling around the card.


"Thank you, Dad." Her voice was soft, and she traced the edge of the card with delicate care.


Gianna watched, her jaw clenched tight, believing Grace was putting on a show.


Rodger, his face now softened with rare warmth,added quietly, "Let me know if you need anything else."


After a moment, he added, "Tomorrow, why don't you head out and pick up some new clothes?"


With a small nod, Grace slipped the card into her bag.


Across the table, Gianna glared at that simple bag,her
jealousy burning so hot she could hardly sit still.
###Chapter 6 First Encounter


Once dinner ended, Rodger and Julia began gathering their things, ready to bring Grace home to their villa.


Staying at the family estate was a rare occurrence for them-reserved only for family events and major celebrations.



Just as they were about to leave, Ethel summoned the pair into a private room.


Seated regally in her chair, Ethel tapped her cane lightly against the polished floor. "I won't stand in the way of your decision to adopt her, but you should know something," she said, her voice lowering to a conspiratorial hush. "Kids from orphanages have a reputation for sticky fingers. Keep a close eye on your valuables."



Arguing would get her nowhere, and she knew it. For years,she'd watched Rodger and Julia shower Gianna with affection and had been pleased.


Their sudden decision to adopt, especially a girl with no family and a past full of shadows, felt like a blow to the chest.


A frown appeared on Rodger's face as he replied, his
tone firm, "Mom, Grace is my daughter now. I will not tolerate talk like that ever again."


Julia, who was usually soft-spoken, surprised even herself with her sharp response. Her eyes flashed as she said, "Ethel, you mustn't say things that would wound Grace. That child has done nothing wrong."


Seeing Julia ready to defend Grace so fiercely made Ethel's temples throb. She pressed her hand to her forehead and waved them away. "That's enough. You should leave.My head aches, and I need some peace."


After leaving Ethel's room, Julia let out a puzzled sigh."Have you noticed your mom always seems to come down with a headache the moment we're together?Maybe she needs a doctor to check her over?"


Rodger couldn't help but laugh, gently squeezing her hand in his.



Knowing Julia's gentle nature, he could tell her question wasn't meant to be overheard by Ethel.


"Headaches are normal at her age," he said with a warm smile,leading Julia outside.


Grace waited for them on the roadside.



Raindrops from earlier in the evening left puddles scattered along the sidewalk, and Grace stepped around them, her shoes never touching the water.
Out of nowhere, an engine's roar filled the air.


A black Rolls-Royce Phantom tore down the street,flinging muddy water high as it passed.


lcy droplets threatened to drench her, but Grace slipped back just in time, letting the water crash harmlessly at her feet.



A sudden screech shattered the night as the luxury sedan jerked to a halt nearby.


Jumping out, the driver rushed over, nerves on edge,sweat glistening at his temples. "Please forgive me,miss. I was distracted. I didn't mean to-"


Sweeping invisible specks from her dress, Grace replied, "No harm done. Make sure you pay attention in the future."



Though her words were measured, there was a firmness to her tone that couldn't be missed.


Surprise flickered across the driver's face-he hadn't expected such confidence from someone so unassuming.


Without warning, the rear window crept downward with a quiet hum.


A deep male voice sliced through the silence. "Care to
explain what's happening?"


Raising her eyes, Grace found herself staring at a man whose looks would draw any gaze.


Shadows from inside the vehicle hid most of his angular features, though his sharp nose and thin,unyielding lips were impossible to miss.


His eyes held a glint that felt like cold steel pressed against her skin.


That first glance could chill anyone to the bone. Upon a second glance, Grace's pupils slightly contracted as she realized he carried a rare poison within him.


"Mr. Pearson, it's my fault. I was careless-" the driver blurted out, nerves making his words tremble.


Unfazed, the man's elegant hand moved slightly, the cold glint of a Patek Philippe catching the last of the light.


He fixed Grace with a knowing smirk. "Apologies, miss.Tell me how much you want-I'm in a hurry."


He was desperate to track down thelegendary healer,Dr. Q, before it was too late.


Irritation flared in Grace, and she let out a bitter laugh.She tilted an eyebrow and surveyed him from head to toe her mouth curling into a wry grin. "What's the
rush? Afraid you're running out of time on this earth?"she replied, her tone lazy and taunting.


"Don't worry. The poison will hold off for another six months. If you fail to cure it by then..." She let her words hang, then continued, "No doctor in the world will be able to help you."


Colton Pearson, still inside the car, stiffened. His grip on the checkbook tightened, turning his knuckles white."Come again? What did you just say?"


Did she know something?


"Ah, I almost forgot." Grace's eyes drifted down his legs as if something clicked in her mind. "You're dealing with both leg problems and sleepless nights."


She turned to walk away, but paused long enough to say, "It'd be wise for you to save your money.You'll need it for your recovery."


Grace had no intention of feeding his inflated ego.


"We're leaving now, Grace." Rodger's voice, gentle as always,called from afar.

At once, her mocking expression melted into a bright,genuine smile. She dashed towards Rodger and Julia without hesitation.

Off to the side, the driver could only stare, still rattled
by what he'd witnessed.


That girl had sharp eyes! Everything she had said seemed to cut Colton to the core-his poisoning,his paralysis, the restless nights-details scarcely whispered about, even in his own family.


Anyone else brave enough to speak to Colton in that manner had already vanished from this world.


With his gaze never leaving her, Colton watched Grace vanish into the night.


Only after a lengthy silence did he turn away, his voice as chilly as a winter wind. "Let's go."


The Rolls-Royce surged forward, tires humming along the road.


Sitting inside, Colton studied his lifeless legs,absentmindedly tapping his fingers on the polished seat.


"I want to know who she is," he said, his tone unwavering and sharp.


Who exactly was that girl? How could a stranger pick apart all his ailments so easily? Was there a leak about his medical condition? Or did she possess real skill as a healer?


Questions clouded his eyes, making his expression
hard to decipher.



His visit today was only because Dr. Q's presence in the area had reached his ears, so he came in search.Instead,he had stumbled upon a girl who was anything but ordinary.



"Right away, sir," his assistant replied from up front,his tone marked with respect.
###Chapter 7 A Generous
Client



Grace walked alongside her adoptive parents, heading towards her new home together.


The moment they stepped inside, her attention was locked on the sight in front of her.


Inside, the house radiated a refined charm-luxury woven through every detail, but not at the expense of comfort.


Her eyes wandered through the living room,where every relaxed accent or decoration turned out to be an irreplaceable treasure.



Without letting go,Julia took Grace's hand and guided her up the staircase.


Stopping at a polished door, Julia opened it with a hopeful smile and a hint of nerves. "This is your room,Grace. I decorated it according to what I thought was best, since I wasn't sure what you'd like. If anything feels off, just tell me and I'll have it changed right away."



Scanning the room, Grace noticed soothing beige walls, sunlight drifting in, and a gentle warmth filling
every corner. Warmth crept into her chest,blooming softly and steadily.


She said softly, her voice quiet but sincere, "There's nothing I would change. It's exactly right."


Delight spread across Julia's face, lighting up her eyes."You see? I knew we'd get along. I never dreamed I'd have a daughter who shared my sense of style!"


For Julia, the feeling was nothing short of miraculous.It seemed as if fate had woven them together with invisible thread.



Happiness bubbled up in her as she squeezed Grace's shoulder. "Just knowing that I have a daughter now fills me with so much joy."


A surprised look flashed across Grace's features before a genuine, shy smile appeared.


When Julia reached the doorway,she turned back,her voice kind and thoughtful. "One more thing-your brothers James and Johnny had to leave for something urgent, but they'll be back tomorrow. I know they'll be so happy to meet you."


Grace returned the warmth,her smile peaceful.


Once Julia left, Grace closed the door behind her and sat on the edge of the bed, still soaking in the moment.
Her phone buzzed against her leg, the name "Patrick"popping up.


The moment she answered, Patrick Brown's animated voice burst through. "Grace, I've got fantastic news!The Pearson family is looking for your help. They're offering twenty million just for a single consultation,plus more depending on what you do next. Are you interested?"


Not a second of hesitation showed as she answered,"No."



Now that she'd become part of the Holden family,her main wish was to grow closer to them.


While she appreciated the allure of wealth,tying herself to the Pearson family was asking for trouble of the highest order. She had always preferred to avoid drama whenever possible.


Panic laced Patrick's voice. "Grace, think about it!We're talking about the Pearson family. Twenty million just to look at the patient, and that's before the real money comes in! Don't you want to sleep on it?"



Loungingacross her bed, Grace wound a loose curl around her finger, not a hint of concern in her voice."My answer's the same. Not interested."
Unwilling to drop the subject, Patrick's tone dropped to a coaxing whisper. "Look, the current head of the Pearson family isn't just anybody. The man's got the city in the palm of his hand, but he's on the brink-poisoned by something no one else could treat. Even the so-called 'Master Healer' failed, which is why you're getting this call. They said you could name any price you want if you cure him."


A small pause hung in the air before Grace let out a soft, amused laugh. "Of course Kevin Chadwick couldn't handle it. That guy was the weakest of all my apprentices."


The line went quiet as Patrick tried to process the idea that Grace might be talking about the renowned Master Healer.



Boasting like that would have sounded foolish coming from anyone else. But when Grace said it, it seemed nothing short of the truth.


Grace's voice grew lighter as she chuckled again."Right now, my hands are full. I need time with the Holden family to settle in."


Patrick's shout came through loud and clear. "Grace!This isn't just any client-it's the Pearsons! People wait a lifetime for this kind of break!"


With a lazy stretch, Grace replied, her tone almost
playful. "Well, let them wait. If patience isn't part of the deal, then they're not serious about getting better."


Once the call ended, Grace let herself fall back on the bed,eyes wandering to the ceiling as her mind drifted.


Images of that man she'd met earlier flashed through her thoughts-a proud figure.


While stories of the head of the Pearson family had reached her ears, their paths had never crossed before.


Colton Pearson's reputation for ruthless business dealings was matched only by his good looks, making him the subject of endless fascination among the city's elite.


Too bad his story always ended with the same rumor -he was running out of timne.


With a faint shrug, Grace rolled over and mumbled,"That's not my problem."



Fate, however, seemed to have a different idea in store.
###Chapter 8 Her Two Brothers


By the time morning arrived, sunlight poured into the villa, painting the walls in golden streaks.


Rodger had spent the early hours making sure Grace's spot at Briskvale High was secured.


Despite the term already being well underway, his focus remained on helping Grace find her footing as swiftly as possible.


Even with her academic history making college look like a long shot, he insisted she join Briskvale High.


His reasoning was simple-having Gianna and Johnny there meant Grace would never be alone.


After straightening her collar, Grace made her way toward the living room at an easy pace, spotting two tall figures turned away from her.


Soft light spilled over their frames. One stood with military-like poise, while the other leaned into a more laid-back stance.


A cheerful wave from Julia drew her attention. "Come here, Grace!" she called out, her voice full of warmth."Your brothers are home. Let me introduce you."
A quick pause let Grace gather her composure before she approached, flashing a cheerful smile.


Turning first, the older brother towered above her,eyes sharp with intelligence and a hint of mystery curving his lips. Calm radiated from every inch of him.


Almost at the same moment, the younger brother turned around, his hair tousled and hoodie slightly askew. He slouched casually, hands deep in his pockets, an irreverent spark dancing in his eyes as he tossed her a crooked grin.


If the older brother exuded quiet authority, the younger overflowed with restless energy.


Julia beamed with pride as she made the introductions."These are your brothers: James is the eldest, and Johnny is the second. Now our family is complete."


James gave a graceful nod, his voice deep and warm."We're glad you're here."


A slow smirk tugged at Johnny's lips as he gave her a lingering once-over. "So, you're our new little sister?"


Grace responded with a gentle nod, her tone delicate,"James, Johnny, nice to meet you two."


Her lashes swept down, lending her a gentle and quiet air.
Johnny's gaze swept over her again, a teasing spark in his expression.



"So, you're heading to Briskvale High?" he asked,a hint of challenge in his question.



Lifting her chin, Grace met his look and answered quietly, "That's right."


"Well, isn't that convenient." Johnny let a slow smirk creep across his lips. "Gianna and I are both in the Senior A. Any idea where you'll be placed?"


She replied with total honesty, "They haven't told me yet."


Johnny let out a slow "Oh," tilting his head."Not just anybody gets into Briskvale High, you know. Try not to lag behind."


Julia shot her son a disapproving look. "Honestly,Johnny. Is that any way to talk to your sister? You're asking for trouble with that attitude."


Sometimes, he truly made her want to pull her hair out.



With a half-hearted shrug,Johnny let the matter drop,well aware that provoking Julia never ended well.Rodger's devotion to Julia meant Johnny risked more than a scolding if he kept pushing.
Still, the flicker of disdain in his eyes didn't go unnoticed. Grace pressed her lips together and chose not to respond.


James shot his brother a cool, warning glance before turning to Grace. "If you ever need anything, don't hesitate to ask me."



"Thank you, James," she replied obediently.


Without another word, Johnny huffed and headed upstairs. "I'm heading upstairs for a nap."


Julia could only sigh and gave Grace a reassuring pat."Don't mind him. Johnny has his moments,but he'll come around. If he ever gives you trouble, you let me know and I'll set him straight."


A soft laugh escaped Grace as she shook her head."No worries. I'm fine."



Her eyes lingered on Johnny's back as he disappeared upstairs, a spark of resolve glinting within them.


Clearly,he wasn't ready to accept her just yet.


Still, she knew how to handle people like him.


James,however,seemed far easier to approach.


With so much uncertainty, Grace sensed that life here would be anything but dull.
Luckily, she had the weekend to settle in before school began the next day.


Settling into her chair, her mind drifted to the encrypted message Patrick had sent earlier-news about a rare foxglove.



The formula she'd been perfecting absolutely depended on a compound only the rare foxglove could provide.


Her fingers danced across the keyboard, and soon her computer's screen glowed to life. She wasted no time logging into her secure email and clicking open Patrick's latest tip.


The message read, "The rare foxglove located-shop No. 17, underground market. Only a handful are aware.Seller's wary. Move quickly if you want it."


A glint of satisfaction flashed in her eyes, her lips curving into a sly smile. Clearly, this errand would need her personal touch.



She slipped into casual clothes-something understated but tidy-and readied herself to head out.


Downstairs, the sight of Julia arranging fresh blooms greeted her.


"Mom, I'll be out for a while. Promise I'll be home
before dinner," Grace remarked, her tone light,her smile reassuring.


Julia put aside her flowers right away, her voice tinged with concern. "Where are you off to? Would you like a driver to go with you?"


Waving her phone, Grace shook her head."No worries.I'll catch a cab-I know the address by heart."


After a moment, Julia nodded, launching into a string of reminders. "Watch out for strangers, and call me if you need help. If you see anything you like, just buy it -money's not a problem here..."


Grace offered a patient nod. "Understood. I'll be careful."


Even as she stepped onto the front door, Julia's voice followed after her, warm with care."Come home early and take care of yourself!"


That gentle concern lingered,warming Grace from the inside out.


For once, the feeling of being looked after felt genuinely comforting.


After hopping into a cab, she headed straight for the renowned underground market.
###Chapter 9 Highest Offer Gets The Goods



Beneath the city, the underground market sprawled like a tangled ant colony, every tunnel thick with the scent of damp stone, rusted metal, bitter herbs, and the faintest trace of something metallic and bloody.


Down here, the boundaries of legality blurred-contraband herbs exchanged hands, ancient manuscripts changed owners, and shadowy services operated just out of sight.


Whatever had vanished from the surface world could still be found below, provided one's wallet was heavy enough.


At the threshold, Grace pulled a black baseball cap from her bag, tucking her hair beneath it and lowering the brim until herfeatures all but disappeared.


She slipped her hands into her pockets and ambled forward, blending into the crowd with the casual air of someone out for a weekend stroll.


More than a few curious eyes followed her-lone young women rarely wandered into these depths.


Nearby, a group of rough-looking men broke off their
bargaining to ogle her, surprise flickering in their expressions before one offered a slow, predatory grin.


"Did you take a wrong turn, young lady?" asked the biggest of them, stepping into her path, menace in his voice.



Not even pausing,Grace lifted her chin just enough for her icy stare to flash from beneath the brim,and the brute stumbled back, unsettled.


Turning away from their gawking, Grace slipped through the warren of alleys with practiced confidence, soon arriving at a stall marked by a tarnished bronze plaque bearing the number 17.


Instead of a standard door, an animal hide hung in the entry, etched with cryptic runes.


Grace brushed the hide aside and stepped into the fragrant interior, the air inside thick with herbs.


Her words were cool and direct as she addressed the shopkeeper, saying, "I'm here for the real thing-the best you've got."


Nobody in the underground market cared about the story behind the merchandise or haggled over price;only one thing mattered-getting their hands on the finest available.


A rough chuckle echoed from the shadows behind the
counter."And who might you be?"


Stepping forward, a burly middle-aged man with hard features revealed himself.


He peered at the figure before him, his scowl deepening when he realized it was just a girl in a baseball cap.


Grace's attempt to hide her identity wasn't fooling anyone; her slim frame and smooth, youthful jaw gave her away.


He took in her plain white T-shirt, faded jeans, and the absence of anything resembling a designer bag. The verdict was immediate-a broke student.


With a dismissive wave, he tried to usher her out. "Go on, run along! This isn't a playground for kids.Everything here costs millions. You probably don't even have lunch money, do you?"


He couldn't fathom where she found the nerve to even walk in. Intent on ignoring her, he turned toward the storeroom, but a gentle laugh froze him in place.


Grace stood calmly, producing a sleek black card from her pocket and letting it rest, almost carelessly, on the counter.


"Do you have money on this card?" Skepticism clouded the shopkeeper's face as he picked up the
card, swiping it through the reader-only to have his eyes widen at the staggering balance staring back at him.



Instantly, his attitude flipped. With a greedy smile and hurried,deferential gestures, he replied, "Miss, please forgive my rudeness! Five million for the foxglove. I'll have it for you right away-"


Suddenly, chaos erupted near the entrance,interrupting the negotiation.


The shopkeeper's head jerked up, and his expression shifted instantly as he rushed to the door,bowing low."Mr.Byrd! What an honor to have you stop by."


Dominick Byrd strode in, his tailored suit and commanding presence leaving no doubt about his status. "I heard you're holding a rare foxglove. Mr.Pearson wants it."



Nervousness prickled at the shopkeeper's skin, sweat glistening as he forced a smile. "You're always up to date! I do have the item, but the price is-"


Dominick cut him off with a cold sneer, tossing a check across the counter. "Eight million. Wrap it up.Now."



The shopkeeper's head nodded eagerly. "Of course,sir! Right away-" But before he could move, fingers clamped around his wrist with surprising strength.
He spun around, only to meet the cold fire in Grace's eyes.



"I was here first." The words weren't shouted, but the edge in her voice made them cut deep.


A faint line appeared between her brows, and the air grew noticeably colder, tension rippling out from where she stood.



"We have one rule here-highest offer gets the goods,"the shopkeeper snapped, his voice dripping with contempt.


All he saw was a reckless young woman, no match for real power.



Certainly, he would say no to eight million.


Without hesitation, Grace's voice rang out, calm and unyielding."Ten million."


Dominick's voice was firm and unyielding. "Fifteen million."



Grace's eyes flashed with cold resolve. "Twenty million," she answered, not missing a beat.


A stunned silence fell over the shopkeeper as his jaw nearly hit the floor.


On the top floor, the scene in the exclusive VIP suite
was entirely different. Colton reclined on a sleek leather sofa, fingers drumming idly on the armrest,his every gesture dripping with unspoken authority.


Dominick's update was brisk. "Sir, she's just offered twenty million."


Colton's lips curled slightly, his reply low and commanding, saying, "Raise it again."


Downstairs, the shopkeeper leaned in and whispered urgently, "Young lady, you're treading on dangerous ground.The man backing him isn't someone ordinary people can afford to cross."



Just the thought of the Pearson family's shadow looming over the city made the shopkeeper shudder.



A slow, mocking grin spread across Grace's lips,her eyes glittering with defiance. "Do I look like someone easily intimidated?"



The ferocity radiating from her sent the shopkeeper stumbling backward, fear quickening his pulse. Who was this girl, really? This could only end badly. The realization struck him with a jolt-he was caught between two powers he couldn't afford to anger.
###Chapter 10 A Good Fight



Grace fixed the shopkeeper with an unflinching stare,her fingers drumming a rhythmic, deliberate beat on the counter.



A bead of sweat traced down the man's face as he ventureda worriedglance towardDominick."Mr.Byrd..."


The promise of fortune that came with the foxglove,had completely evaporated. At this rate, survival seemed like the best outcome he could hope for.Nothing in his years running the stall had left him in such a bind.



Dominick regarded Grace with cool detachment."Not everything in this world can be bought. If Mr. Pearson wants something,he gets it-simple as that."


Unmoved, Grace let a cold smirk tug at her lips. "Is that so? Then let's put that to the test."


With a smooth motion, she lifted her hand and idly tapped her black card against the surface. "Thirty million," she said,voice steady.


That was the absolute ceiling she'd set for herself. If she hadn't encountered this annoying man, she wouldn't have had to inflate a five-million purchase to
thirty million. This was madness, pure and simple.


She wasn't bluffing-if the bidding climbed higher,she was ready to settle things a different way.


A flicker of curiosity sparked within her. She genuinely wondered what sort of fool with too much money was behind this man.


For a moment, silence swept through the shop.The shopkeeper's legs gave out and he nearly collapsed,barely holding himself upright.


A look of disbelief swept over Dominick's face-Grace's resolve had caught him completely off guard.


Meanwhile, up in the private suite, Colton's lazy sprawl paused, the spark of intrigue glinting in his gaze.


"She's taken it up to thirty million," Dominick said through the earpiece, edged with uncertainty.


Colton's reply was smooth, a shade more interested than before. "Fascinating. Find out who she is."


He'd had his eye on the rare foxglove, hoping it might ease his condition.


Despite the tales of its near-miraculous detoxifying powers,he suspected the plant was more a balm for the mind than a true cure.
Judging by the woman's persistence, it clearly meant a great deal to her.


Lost in thought, Colton let his eyes fall, then an amused chuckle slipped from his lips. "Let her win it."


Dominick hesitated, concern creeping into his voice."But sir-"



"It's irrelevant. It'd only go to waste with me," Colton replied, a note of dry humor in his tone.


The truth was stark: without Dr. Q's intervention, he doubted he'd see another season change.



Lately, his health had been in steady decline.



Rising from the sofa, Colton called to his men. "We're leaving."


Grace grew impatient at the silence and rapped her knuckles against the counter, fixing the shopkeeper with a glare. "Well? Are you in business or not?"


The shopkeeper, ashen and shaking, darted a nervous glance toward Dominick for direction.


Powerless to influence the outcome, he could only react as the scene unfolded.



Through his earpiece, Dominick absorbed Colton's decision, and his features twisted with frustration.
Grinding out the words, he finally said, "I'm out. She can have it."


A flicker of surprise crossed Grace's face at the sudden capitulation.


Without missing a beat, she slid her card across the reader, pocketed the foxglove, and strode briskly out of the shop.


No sooner had Grace left the shadows of the underground market than a handful of street thugs materialized, circling her with predatory grins.


Rumors didn't stay buried long in these tunnels.Word had already spread-someone just dropped tens of millions on a foxglove, and that someone was now a target.


One of the men suggested, "Hey there, gorgeous, it's getting late. Want a ride home?"


Another chimed in, "Forget home-let's hit a bar. You look like you need to have some fun."


A third added, "Or maybe you'd rather take a spin with me instead?"



Grace blinked, her eyes darkening to cold steel.Looked like a few idiots had volunteered themselves for a lesson.
A good fight was long overdue-she relished the opportunity to stretch her limbs.


"If you're smart, you'll walk away right now," she warned, eyes flashing with cold intent, her voice low and unwavering.


Mocking laughter echoed back at her as the men exchanged grins.


"Did you hear that? She's telling us to scram!"


"This one's got spirit-l like that," another jeered,undeterred.



The sight of Grace's smooth skin and elegant frame only fueled their twisted desires.


Clearly, these men intended more than a simple mugging.


A cold smirk tugged at the corner of Grace's mouth."Apparently, you boys don't understand a direct warning."



Despite the almost playful tone, there was a razor's edge in her gaze.


Swaggering forward, the ringleader reached for her cheek. "You're a wildcat, huh? That just makes you-"



His taunt was cut short as Grace snatched his wrist,
spun, and hurled him over her shoulder with ruthless efficiency.


A sharp yelp escaped him as he crashed to the pavement, instantly curled into a heap of agony.


Not waiting for shock to wear off, Grace slipped between the others like a shadow, her movements swift,precise,and merciless.



Her next target caught a spinning kick square in the chest, and the force sent him tumbling ten feet back.


"Get her, now! I'll make sure she regrets this," shouted one of the thugs, flashing a knife as he lunged.


Without a flicker of fear, Grace's eyes narrowed to cold slits. As the blade darted toward her,she twisted aside, delivering a sharp chop to his wvrist.


The weapon clattered across the pavement, followed immediately by her brutal elbow slamming into his ribs -he dropped to his knees, coughing blood.


It took less than a minute for the entire gang to hit the ground, writhing and groaning in defeat.


Grace brushed her hands together, as if ridding them of crumbs, and shot the fallen men a glare colder than midnight. "Have you learned your lesson-or do you need more encouragement?"
Fear took over their bluster; they stammered apologies, all pretense gone. "We're sorry-we had no idea you were this tough. Please, we won't cross you again!"



Her gaze lingered on their ashen, trembling faces."Move along. Now."


After a quick adjustment of her clothes, she stood taller, her confidence radiating like a force field.


"Run! Move it!" The battered men scrambled to their feet and took off, stumbling over each other in their haste to disappear.


Meanwhile, Colton-watching the entire exchange from a distance-was left speechless, recognition dawning as he realized just who she was.
###Chapter 11 Blatant Double Standards



Colten's long fingers tapped rhythmically against the car window, an icy tension radiating from him.


"Sir, is something the matter?" Dominick asked from the front passenger seat, picking up on the shift in atmosphere and quickly glancing back.


Colten's eyes were calm but blank. "Any updates on that investigation I assigned you?"


A pulse of unease shot through Dominick. Beads of sweat formed along his brow. "I'm still digging, but it's odd..."



He paused, then forced himself to continue, "The security footage from that spot looks like it was deliberately altered. It's nothing but static now. We haven't been able to recover anything useful."


"Oh?" Colten raised an eyebrow, a sharp look flickering through his eyes.


As he slowly straightened his cufflinks, he said in a low,dangerous voice, "And this happened in a residential zone under constant surveillance?"
Sweat had already soaked through the back of Dominick's shirt.



Colten let out a quiet chuckle just then, his eyes landing on to the spot where Grace had stood outside the window. "Drop the investigation."



Dominick hesitated. "You mean..."



"It was the young lady from earlier." A faint smirk curved Colten's lips. "She's got some impressive reflexes."



"She? The same one who outbid us on the foxglove?"Dominick echoed in disbelief.


He suddenly remembered the moment Grace-slight and elegant-took down a few grown men with startling speed. "Who is she really?"


"Look into her," Colten ordered. Something about her didn't sit right with him.


"Got it." With her face now familiar to Dominick,tracking her down would be a lot simpler.


After securing the rare foxglove, Grace rushed home.


"Grace!" Julia hurried toward her, hands trembling as she grabbed hold of Grace's shoulders. "What took you so long to get home? I was this close to sending
James out to find you."


Grace felt a rush of warmth tinged with guilt. She bit her lower lip softly, blaming the delay on those thugs.She should have kicked a few of them harder.


She quickly masked her thoughts with a bright smile."I'm sorry, Mom. Something came up while I was on my way back."


Johnny lounged lazily against the staircase railing,mischief written all over his striking face. "Mom, she's not a toddler. You're making a fuss over nothing."


He recalled the times he and James disappeared for days without stirring this much concern.


"You just don't get it!" Julia snapped at him, then softened immediately, brushing her fingers through Grace's hair. "Grace is beautiful and kind. There are dangerous people out there..."


Johnny rolled his eyes, the corner of his mouth twitching.He couldn't figure out what kind of magic Grace had worked on their mother.


Still, school would be a different world. One where Julia wouldn't be there to shield her.






At exactly eight the next morning, a sleek black
Maybach pulled up in front of the towering gates of Briskvale High.


Julia gently straightened Grace's already-perfect uniform and adjusted her tie with care. "Don't stress,sweetheart. Your dad already talked to the admissions director. You, Gianna, and Johnny have all been placed in the same class. If something confuses you,just ask them. And if anyone gives you trouble,you call me right away."


Grace nodded, her hair fluttering slightly in the morning breeze. "Got it, Mom. I'll be fine."


"Oh, and one more thing-"'Julia leaned in,lowering her voice. "I tucked some money into the inner pocket of your backpack. Use it on anything you need.Don't ever go without."


"Thanks. I'll give school my best," Grace replied.Honestly, studying felt like the easiest thing in the world to her.



Julia sighed, gently cupping Grace's cheeks. "Your grades don't matter to me. I'm only interested in your happiness."


As she took in Grace's composed figure in her school uniform, her chest tightened unexpectedly. "We've only just started living together, and now you're heading off... I'm already missing you."
Rodger,familiar with Julia's sentimental side, stepped in with a chuckle. "She's only going to school, not disappearing. She'll be back home after class; you'll survive."


"But it's still several hours... What if she doesn't adjust to the new environment? It makes me nervous," Julia murmured,looking worried.


Johnny, seated close by, rolled his eyes. "If we don't head in now, we'll be late. And showing up late on the first day? That's asking for trouble."


Julia glared at him. "Look after your sister at school.Focus on your studies, or your dad will straighten you out."


Johnny's lips twitched in silent protest. Such blatant double standards! Absolutely shameless favoritism!


Julia had just told Grace that grades didn't matter,only happiness did. But when it came to him?Different rules entirely!


Sometimes he really questioned whether he was even Julia's biological son, despite her constant reassurances.


Still, he wasn't foolish enough to talk back,especially with Rodger standing right there. If he annoyed Julia,Rodger, who adored her dearly, wouldn't spare him.
A wise man knew when to stay quiet, so Johnny decided to keep his mouth shut.


Rodger checked the time and gently guided Julia back toward the car. He glanced over his shoulder at Johnny and Grace. "Alright, you two head in."


The two made their way toward the school gates.


Julia stood still, watching Grace disappear into the crowd, a touch of sadness in her eyes. "Do you think she'll be okay? Maybe I should pick her up early."


Rodger placed a hand on her shoulder. "She needs to handle things herself. That's how she'll grow."


And with that, he led her away.
###Chapter 12 Placement Test



At the office, Anthony Baldwin, the dean of Briskvale High, slid his glasses higher, eyes narrowed as he scanned the file in front of him.


Grace's academic file told a familiar story-three transfers and unimpressive marks across the board.


Still, the admissions director's reminder echoed in his mind. Rodger Holden had contributed an entire building to the school. That kind of generosity made many things easier to overlook.


Using the desk phone, Anthony called out, "Ms. Dixon,could you stop by my office for a moment?"


It didn't take long for the door to swing open.


Ellie Dixon entered, her dark-rimmed glasses perched high and her chin held higher. "Mr. Baldwin, is this really so urgent? My honors students are in the middle of a major group project."


She had a history of sending students to the top of the SAT rankings, and she knew it.


A string of successes had built her reputation, and she wore it like a badge.
Trying to maintain a neutral tone, Anthony met her gaze. "There'll be a new face in your classroom today -Grace Miller." ①


"Excuse me? You mean a transfer?" Ellie's skeptical gaze flicked toward Grace, who waited silently by the wall.


Grace lowered her gaze,long bangs falling forward to shield her features, an unmistakable awkwardness hanging around her.


Without much hesitation, Ellie decided Grace fit the profile of a struggling student-she had seen plenty who never managed to improve.


"You can't be serious, Mr. Baldwin! The semester's well underway, and you're telling me we have a new transfer?" Ellie's voice rang out.


It was understandable that the protest was so sharp-transfers were unheard of at Briskvale High, a school famous for its strict policies.



Anthony let out a weary sigh. "These are her academic records. Does this look like a joke to you?"



Without another word, Ellie flipped through the papers, and a wave of disbelief left her momentarily unsteady.
"Not a single mark for Math, English, or Science?"Ellie's voice sliced through the air, her hand trembling as she jabbed at the transcript. "You're telling me she failed every core subject? Why would you even consider putting her in the honors class?"



The mood in the room shifted, tension thickening the air.



Anthony cleared his throat, keeping his voice low and careful. "Ms. Dixon, perhaps you could be a bit more considerate..."



It didn't help that Grace stood right there-his words did little to soften the blow.



Snapping the folder closed, Ellie glared at him,her eyes hard behind her glasses. "This is the top class in the school, Mr. Baldwin! Every student here has lvy League dreams. How is she supposed to keep up with them?"



Grace stayed quiet, head lowered and lashes casting faint shadows across her cheeks, the picture of shy resignation.



No one noticed the hint of a smirk that flickered and vanished on her lips.


"Ms. Dixon, that's enough." Anthony's voice grew firm as he pulled out a sealed document and slid it across
the desk. "The school board has already decided."


A single glance at the paper, with the principal's bold seal,drained all color from Ellie's face.


She wasn't ready to give in just yet. "Even top-tier teachers struggle with students who have this record.At least let her prove herself with a placement test."


Without waiting for an answer, Ellie snatched up a science test paper from the desk.


"Here-see what you can do with this." She hoped the difficulty would discourage Grace from staying.


Ellie would rather see the girl bow out now than face certain embarrassment in front of the entire class.


Anthony hesitated, then finally gave a resigned nod."Grace Miller,take a seat and begin when you're ready."He knew the exam was notoriously tough.


Science had always been Ellie's specialty-she'd chosen the hardest paper for this little test.


Settling into a chair, Grace picked up her pen and started the exam.


From her spot nearby, Ellie watched closely,ready to witness Grace stumble and embarrass herself.


Keeping her head down, Grace moved her pen across
the page, her hand flying as if the questions were routine.


Ellie stood nearby, arms folded and a smirk on her face, certain the test would overwhelm even her brightest students.


To everyone's shock, Grace rose from her seat in under fifteen minutes. "I'm done."


Anthony and Ellie stared at her in disbelief. That was impossibly fast.


Anthony felt a quiet sigh form inside him. Maybe her troubles weren't just poor grades-maybe she truly lacked focus. A trace of disappointment crept over him.


Ellie let out a mocking laugh. Speed meant nothing if the answers were nonsense. Clearly, Grace had just filled the sheet to look impressive.


Even so, Ellie snatched up the test and gave it a quick scan,blinking in surprise.



Every question had an answer. Her skepticism only deepened. Surely, Grace didn't believe that simply answering everything would make her stand out.


Grabbing her pen, Ellie began marking, the pen's scratch filling the silence.


However, as the answer key matched up line after line,
Ellie's face darkened-Grace hadn't missed a single question.


Finishing up, Ellie's voice went cold. "She completed this science exam in under fifteen minutes. Every answer is correct."



Anthony stood rooted to the spot,completely floored.Could Grace actually be gifted? He'd never witnessed anyone breeze through a placement test without a single mistake.


With a bitter edge, Ellie said with a scoff, "It's hard to believe, Mr. Baldwin. Such hard questions done this fast? Forget her transcript, this is clearly a case of cheating. I won't sit back and welcome a student who plays us for fools."
###Chapter 13 Her New Class


A look of disbelief washed over Anthony. "We all saw Grace Miller work through the test ourselves. That should rule out any idea of cheating, don't you think?"


Despite his words, uncertainty tugged at the back of his mind. It was hard to ignore-finishing such a challenging test so quickly seemed almost impossible.


"Mr. Baldwin, what if she already knew the questions?Anyone could have told her about the questions beforehand. It's hardly a state secret. Either way, we can't let someone with questionable behavior join the honors class," Ellie said, making her disapproval plain.


An awkward tension settled over the room. Anthony found himself stuck, reluctant to let Grace affect the honors class's reputation, but aware this placement had come from above.



With Ellie holding her ground, Anthony turned toward Grace for guidance. "Grace Miller, perhaps the honors class isn't the right fit for you..."


Grace gave him a steady look and answered without a hint of worry, "That's fine with me."



Relief broke across Anthony's face, and he wasted no
time in calling for three more teachers to join them.


With an encouraging tone, he introduced her."Everyone, this is Grace Miller. She'll be joining a senior class starting today."


Ellie didn't wait for him to finish. She shot a glare at Grace's way. "She's the prodigy who managed to ace a science exam in just fifteen minutes."



Standing off to one side, Grace kept her head bowed,her expression hidden from view.


The subtle meaning in Ellie's words was not lost on the other teachers. Their gazes flickered to Grace,full of silent questions.


Nobody said anything for a moment.


"We're glad to have you, Grace." Finally, Fred Anderson broke the silence. He was easily the oldest teacher there, approaching fifty, and had spent most of his life working at this school.


Lately, though, the students seemed less and less interested in his classes.



Turning his attention back to Grace, Anthony asked quietly, "Are you absolutely sure this arrangement works for you, Grace Miller?"



He was mindful of her family's generous donation and
the original promise of a spot in the honors class.


"Yes, I'm fine with the arrangement," Grace replied calmly.


A weight seemed to lift from Anthony's shoulders."Perfect. Mr. Anderson, would you show her to her new class?"


Without much delay, Fred guided Grace down the corridor.


Age had slowed his steps, so Grace matched his measured pace with quiet respect.


While they walked, Fred took in her appearance-a neatly pressed uniform and an air of quiet discipline.


He had been interrupted mid-lesson, and the sound of his students' laughter and chatter echoed down the hall.


When Fred entered the classroom with Grace, the students' rowdiness faded to a hush.



Turning to address the class, Fred announced,"Class,this is Grace Miller. She'll be joining us from today."


Instantly,the room filled with murmurs.



"She's really pretty, isn't she?"
"Word is, her grades were awful, and her family bought her a spot here. No way she'd getin otherwise."


"Another spoiled rich kid, I bet."


"Isn't she from the Holden family?"


Grace offered her introduction, voice steady. "Hello,I'm Grace Miller."


Her hair, drawn back in a ponytail, added a laid-back energy. The slight curve of her lips hinted at a smile,but her gaze remained unreadable.


Her skin was flawless, smooth as porcelain.



"She's gorgeous!"



"She could easily outshine the prom queen."


"We might have a new queen now."


Scanning the classroom, Fred gave a nod. "Grace,there's a seat open next to Adrianna. You can sit there."


Fred's gesture guided Grace toward a seat near Adrianna Walsh-a girl with neat braids and a gentle smile, though a small dark mark marred her otherwise cheerful face.



Without hesitation, Grace walked across the room.
Out of nowhere, a boy tried to trip her by sticking out his foot.


However, a sharp crack filled the air, and his face went sheet-white as he grabbed his foot, crying out,"Ouch! My foot!"


With a wide-eyed innocence, Grace looked at him."Did you hurt yourself?"


Leaning closer, she pretended to help him up,her voice barely a whisper as she murmured, "Try that again, and next time it'll be worse."


Fear flickered in his eyes. He looked up at her as though he had glimpsed something chilling.


Fred rushed over, concern etched on his face. "Bruce,are you alright?"


Shrinking into his seat, Bruce Douglas stammered, "It's nothing..." Too mortified to confess, he avoided everyone's eyes.


Calmly, Grace took her place by Adrianna and pulled a textbook from her backpack.


With a shy motion, Adrianna slid a folded note onto Grace's desk. Inside, the words warned, "Watch out for Bruce. He's a bully."
One glance at the message brought a small smile to Grace's lips.


She picked up her pen and responded, "Thanks for the heads up."



The next line she wrote suddenly turned sharp. "It's hard to tell who should be worried."



Suddenly, the back door slammed open with a noisy thud.



A tall boy strode in, blazer slung carelessly over his shoulder and a mischievous grin already in place. "Fred,what's up?"


A deep frown creased Fred's brow. "Charles Pearson,this is getting old. You're late again."


Conversation in the classroom faded instantly.


Lifting her gaze, Grace found herself locking eyes with Charles-there was something familiar and piercing about his stare.



"This is Grace Miller, your new classmate," Fred introduced. "Since you're the class president, I'd like you to help her out."


With a slow arch of his brow, Charles Pearson studied Grace before flashing an easy smile. "Happy to help.
Just say the word."
###Chapter 14 Outshining Gianna



Throughout the remainder of the lesson, an unusual hush settled over the classroom as eyes kept drifting toward the window-side desk.



Grace,propping her chin with one hand, seemed lost in thought, her attention fixed outside, completely unfazed by the surreptitious stares darting her way.


As soon as the dismissal bell chimed, students clustered around, vying for a better look ather.


"That must be the new girl,right?"


"Wow, I think she might even outshine Gianna White!"



"Hey,lower your voice..."



At the same time, Gianna sat absorbed in her reading,apparently untouched by the buzz.


With her striking looks, she'd long been the campus darling,crowned prom queen of Briskvale High and holding a key position in the student union-her popularity practically legendary.


The quiet was broken by Lizzie Watson bursting
through the door, taking the seat directly in front of Gianna. "Gianna, have you heard? Everyone's talking about Grace Miller-the transfer! They're saying she's even prettier than you!"



Gianna's hand froze on her page for just a second.Rodger had succeeded in pulling strings to get Grace enrolled here. Relief flickered through her-at least Grace hadn't landed in her class. Still, for someone who'd always worn the crown, the prospect of Grace outshining her was a bitter pill to swallow.There was no way she'd stand by and let Grace get ahead of herself.



Pressing her lips together, she spoke in a gentle,almost patronizing tone. "Lizzie, don't take it so hard.The transfer student everyone's talking about? She's actually my Uncle Rodger's adopted daughter. Her childhood was rough-she bounced between foster homes and orphanages. She's no academic standout either. My uncle pulled every string to get her into here. Now that she's here, we ought to be welcoming."



Inside, she could barely contain the flare of resentment heating her thoughts.



"You're just too nice, Gianna," Lizzie replied, rolling her eyes in disbelief. "I went to see her myself-she's nothing special. Those rumors are way overblown.She only made it here because of connections. Bet she won't last long."
Meanwhile, Colton stepped from the bathroom,steam trailing behind and a towel thrown loosely over his shoulders, damp hair dripping down his back.


He found Dominick standing ready, the dutiful assistant as always.


"I've done some digging, sir," Dominick said. "The girl you wanted information on is Grace Miller. She's just been adopted by the Holden family and spent her early years in an orphanage."


A slight furrow appeared between Colton's brows."That's all you've found? Nothing else of note?"


An unshakable suspicion gnawed at Colton-there had to be more to Grace than met the eye.



"We've only managed surface details so far. Every time we try to push past the basics, the trail just goes cold," Dominick explained, frustration evident in his tone.



Such a scenario was unprecedented for him. With all their resources and expert investigators, they'd barely scratched the surface of Grace's background.



A thin, cold smile played at Colton's lips. "Don't stop -keep digging. Any word on Dr. Q?”
That lead was just as urgent.


Dominick shook his head. "No progress yet. Dr. Q remains impossible to trace."



"Raise the bounty again," Colton instructed,his voice crisp.



"Will do."







At last, the final bell rang, signaling the end of the school day.



Grace quietly packed up her books and slipped out of the classroom.



Julia had reached out, offering her a ride home.



Still,Grace politely refused, knowing the after-school rush would clog the streets, she figured hailing a cab would be much simpler.


Julia finally conceded, offering one last reminder for Grace to be careful before bustling off to whip up dinner.



She wanted nothing more than to spoil her daughter with a delicious home-cooked feast.



Grace hadn't made it far from the gate when her
phone began to buzz.


Patrick's enthusiastic voice came through the line. "I'm right outside your school-just say the word and I'll drive you home!"



Stomach rumbling, Grace didn't hesitate to accept his offer.



From a distance, she easily picked out Patrick's car parked curbside.



A Mercedes this shiny and ostentatious couldn't help but attract curious looks from passing students and parents.



Suppressing a sigh, Grace made her way over, fighting the urge to roll her eyes.


The window slid down at a leisurely pace, and Patrick greeted her with a grin that was far too eager.


"Over here!" he called out, hopping out to swing the passenger door open. "I figured you'd appreciate a VIP pick-up today. How's that for service?"



Grace slipped into the seat, dropping her backpack behind her. With a sideways glance, she lowered her voice. "Trying to announce to the whole school you know me? This car's flashy enough to stop traffic."


Unfazed, Patrick laughed and pulled into traffic. "I'm
just helping you make an entrance! Besides, in this city,cars like this barely turn heads..."


Grace gave him a sidelong look. "Try not to draw so much attention next time."


Patrick raised a hand in mock surrender. "Whatever you say." He shifted gears, then added, "Hey, have you been getting enough sleep? Also, I'm almost out of those pills you gave me."


Those pills were no ordinary supplements-they had a reputation for boosting vitality and extending life.


Supply was notoriously tight. Only a couple ever made it onto the underground market each month.


Demand kept driving up the price, and every batch sparked fierce bidding wars.


Patrick never quite understood the fuss. On the surface, the pills looked unremarkable. Yet everyone seemed desperate to get their hands on them.


He figured it must come down to either the allure of scarcity or the endless games of the wealthy.


Grace, on the other hand, treated the legendary pills as if they were nothing more than candies-she'd casually pop one in her mouth whenever she felt like it.
###Chapter 15 Spreading
Rumors



Grace glanced out the window and said offhandedly,"I'm going to school recently, so I won't have time."


"I just don't get it. Why go back to school? With everything you know, you could be teaching at the best university as a professor," Patrick said.


Grace turned to him, serious now. "Don't you think it would be fun?"



Fun? Not even close. Patrick shook his head. They could be making real money out there, but Grace wasn't interested. What a waste of talent.


"Oh, by the way-someone's been asking around about you. Says it's about some medical issue.What should we do?" Patrick asked. He had connections everywhere,and Grace usually left these things for him to handle.



"Keep blocking them. I'm not interested." Grace just wanted a quiet life now, something that felt warm and normal.



As she got into the car, chatting with Patrick, she didn't notice two girls standing a little distance away,
phones raised, snapping pictures.


Lizzie rubbed her eyes and yanked on Gianna's sleeve."Gianna, Look! Isn't that Grace? Why is she getting into that Mercedes?"



Gianna followed her gaze, stunned to see Grace sitting effortlessly in a luxurious car.



The window was slightly down, and the driver was an attractive young man.


"That's weird. What is she doing in a car like that? But that's not Uncle Rodger's car," Gianna said slowly.



Grace had grown up in an orphanage. Where would she even meet someone that rich? She'd gotten herself a sugar daddy?


What a shame. What would her family say if they knew?


Lizzie's eyes widened, sparkling with scandal. "I've heard of girls like her charm some rich guy and get taken care of. Sell their pride for a fancy life."


Gianna pretended to be shocked. "You think Grace would really do that?"



"What else could it be?" Lizzie said, smirking. "Look at her-smooth skin, perfect hair. She doesn't look like someone who grew up in an orphanage. She looks like one of those rich girls on social media. And that man?
He's no college student."


"Maybe he's just a friend?" Gianna offered.


Lizzie scoffed. "Gianna, you're too innocent. Grace is hiding something. Just wait and see. Something big's going to come out soon. And you should stay away from her."



Gianna gave a slow nod. This was exactly what she'd wanted.


Lizzie was a talker. Give her something juicy, and she'd make sure the whole school heard about it by morning.



Gianna knew rumors would spread on their own.







When Grace opened the door to her house,she was hit with the delicious smell of home-cooked food.



Julia peeked out from the kitchen, her apron slightly stained with sauce. "Grace, go wash up! Dinner's ready -I made it myself today."


Julia loved tending to her plants and experimenting with new dishes in the kitchen.


"Smells amazing," Grace said, taking a deep breath,her usual calm expression softening into a smile that made her look her age.
Not long after, Rodger and Johnny walked in through the door.


James,who was busy withhis internship, only dropped by once in a while now.


As they all sat down to eat, Rodger asked gently,"Grace,how was your day?"


"Smooth," she replied,nodding.


Johnny rolled his eyes and muttered, "I heard someone with terrible grades got kicked out of the honors class for cheating."


"Johnny!" Rodger's voice thundered as he slammed his hand on the table. His usual calm was gone."Watch your mouth."


Johnny raised his hands like he was innocent and pulled out his phone. "I'm just saying what everyone else is saying."


"Dad, it's true I'm no longer in the honors class, but l didn't cheat. I'll prove myself with my next results,"Grace said.



She could have gone to the teachers' office to clear her name, but she didn't want to be seen as a troublemaker.
After all, time had a way of revealing who people really were. The truth always came out in the end.



Another exam was just around the corner. That would be her chance to let her results do the talking.


Julia quickly put her fork down too, concern on her face. "Grace,what happened exactly?"



"Mom, it's nothing serious. Just a little misunderstanding. Honestly, I like my new class,"Grace reassured her.


"If anything happens again, you have to tell us," Julia said firmly. "We're here for you."


"I will." Grace nodded,grateful.


After dinner, she went up to her room,only for her phone to start ringing. It was Adrianna.



They'd only just exchanged numbers after school,so Grace was surprised to see her call. She answered quickly.



"Check the school forum. Someone posted something about you. I know it's all lies, but they're spreading rumors. I just wanted to let you know," Adrianna said,her voice rushed with worry.


They hadn't known each other long, but they'd clicked
right away.


Adrianna could already tell Grace wasn't like the things people said online.



"Thanks. I'll look," Grace said calmly.



She was curious to see exactly what kind of game those students were playing.
###Chapter 16 Ethel's Urgent Summons



Once the call ended, Grace powered up her laptop and navigated straight to the school's online forum.



Rumors had been expected, but the frenzy that greeted her was beyond anything she'd imagined.


A bold new thread-"Truth About The New Transfer,Grace Miller"-immediately drew her focus.


According to the anonymous source, Grace's childhood had been spent bouncing between orphanages andfoster homes until finally, the Holden family adopted her. Worse still, the writer insisted she'd used their connections just to get into Briskvale High. And the cherry on top was the insinuation about a luxurious car-a scandal in the making, apparently.



Her slender fingers moved confidently over the keyboard,blue light glinting off her steady expression.


Accusations came with so-called proof-a photo of Patrick's flashy Mercedes parked by the gate,another of her stepping into the car.


The comments below the post churned with gossip.
"Called it! Girls like that are always hiding something."


"Rumor has it she was passed around foster homes in Stranta and never fit in anywhere..."


"Why would the Holden family bother adopting her?There's got to be more to the story."


A faint smirk tugged at Grace's lips, but a flicker of coldness crept into her eyes.


She clicked through to the poster's profile,but found nothing useful. It was an anonymous account.


"Not even brave enough to use their own name," she murmured,swiftly capturing screenshots as proof.


A soft buzz interrupted her thoughts-Adrianna's message appeared. "Grace, don't let the comments get to you. I'm already reporting the thread!"


Grace replied calmly, "Don't worry. It's not bothering me."



Another message popped up-Patrick this time."I saw the forum mess. Want me to take care of it? I can wipe that thread clean."


Grace casually responded, "Already handled it. The post is gone, and the forum is locked down."


Places that allowed rumors to spread unchecked
hardly deserved to stay open.


Patrick then asked, "Did you track down who started it?"


"Yeah, I traced the IP to a computer in the school library," she replied.


For just one day at school, Grace found it strange how quickly she had become a target.



Blending in had never been an option. Some people just couldn't help but target the ones who stood out.


Thinking the issue settled, Grace set the matter aside.


But shortly afterward, Rodger's entire family received an urgent summons from Ethel.


Julia could only wonder what was going on. Ethel always seemed to end up with a headache when the whole family showed up.


Yet, with Ethel being Rodger's mother, no one dared refuse the invitation.



Grace barely stepped through the door before Ethel's sharp voice cut the air. "Grace, our family's reputation matters to me. I won't have you tarnishing it."


Julia's brow creased. "Ethel, that's really uncalled for.Grace always shows respect, and she would never do anything like that."
Rodger mirrored the concern on her face. "Grace has barely settled in. She's only attended two days at her new school. What could she have possibly done?"


Without warning,Ethel let out a dismissive laugh and brought an iPad crashing down onto the table."Take a look at this yourselves! People all over the city are whispering that we've brought home a girl with a questionable past!"



Across the screen, screenshots flashed-remnants of a deleted post, now being shared everywhere online and through chat groups.


Shock rushed over Julia as she snatched the device."None of this is true! Grace would never get mixed up in something like this. She's a wonderful girl..."


"Wonderful, you say?" Ethel interrupted, her glare cutting straight through Grace. "Wonderful enough to spark a scandal her first week here? And just who is that man in the expensive car?"


Grace opened her mouth, but Gianna jumped in first."Grandma, please don't work yourself up. That person could just be one of Grace's friends."



"Friends, is it? Do you honestly think a girl from the orphanage suddenly knows someone so rich? There are girls out there who chase after money without a second thought," Ethel said, her voice full of warning.
Grace's gaze turned cold, her composure unwavering.


Ethel caught that look and her irritation grew. "Let me make myself clear. Our family's reputation matters above all else. I will not tolerate any improper behavior from you, not while you are part of the family."


"I swear to you all, I have never done anything to tarnish the family name. That man truly is my friend,"Grace said, her voice steady and clear.


Without hesitation, Julia squeezed Grace's hand. "I believe every word she says.",


Watching Julia's unwavering support, Ethel felt her patience wearing thin.


Gianna's lips curled in quiet delight. Seeing Ethel's frustration aimed at Grace left her feeling rather pleased.


Putting on a look of false sympathy, Gianna jumped back into the conversation. "Grandma, you shouldn't upset yourself. I actually have some wonderful news.Next week, Prof. Warren from Summit University will visit our school for a guest lecture. Ms. Dixon promised to introduce us, and if I make a good impression, I might just secure early admission to Summit."
At the mention of that name, Ethel's face brightened.She reached for Gianna's hand, brimming with excitement. "Is it true? Prof. Warren from Summit?The one whose research was published in 'Nature'?"


Gianna shot a gloating look at Grace before turning back to Ethel, her voice sweet. "Yes. Ms. Dixon says my marks in science are exceptional, so she's giving me this chance."



To Ellie Dixon,Gianna was her star pupil.


"That's wonderful, just wonderful!" said Ethel, patting Gianna's hand, her smile making the creases on her face even deeper. "This is what I expect from a Holden. Such accomplishments bring pride, not disgrace."


With a final pointed look at Grace, Ethel made her meaning plain. Grace, meanwhile, showed no reaction,appearing as though none of it concerned her at all.
###Chapter 17 Unexpected Encounter



Grace's eyes narrowed in thought. Prof. WVarren from Summit University? Did Gianna mean Terry Warren?


Her lips twitching into a faint,knowing smile.


It had been about a year since Grace last saw him and she never figured he'd show up at Briskvale High.


A few steps away, Gianna stood stiffly, digging her nails into her palms. She stared at Grace with eyes full of envy and quiet fury.


She'd make sure Grace was out of the Holden family soon. Then she would be the only pampered girl in the family.


Julia,picking up on the tension, gently reached for Grace's hand. Her voice was soft. "Grace has been working really hard. I know she'll get into a good university."


Julia always backed Grace-never doubting her, no matter what others said.


Ethel rolled her eyes, her voice sharp and bitter."Working hard? Please. She spends all her time with
those sketchy men. Tell me, what kind of future does that lead to?"



Grace didn't let it rattle her. She met Ethel's stare with a calm, even tone. "My friends are good people."


She paused, then added with a flicker of confidence in her eyes, "And college? That won't be a problem."


Ethel scowled, irritated by Grace's self-assuredness."You should learn to stay in your lane."


Grace didn't bother arguing. She just smiled, polite and cool. Just wait and see.



The next morning, whispers followed Grace as soon as she stepped onto the school grounds.


"Is that Grace Miller? Her life's a wreck, right?"


"She's pretty, but so what? I heard she only got in because of her connections."



"Word is her grades suck, and the Holden family's just paying to keep her in."


The gossip clung to her like dust, but Grace didn't blink.



She'd heard worse before. She knew who she was,and she wasn't about to start explaining herself.
She could've silenced them right there if she wanted,but she didn't. Let themtalk. Let them guess. She had her own way of proving things.


At lunch, Adrianna came over, gently placing a hot chocolate in front of her.


"I got this for you," she said, eyes hopeful. "We all like it."



Grace didn't usually drink hot chocolate, but Adrianna looked so excited she couldn't say no.


She tasted it and it was indeed great.


A small, genuine smile slipped out. "It's pretty good."


Adrianna beamed, but then her voice dropped, quiet and unsure.



"Thanks for being nice to me. You're the only one who doesn't treat me weird... because of the dark mark."



Grace looked at her, eyes briefly glancing over the mark on Adrianna's cheek. Without missing a beat,she said, "That's nothing. I'll make a cream for you at home. Use it every day and it'll fade in a month."


Adrianna's head snapped up, eyes wide and glassy."Are you serious? I've tried everything. The doctors all
say there's no fix... even laser didn't work."


Grace chuckled under her breath. "That's because they don't know what they're doing."


She gave Adrianna's shoulder a light pat. "Don't worry I got you. You'll look amazing."


Adrianna's throat tightened, but she nodded, tears threatening to spill. "I believe you."


That night, Grace didn't waste time. She pulled out her supplies and got to work on the cream.


It would take a bit of time to, get it just right,but she had all the ingredients.






Soon enough, the weekend rolled in.


Grace remembered Adrianna's invite to go shopping.A first for her, really.


They agreed to meet at the mall in the heart of the city on Saturday. The mall was packed with shops of every kind-from designer labels to tiny stores that sold the weirdest little trinkets.


Grace arrived early and wandered around a bit.


The building buzzed with energy. Grace leaned
casually by the fifth-floor railing, scrolling on her phone.



She kept her outfit simple-black high-waisted jeans,a light T-shirt tucked in, and an oversized white trench coat. Nothing flashy, but she pulled it off effortlessly.


Not far off, Demi stood twirling in front of a mirror.She wore a floral designer dress.


"Mom,does this one look good?" Demi asked, turning slightly,watching her reflection with careful eyes.


lvy nodded, all smiles. "Of course, sweetheart.You look perfect in everything."


Demi was soaking up the praise when her eyes drifted outside the store-and landed on Grace.



Her smile dropped. "Mom,"


Demi said with a frown, "isn't that Grace over there?What's she even doing here?"


Ivy looked over, her face turning sour the moment she spotted Grace.


"This isn't the kind of place she belongs," lvy said under her breath, full of scorn.


"She sure doesn't dress like she belongs," Demi mocked,looking at Grace's ordinary clothes.
"Guess she's finally hit rock bottom. That's what she gets for shoving you in that pool,"Ivy sneered.


"She just couldn't stand that I was back and lost her mind."



"Forget about Grace. We've dealt with that already.Today's for us-to find some new outfits. Don't let her spoil it," Ivy added, spotting a dress she liked and disappearing into a fitting room.


But Demi wasn't done. She flung the dress she'd been trying on toward a sales clerk, adjusted her collar, and made her way toward Grace with an extra swing in her step.


"Grace, what a surprise." Demi cooed, her voice overly sweet. "Didn't expect to see you here. Shopping?"


She never missed an opportunity to throw shade at Grace.
###Chapter 18 Nowhere Near Enough



Grace was looking down at her phone and did not even lift her eyes when Demi spoke.


Frustration flickered across Demi's face, though she forced a cheerful smile. "Grace, honestly, these clothes aren't really your thing. Just a single top here costs morethan half a year's living expenses for most people. There's a budget-friendly outlet just behind the mall-maybe that's more your speed."


Demi made her point clear by sipping slowly from her hot chocolate. Seeing Grace's discomfort seemed to make the drink all the sweeter for her.



Eventually, Grace lifted her gaze. Her eyes glinted,cold and impenetrable, as she sized up Demi."Finished talking?"


Still smiling sweetly, Demi responded, "Since we've bumped into each other, let me grab you a drink."


"I'll pass. I'd rather not be part of your drama," Grace replied.


Demi's face flushed with anger. Before she could retort, a group of girls walked by, their voices carrying
over in a whisper.


"Wow, look at that woman's white trench coat! Where do you think she bought it? She's stunning."


"Totally agree-the design looks so high-end,probably super expensive."


"True, especially compared to that tacky girl beside her."



A faint smile curled on Grace's lips. She knew her coat wasn't just any white trench-it was a limited anniversary piece, the only one in existence.


Her hand drifted to smooth a wrinkle on the sleeve,the cashmere's subtle sheen glinting beneath the lights, revealing a hidden layer of luxury.


Simple and soft, that coat had always been a favorite,striking just the right balance between comfort and elegance.


Overhearing the whispers, Demi nearly lost her composure. Her fingers clenched so tightly around the cup of hot chocolate.


Her glare followed the girls as they disappeared, her thoughts bubbling with annoyance at their so-called taste.



"Students these days wouldn't know style if it tripped
them," Demi snapped under her breath. "Clearly, they can't spot real fashion."


Were they seriously that blind? For all they knew,Grace's coat could have been bought on sale.



In her mind, nothing compared to the label stitched into her own designer outfit.


Still, seeing Grace's effortless poise stoked her resentment until it threatened to spill over.


Pretending to stumble, Demi tipped the hot chocolate right in Grace's direction.


The liquid sailed through the air. It splattered dramatically across Grace's white coat.


For a heartbeat, everything seemed to pause. Grace stared at the glaring stain as if the world had stopped turning.


A flash of triumph flickered in Demi's eyes,though she quickly hid it behind a gasp and a hand over her mouth."Oh my goodness, look what I've done! Your coat is ruined. I'm so sorry-it just slipped! I swear, it was an accident."



Reaching into her bag, she produced two hundred dollars and held it out. "Here,take this. Buy yourself a fresh coat."
When Grace made no move to accept, Demi pushed further, asking, "What's wrong? Not enough for you?I doubt you've ever even handled this much cash before. Just take it and pick something from the outlet."



Demi's sense of superiority swelled. Nothing pleased her more than the thought of Grace brought down a notch.



All she wanted now was to savor the sight of Grace finally humbled.


With a cold glare, Grace swiftly grabbed the half cup of hot chocolate out of Demi's grip and tossed the drink straight into her startled face.


The drink drenched Demi's face, smearing her makeup and leaving her hair in dripping chaos.


"You little-!" Demi screamed furiously, eyes blazing,her glare so intense it might have scorched Grace.


Just then, Ivy stepped briskly out of the fitting room,immediately spotting Grace's cold retaliation against her daughter.


In a rush, she stormed across the store, her styled hair nearly unraveling in her agitation.


Placing herself between Demi and Grace, she thrust
out a manicured hand, her bright red nails hovering dangerously close to Grace's nose.


Her voice cracked with indignation as she shouted,"Grace, don't you have any manners? Why are you always going after Demi like this?"


From behind her mother, Demi's eyes shimmered with well-timed tears. She stammered, "It was my mistake,Mom.I accidentally messed up her coat and tried to make it right, but maybe she felt it didn't cover the cost..."



Grace watched Demi's well-rehearsed performance with calm detachment. She cóuldn't help but think the world of acting would sorely miss such talent if she ever quit.


If there were awards for theatrics, Demi would sweep the ceremony.


As if sensing Grace's internal amusement,lvy erupted even further.



She yanked another two hundred dollars from her designer purse and threw it disdainfully toward Grace."How about now? Is that enough for your cheap coat?"


Without a hint of emotion, Grace met her glare."Nowhere near enough."


Stunned disbelief flashed across lvy's face.
"Don't get greedy! This is more than generous. You need to know when to stop."




Grace's tone was cold as she replied, "This coat is from Aesthetic Atelier; it's called 'Nieve'. It's an anniversary edition, one of a kind. All the money you've got wouldn't buy a single thread."
###Chapter 19 Two Hundred Thousand For Dry Cleaning



A smug grin spread across lvy's lips as she raised her voice for all to hear. "Grace, are you serious? You want us to believe that's an Aesthetic Atelier original?That coat looks like it wandered in from a thrift shop!And you expect us to buy that it's one-of-a-kind?Who do you take us for?"



Right on cue, Demi covered her mouth to hide a giggle."Please, Grace. Aesthétic Atelier is so exclusive that even celebrities get waitlisted."


Turning to the onlookers, she flashed a bold wink."Tell me I'm wrong,people."


Laughter rippled through the gathering crowd.


Grace didn't flinch. Instead, she slid her hand into her coat and pulled out a black business card that gleamed under the store lights. "Should I call the brand's director for you?"


The shimmer on the card caught every curious eye.Aesthetic Atelier's gold-stamped VIP No.001 was embossed across the surface like royalty.


Shock froze lvy's expression. That card was legendary.
Aesthetic Atelier only handed out a select few worldwide.


There was disbelief in Demi's voice as she exclaimed,"You have got to be kidding me! That is definitely a fake!"



Between the two of them, lvy and Demi had heard every Chapter of Grace's life before.


Grace came up through foster care. She was no stranger to struggle. Who on earth would give her any real status?



Grace saw no point in arguing. "Look, there's a shop up ahead. Let's see what the cashier says."


"Fine!" barked Demi, digging in her heels. She wasn't backing down without a fight. She needed to expose Grace-prove she didn't belong.



Inside the Aesthetic Atelier store, a clerk took the coat gently and examined it from collar to hem.



"This here's our anniversary release-Nieve. There's only one. The material's extremely delicate. We don't even clean it in-store. We send it to HQ and, fair warning, the cleaning cost's brutal."



Ivy and Demi stared in stunned silence, their disbelief written across their faces. It never occurred to them that Grace's coat could actually be the real deal from
Aesthetic Atelier.


Still, their minds reeled.How expensive could cleaning a coat even be?


Without a second thought, lvy pulled out her credit card and waved it at the cashier. "Go ahead and swipe it. We don't have all day."


She couldn't shake the feeling that Grace had somehow faked her way into that designer coat.


Memories from the orphanage popped up. Wealthy folks used to drop off high-end clothes, hoping for good press. It wouldn't be a surprise if Grace grabbed one to impress everyone.


The thought brought lvy a sense of relief.


Minutes dragged by, and the transaction still hadn't gone through.


Annoyed by the delay, lvy leaned forward and demanded, "How much longer is this going to take?This should have been quick."


The store clerk offered a tight, almost nervous smile."Apologies, ma'am. The cleaning service stats at two hundred thousand, and your card's been declined."


Ivy's jaw dropped. "Are you kidding me right now? Are you pulling some sort of scam?"
Unfazed, the clerk replied with a steady voice, "That's the usual charge for this garment. It's a specialty item,and care doesn't come cheap."


Demi's face turned pale as paper. "Two hundred thousand just for dry cleaning? Who charges that?You might as well rob us instead."


Still composed, the clerk nodded. "Ma'am,that's what the designer set, and trust me, it's non-negotiable."


Ivy's knees buckled slightly, and she gripped the edge of the counter to steady herself.


She couldn't remember a time when life threw something this bizarre at her.


But this? This was in another league. Two hundred thousand just to clean a coat? That was unbelievable.



Turning around, Ivy pinned Grace with a glare sharp enough to cut glass. "You planned all this, didn't you?"


Grace propped herself against the counter, twirling her phone with a lazy flick. "Your daughter kicked this off, so maybe pay the bill and apologize while you're at it."



She moved closer, her tone barely above a whisper,yet it cut sharper than a knife. "Wrecking someone's property that costs more than a grand could send you
to court. And two hundred thousand? You'll be behind bars for that..."


Fear rippled through Ivy's chest, though she forced herself to appear unfazed. "It really isn't a problem.We never refused to pay up."


Anger welled up inside her. If she could, she would have strangled Grace on the spot.


She couldn't shake the feeling that every bit of this chaos was on purpose.


Seeing no other way out, she pulled out her phone and called her husband.


At that moment, Luke was locked in a boardroom,sweating under the gaze of impatient shareholders.


The vibration of his phone was almost ignored until Ivy's desperate message made him pause.



"Just what have you dragged us into this time?" Luke growled, barely able to make sense of her frantic words.



Once he grasped the situation, he unleashed a string of curses as he sent the money.



Problems seemed to come at him non-stop. He wondered how he was supposed to keep it together.
He squeezed his eyes shut,feeling wiped out.


Since Grace walked away,his company had started to unravel. Several major clients walked out. The tech team bailed. Even the bank became impossible to deal with.


Sometimes, it felt as if the family had become haunted, chased by bad luck with Grace's name on it.


With the transfer complete, lvy didn't waste a second.She shoved her card at the cashier, eager to finish.


After a tense pause, Demi finally blurted out an apology, "Grace, I'm sorry for what happened to your coat. I'll make sure it doesn't happen again."


Grace just nodded, replying, "I don't always let things slide."



Not wasting another minute, she walked away and met with Adrianna.



Demi's hands balled into fists, nails digging in, as she glared after Grace. Anger swirled in her chest, almost numbing.


"Mom," whispered Demi, her voice trembling, "are we seriously letting her go?"


Scowling, lvy shoved her card into her purse and
seized Demi's arm. "Let's go home. Your dad's already furious."




Without another word, they rushed out.



In her own mind, lvy vowed through clenched teeth that she'd make sure Grace paid for this.
###Chapter 20 A Special Guest



Adrianna greeted Grace, a shy smile playing on her lips. "Sorry for making you wait. I'm running a little behind."



"Don't worry about it. I just arrived myself," Grace replied.



From her purse, she retrieved a small white jar and placed it in Adrianna's hand. "This is the cream I blended for you. Apply it to that dark mark before bed,and you'll start to see the spot lighten up."


Bright hope flickered in Adrianna's eyes as she accepted the small jar.


Uncapping it, she caught a fresh, gentle scent with a hint of lavender soothing her senses.


"Do you really think this'll do the trick?" Adrianna asked, her voice trembling as she lightly touched the mark clinging to her skin.


Grace gave a quiet grin. "Stick with it for a month.You'll start to see the difference."


"That's awesome!" Adrianna said, nodding with excitement as a grin spread across her face.
She tucked the cream into her purse like it was something precious, her chest swelling with hope.


That dark mark had made her easy prey for cruel nicknames and side-eyes ever since grade school.Nothing from the drugstore ever lived up to its promise, no matter how often she tried.



Even so, there was something about Grace that made her want to believe.


In Grace's eyes, the problem looked easy to fix.


Adrianna was already imagining her skin clear and glowing.She could almost see it.


Later on, the two of them started shopping. Shopping was rare for Grace, and today felt like a treat.


They roamed through shop after shop, grabbing a few tops, earrings, and whatever caught their eye.


Grace picked up a smooth silk scarf for Julia. Adrianna found a fluffy pair of slippers for her grandma.


When Grace finally got back home, she heard voices drifting in from the living room as she unlocked the door.



She paused in the hallway, wondering about the unexpected voices.
Stepping inside, Grace's eyes landed on Gianna.Wasn't she supposed to be spending the week at the estate with Ethel? What was she doing here now?


Questions swirled in Grace's mind until Julia spotted her, coming over with gentle hands to relieve her of the shopping bags.



"You're back,sweetie."



"I went out with a classmate. We did some shopping,"said Grace without flinching.


Meanwhile, Gianna lounged on the sofa, idly snacking on grapes. The moment she caught sight of Grace's shopping bags, envy sparked behind her eyes.


She hated how all the attention kept drifting away from her. In her mind, it should've never left.


Julia, missing the sharp edge in the room, smiled like everything was fine. "It's nice having friends around.Don't spend all your time holed up at home."


She added with a light chuckle, "Just so you know,Ethel won't be home recently. So Gianna's staying with us for a while. You two can keep each other company."



Back in the day, Gianna used to drop by all the time.Julia,having no daughter of her own, treated her like
royalty.

Lately, though, Gianna felt that spotlight had shifted elsewhere since Grace's arrival.

Grace gave Julia a polite nod. "Alright. Thanks for letting me know."


"I made sandwiches. There are cheese and veggie ones, and a few with shrimp and corn. I couldn't decide what you liked, so i made a little bit of everything." Julia's voice was bright with pride.


Hearing that, Grace paused, and a gentle warmth crept into her heart.


Memories of her childhood spent in orphanage and with different foster families left her unfamiliar with the comfort of a real home.



That changed now, with Julia moving through the kitchen, treating her as if she had always belonged there.



"You didn't have to go through all that trouble," Grace said softly, barely lifting her gaze. "I'm not picky."


Julia just laughed and tousled her hair. "If it makes you smile, it's worth it."



Nearby,Gianna's hands balled into tight fists, her nails digging deep into her skin. Watching this unfold was
enough to make her stomach twist.


What kind of magic had Grace pulled on Julia? This was supposed to be her spotlight. Grace wasn't even family.Just some girl they let stay.


Julia's fragile health had always been the reason she never cooked. Even Rodger and the boys made sure she rested.



Yet now, she was in the kitchen like it was her stage.All because Grace walked in.



Every gesture, every smile, every bite of affection Julia handed over looked like something Gianna had been robbed of.


The frustration boiled over. She threw her voice across the room with fake sweetness. "Grace, Aunt Julia went through all that trouble just for you, even though she's not feeling great. Better eat up."


Her words sounded friendly, but the sarcasm was hard to miss.



Tension thickened around them.



Grace turned to her, lips curved into a slow, deliberate smile. "Relax, Gianna. If my mom makes me food, I'm finishing every crumb."



Gianna's expression went stiff.
Julia, completely unaware of the brewing feud,kept her gentle tone."Don't just stand there. Gianna, would you like some sandwiches too?"


With a grin as fake as a toy, Gianna waved her off. "No thanks. I'm cutting carbs."


A glare was all she gave Grace, thinking to herself that just seeing her was enough to kill an appetite.


Food was not the reason Gianna came today. Before Ethel left, she had pulled every string she could to score a stay at Rodger's house.


Secretly, she made a promise to herself-she would find a way to push Grace out of the Holden family,no matter what it took.
###Chapter 21 Play Doctor
Gianna chimed in with extra sweetness, flashing her lashes at Julia, "Aunt Julia, Grandma asked me to care for you. She says you could use a bit of pampering while you're under the weather."


A quick, pointed look from Gianna landed on Grace,clearly hinting that Grace had no idea how to be a caring daughter.

With a lighthearted air, Grace grabbed a sandwich,waving it right under Gianna's nose and letting a grin bloom across her face. "What a shame for you.Nobody makes sandwiches like my mom does."


The first bite sent her eyes fluttering closed in pleasure. "This is exactly how a sandwich should taste."


Seeing such genuine delight, Julia's face brightened with laughter. "Like it that much? There's plenty more in the kitchen if you want."

Usually, Julia's sandwiches only appealed to Rodger.Her sons barely gave them a second glance.


Watching the heartwarming exchange, Gianna clenched her fist, so lost in envy that she barely With her hunger gone, Grace gently let her fingertips rest on Julia's wrist.


Concern settled over her features. Agentle frown formed as she felt Julia's faint, unsteady pulse.Her health seemed worse than Grace expected.


"What are you doing?" Julia asked with curiosity.


Pulling her hand away, Grace muttered, "Just checking your pulse. I once read a book that taught me how to assess someone's health just by feeling their pulse.Mom,from what I observed, you're low on energy right now. Please take it easy and keep warm. No overdoing it."


Julia's pride shone through her eyes, and her whole face lit up. "I always knew you were something special,honey!"


Reaching out, she pinched her daughter's cheek and gave her the warmest smile. "Who needs a clinic? I've got my own doctor right here at home."


A gentle happiness bubbled up in Grace, and she couldn't hide her smile.


For once, she took pride in what she could do.


She reached into her purse and produced a small sky-blue bottle patterned with tiny flowers.
"These are some energy-boosting supplements |mixed up myself," said Grace, handing Julia the bottle."Just take one every day, like it's candy. They'll help boost your energy and keep you looking beautiful."


Catching Julia's curiosity as she eyed the bottle, Grace explained, "Every ingredient is natural and lab-approved, so you won't have any side effects."


Excitement bubbling inside, Julia twisted open the cap without delay.


A gentle snap released a breeze of calming fragrance.The scent instantly brightened the room.


"That's a one-of-a-kind aroma!" Julia said, taking a long,satisfied breath. "Just smelling it makes me feel better already."


Grace's eyes sparkled, teasing, "There are some rare herbs in there you'll never find on a grocery shelf."She kept quiet about her own homegrown botanicals, ones hardly anyone else could get their hands on.


That secret mix had come straight from her personal garden.


One pill landed in Julia's palm, gleaming like a tiny pearl. She tossed it in her mouth right away, her eyes shining. "It tastes sweet! And there's this minty,refreshing kick to it."
"That's the honey and mint I added to make it taste good," Grace explaiend, pleased by Julia's reaction.Her heart warmed at the sight of Julia enjoying it so much.



"I love it!" Julia's voice rang with the delight of a child finding a treasure. "I already feel more lively, and my skin's so soft."


She ran her hand across her cheek, marveling at how smooth it felt.


A gentle laugh escaped Grace. "It's not going to work that quickly.


I've actually mixed up special supplements for Dad and the boys too. Each one is meant to help with their stress and energy."


Ever since she became part of the Holden family, she had paid close attention to everyone's health, quietly making supplements that suited their needs.


Julia stared, taking in the moment. Grace's thoughtful ways left an impression. There was no stopping the fondness she felt for her.


From her spot on the couch, Gianna finally lost her patience. "Grace, you can't just dish out homemade pills. We've got a family doctor for a reason. If Aunt Julia's sick, she knows who to call."
Her gaze fixed on the small bottle, a knot of envy tightening in her chest. How could Grace play doctor like this? Did she actually believe she was some kind of healer? None of these homemade remedies or pulse checks had ever come up before-not in this house.


To Gianna, the whole performance seemed absurd.


She was sure this was Grace's way of charming Rodger and Julia, and that was why they spoiled her. Such a suck-up.


Without so much as a glance in Gianna's direction,Grace replied, "Just wait and see. The results will speak for themselves."


A sharp, chilly laugh escaped Gianna."Oh, I'm dying to see how that turns out." She let every syllable drip with sarcasm. "I really hope you can make her better."


Not long ago, Gianna had done her homework on Grace.



Life with the Millers had branded Grace as unremarkable. Now she was strutting around like she could cure patients?


Gianna couldn't believe anyone took her seriously.


Ignoring Gianna's outburst, Grace stayed silent.Proving someone wrong was better than arguing.


Julia soon looped Grace into a lighter conversation,leaving the tension behind.


Bored, Gianna spoke up. "I'll go unpack my things now."





With a strained grin, she excused herself from the room.





Her smile faded the second her back was turned,replaced by a steely, plotting glare.
###Chapter 22 Tracking Her Down
Inside Briskvale High, the usual school day faded into the background as Gianna made her way to the office the instant the dismissal bell sounded.


With a measured politeness, Gianna asked, "Did you need something from me, Ms. Dixon?"


"So, Grace Miller is related to you? I only just found out," Ellie said, her forehead wrinkling with concern.


The question caught Gianna off guard. Quickly,she replied, "Grace was adopted by my uncle from an orphanage."


Ellie's lips twisted in disdain. A sharp breath escaped her as she replied, "No wonder she's rude."


A subtle breath of relief slipped from Gianna. She nodded, saying, "She also spent her childhood bouncing between foster families and the orphanage.So she is a bit eccentric."


Putting on a show of worry, she heaved a sigh and added, "My uncle wanted to help, so he brought Grace home. No one expected she'd end up causing trouble."


Adjusting her glasses with practiced annoyance, Ellie spoke. "It's hardly shocking she mouthed off at me during the test. That's what comes from a lack of proper upbringing."


From her desk, she produced a test paper, her movements brisk. "Here. You should see these-her scores from the placement test."


She had kept the results hidden, fully intending to flaunt them at the upcoming exam, eager to embarrass Grace in front of everyone.


Rising through the ranks from nothing, Ellie wore her authority like armor and never tolerated anyone, much less a student, being rude to her.


The paper landed in Gianna's hands. Her eyes widened at the glaring red mark sprawled across the top.


Could this actually be real? Wasn't Grace always ranked at the bottom of every class? Hadn't everyone whispered that she barely made the cut?


Trying to mask her surprise, Gianna forced a shaky smile. "Ms. Dixon, is it possible there's been some kind of mistake?"


Ellie's patience snapped. Her palm hit the desk with a smack. "Grace must have cheated! What other explanation is there for a student with her record to score that high?"


Gianna fidgeted with her sleeve. "Maybe my uncle arranged for Grace to get some extra help, like a private tutor or something..."


Ellie let out a snort of disbelief. "A tutor? Please. Her history speaks for itself. Not even the brightest mind could drag her up from where she started." She rattled the paper in her grip. "I'll be keeping an eye on her during the next exams. If she pulls another stunt, she's finished here!"



For a split second, Gianna's satisfaction threatened to show, but she quickly replaced it with an anxious expression. "Please, don't take it to heart. I'll do my best to talk some sense into her."


"You're a sensible girl, Gianna. Try not to get mixed up with her. I want to see you succeed. You're my top student. I'll be giving you more advanced lessons soon,so when Prof. Warren stops by, you'll stand out from the rest."


Though her heart raced with excitement, Gianna played the part of the modest student. "Thank you for having faith in me. I'll put in my best effort, but with so many gifted students around, I worry I might fall short."


A gentle smile touched Ellie's lips. "You shouldn't doubt yourself. Your fundamentals are rock solid. If you keep this up, Summit University will be within reach.Prof. Warren is coming to find new talent, and that research article you published really made people take notice. He might already know your name, so stand tall."


A simple nod from Gianna sealed her determination.


Ellie reached over and handed Gianna a fresh stack of practice exercises to complete.


Winning a place for Gianna at Summit would cement Ellie's status as the school's top educator.


Meanwhile, the classroom buzzed with excitement as word spread.


Terry Warren was almost a legend, famous for pushing the boundaries of research. Landing a place on his team could set a student up for a remarkable career.


Small groups gathered, energy rising as the news of Terry's visit traveled through the halls.


"I heard Prof. Warren's group published three 'Nature'papers last year. That's wild!"


"Anyone who joins his lab has a one-way ticket to academic stardom!"


"Let's be real. Gianna White's got that spotin the bag.Ms. Dixon's been preparing her for ages."


Grace ignored the whispers, choosing not to get involved, but she genuinely felt happy to see Terry doing so well.
The school day drew to a close.


Parked just beyond the gates, a polished black SUV hummed softly. Behind the wheel, Colton lounged with a watchful gaze fixed on the steady stream of students.



With a calm edge in his voice, he asked, "Dominick, are you certain this information checks out?"


Dominick responded with careful respect, "Yes, I've verified it. That girl's name is Grace Miller, and she's in the same classas Charles Pearson."


What were the odds of this connection?


A hint of irritation clouded Colton's face as his thoughts grew heavier. Tracking Grace down todayhad become his mission-he needed answers about her earlier remarks. At their very first encounter,she had immediately figured out that he was suffering from poison. She definitely knew something.


Right then, Grace stepped outside, her posture relaxed as she scanned the sidewalk.



Dominick wasted no time and made his way toward her.



She stopped in her tracks, taking in the sight of the familiar face. Wasn't this the same man who had fiercely competed against her for an item in the underground market? Why was he tracking her down now?


Her gaze narrowed as suspicion took hold. Maybe he'd come to reclaim the item? But that ship had sailed-she'd already used it for her medicines.


Trying to appear composed, Dominick addressed her."Miss Miller, my employer, Mr. Pearson, would like a moment of your time, if that's alright?"


Grace's voice held steady. "I have no idea who you people are."


Dominick apologized quickly, his anxiety clear as sweat appeared along his hairline. "Sorry for the trouble,truly."


He darted a look between her and the SUV, clearly anxious to get this over with.


With a resigned sigh, Grace gave in. "Fine,I'l hear what he has to say."
###Chapter 23 A Miracle Pill
Grace knew the two men would keep pestering her if she didn't go along. She decided it was smarter to figure out their intentions.


"Please follow me," Dominick said, practically glowing when she agreed.


As Grace approached, her eyes settled on Colton, and a faint frown tugged at her mouth.


Turned out it really was the guy knocking on death's door.



Dominick was just about to introduce them when Ryan Clark, Colton's friend, suddenly yelled, "Colton! Are you having another attack?"


Colton clutched his chest without warning. His skin lost color, his lips turned bluish, and he struggled to breathe.



Grace's face shifted. She reached into her pocket,pulled out a small blue vial, tapped out a deep brown pill, and held it toward them. "Make him take this."


Ryan squinted at the odd-looking pill, his mouth twitching. "You serious with this?"
She had to be kidding,right?


Grace stayed composed. "Don't believe in it?"


Colton took the pill from her, rubbing his thumb across the surface, catching the sharp, clean scent of herbs.


"It's not something you can just buy," Grace said calmly. "Don't underestimate it."


Her certainty made them hesitate.


Ryan leaned in, murmuring, "Don't take it."


A pill like that, who knew what it could do if it went wrong?


Grace gave a short, humorless laugh and reached out her palm. "If you're scared, then give it back to me."


It was rare for her to offer anything like this; now she almost looked like she was pleading with them.


Colton didn't flinch. He tossed the pill into his mouth.


The pill melted the instant it touched his tongue. A wave of warmth surged through his limbs, chasing off the chill that had settled in his bones and easing the stabbing pain in his chest.


He shut his eyes briefly, then opened them again,blinking in disbelief. "It works."


He hadn't felt this relieved since the poison effects  began.Now,heat radiated through his body.


Ryan turned to Grace, stunned. "What was that pill you gave him?"


Grace's lips lifted slightly. Her tone was easy."The kind that keeps him breathing."


Color slowly returned to Colton's cheeks, and the tightness in his muscles began to release. He drew in a long breath, the cold that had wrapped around his chest finally retreating.


Ryan's brow furrowed, his voice low. "Your attacks are getting worse. At this rate, even Dr. Q's treatment won't be enough. We've got to find that doctor, fast."


At the mention of Dr. Q, something unreadable crossed Grace's face, but she covered it up in an instant.


Colton looked over at her, his voice still unstable."Sorry for the trouble, Miss Miller. How did you pick up on the poisoning that day?"


Grace didn't blink. Her reply came cool and clipped."I've got eyes."


Ryan studied her, probing. "Spotting that so fast,you must know your way around medicine?"


Grace rolled her sleeve back down, her tone flat. "I know a little."
Colton could tell she was keeping her distance.


He offered a nod of thanks. "Appreciate your help.Would you care to join us for dinner?"


Grace shook her head. "I've got to head home."


Without waiting for a response, she turned and walked away.


"Hey!" Ryan stood frozen, watching her leave,completely thrown. Was she playing some kind of game, or just out of her mind?


Every debutante in the city bent over backward to catch Colton's attention. And Grace? She bolted like she'd been shot at.


Colton watched her retreating figure, his thoughts unreadable.


Dominick leaned in slightly. "What next?"


Before Colton could respond, a sudden tension gripped his face. A strange heat flared through him,sweat breaking out across his back. The sensation came without warning-sharp and overwhelming.


Ryan noticed the shift right away. "What's going on?"


He smacked the steering wheel. "It's that pill, isn't it?No wonder she vanished!"


Colton's jaw tightened. He loosened his tie, his fingers moving stiffly.


What had started as a gentle warmth was now burning through him like wildfire. But the strangest part was his legs, they itched and ached, like something was crawling beneath the surface.


"Drive to the hospital," Colton said hoarsely, a vein throbbing at his temple.


Ryan slammed his foot down. The SUV shot forward,tires screeching against the pavement.


In the mirror, Ryan saw Colton's complexion deepen to a shade of red that screamed distress.


"Hang on, we're nearly there," he muttered, his voice strained, silently blaming Gace a hundred times over.If anything happened to Colton, she'd answer for it.


"Hold on." Colton suddenly lifted a hand, his voice filled with shock. "I can feel my legs."


Ryan whipped his head around. "You serious?"


Colton lifted his shirt, those poison-triggered bumps were fading,vanishing right in front of them.


It was amazing.
###Chapter 24 She's Your Lucky Charm
Through the rearview mirror, Ryan's eyes sparkled with anticipation. "We're almost at the hospital. Dr. Payne will be ready to run a full set of checks on you as soon as we arrive!"
mysterious condition.


"Really? That's incredible news!" Ryan broke into a wide grin, the relief in his voice impossible to miss.


Lewis nudged his glasses up and explained in a careful tone, "Initial results suggest that the toxin levels have dropped. But it's too soon to tell whether this is justa brief respite or a genuine cure."


A gleam of curiosity lit up his eyes. "Whoever stepped in must be a genius. I'd jump at the chance to learn from that doctor."


Intensity flickered in Colton's stare. The simple pill Grace handed him had worked wonders-far outstripping the expensive procedures and endless therapies his doctors had tried for years.


He found himself wondering about her true identity.


With a broad smile, Ryan clapped his hands together."Colton, you just got a miracle! That girl-she's your lucky charm!"


Thoughts of Grace's steady composure crept into Colton's mind, and a faint smile played on his lips. "At the very least, this buys us more time to track down Dr.Q."


Rubbing his palms together, Ryan could hardly contain his excitement. "We'll double the offer! If one billion wasn't enough, then two should do it. Money talks, and she's bound to listen!"


Rubbing his brow, Colton replied in a quiet tone,"Somehow, I doubt money is her main concern."


Despite everything, he found himself intrigued by Grace. She seemed to hold answers he desperately needed.


For once, fate had handed him a surprise he welcomed.




He was certain that another meeting with Grace wasn't far off.






Rather than wait in the endless line of cars, Grace decided to make her way home on her own.


She made a quick stop at a charming old ice cream shop, treating herself to a cone.


Cool vanilla and creamy milk flavors lingered as she wandered along, enjoying every bite.


Noticing the sky turning darker, she quickened her steps,determined not to let Rodger and Julia worry.


Once she reached the porch, Julia appeared, beaming warmly. Swinging the ornate door wide open, she said,"You're just in time. There's something important we

Twisting in his seat, Dominick's concern was plain."How are you holding up,Mr.Pearson?"


Colton shifted his feet with careful attention, surprise flickering across his face. "The heat inside me is gone,and I'm feeling more comfortable now."


Resting his hand against his knee, he added, "What's more...I can actually feel my legs again."


Poisoning had left him numb from the waist down for what felt like ages.


Hearing this, Ryan's hands tightened around the wheel,knuckles turning white.


Having known Colton for years, he understood exactly what that change implied. This was the first time in three years sensation had returned to Colton's legs.


Soon, the black Cayenne pulled up to the main doors of the Pearson Group's exclusive medical center.
Set on the edge of town, this pristine facility gleamed in the afternoon sun, staffed with elite doctors and packed with state-of-the-art technology-all under the Pearson name.


"Mr. Pearson has arrived!" a medical staff member called out as the team hurried to meet him, already prepped for his visit.


Lewis Payne hurried over with long strides. As an internationally renowned medical expert, he'd been recruited by the Pearson family three years prior, solely to oversee Colton's care.


Trailing behind him were six renowned specialists, each looking serious and focused.


"Another flare-up, Mr. Pearson?" Lewis asked, peering over his glasses at Colton's flushed features. "We'll get you started on a complete assessment right away."


Without missing a beat, he coordinated a series of tests for Colton.


About ten minutes later, he reviewed the results, his expression shifting from confusion to surprise. "Mr.Pearson, some of the toxins have disappeared from your system. Did you receive any new treatment recently?"


The revelation stunned Lewis; his entire team had spent years chasing dead ends with Colton's need to talk about together."


Gianna occupied a quiet corner, absorbed in her book and barely making a sound.


With a graceful flourish, Julia produced an invitation adorned with elegant details. "Take a look at what showed up today."


With careful fingers, she opened it. "This is an invitation to a high-profile banquet happening this weekend,exclusively for young women from influential families. The city's most prominent ladies will be attending. I believe it would be a great opportunity for you two to mingle and learn."


Every year, the Holden family found themselves on the guest list for gatherings like this.


Over time, Gianna had become quite familiar with these grand affairs, using them to build close connections with the city's upper crust.


At first, the idea of another elegant banquet brought a spark of excitement to Gianna.


Yet the idea of Grace joining in quickly erased her enthusiasm.


The thought alone was laughable. In her eyes, Grace was nothing more than an outsider, someone who didn't understand the unwritten rules of the social elite.
She felt certain Grace would only make a spectacle of herself.


As for Grace, banquets like these held little appeal,since she saw herself blending into the background,unnoticed.


Still, she understood her mother's reasoning-Julia wanted her to find her place as quickly as possible.


Spotting the hope shining in Julia's eyes, Grace managed a nod. "Okay, I'll go."


"That's wonderful news, Grace! You'll have the chance to meet so many interesting people," Julia exclaimed,her whole face lighting up. "I've already ordered custom gowns from Maison Blanche. They'll be delivered tomorrow."


She clapped with delight. "Wait until you see the one with all the sparkling details!"


Gianna finally set her book aside and spoke up, her voice soft but measured. "If there's anything you're unsure about, you can always ask me."


The warmth in her tone was flawless, but to Grace, it felt distant, like those glimmering displaysin fancy shop windows-impressive, yet far removed from reality.
###Chapter 25 New Gowns
Gianna, though reluctant, couldn't oppose the decision.





Almost at once, a planformed in her mind.


Letting Grace-the awkward outsider-mingle with polished socialites could turn the tables in her favor.Surely, the experience would open Grace's eyes to how misplaced she truly was.


Rooms would be filled with polished young women,every one a perfect picture of grace and refinement.


Coming from the orphanage, Grace would struggle to find her footing among them.


A smirk flickered at the corners of Gianna's mouth,with a glint of contempt shining through her gaze.


The thought of Grace stumbling or faltering in front of that critical audience was already sweet.


In that world, heritage and polished manners carried al the weight. How could someone with no background or refinement possibly hope to belong?


Morning arrived with a delivery of gowns.


Descending the staircase, Gianna immediately noticed the collection of gowns draped across the living room couch.


Her eyes locked onto a charming yellow gown that immediately drew her in. Its youthful charm,bright and full of life, was unmistakable.


Julia's cheerful voice called out, "Gianna, come try this on and see if it needs any tweaks."


Smiling to herself, Gianna approached and trailed her fingers across the soft fabric, clear approval in her expression.


"This is lovely. Thank you for choosing it for me,"she replied gently, her voice smooth and respectful.


Julia gave her an approving nod. "Go ahead and put it on. If it isn't a perfect fit, the designer can fix it up in no time."



With a grateful nod, Gianna gathered the gown and slipped away to her room.


Inside, she lingered in front of the mirror, taking in the gown's refined details-the precise stitches, the airy chiffon, and the elegant embroidery all spoke of expert craftsmanship.


Once she slipped into the gown and caught her reflection, she couldn't help but twirl, light spilling over her as the skirt fluttered around her legs. She looked every bit the image of radiance, with her skin glowing and her movements full of grace.


Admiring her reflection, she felt certain she embodied everything a socialite should be.


Every inch of her radiated confidence-she was sure all eyes would be on her that night.


Thoughts of Grace's appearance in a gown sparked a restless curiosity within her.


Descending the stairs in her gown, she caught Julia's attention right away. Julia's face brightened. "Gianna,you look absolutely beautiful, just like a princess."


With practiced modesty, Gianna lowered her eyes,smiling sweetly, all the while swelling with pride beneath the surface.


Casting a casual glance around the room, she asked,"So, which gown did Grace pick? Has she made a choice yet?"


Julia gestured toward a different gown, this one a deep blue hue. "The designer chose this for her, thinking it fit her perfectly. The moment I saw it, I knew it was right for her."


Whatever warmth Gianna had felt was gone the instant her eyes landed on the gown. It was a blue gown,studded with sparkling stones, shimmering with a quiet  at most elegance, more sophisticated than anything she owned.


Without thinking, Gianna's grip tightened on her own skirt, jealousy prickling beneath her calm exterior. The gown meant for Grace was inarguably more breathtaking and distinctive than her own.


"Don't you think it's a bit too grown-up? Maybe this design isn't quite right for her?" Gianna's smile looked forced, and her tone betrayed her discomfort.


With a gentle smile, Julia responded, "I disagree.Grace may be young, but she carries herself with a maturity beyond her years. This gown will only set her apart."


Bitterness crept in as Gianna pressed her lips together.Set her apart? Grace was nothing more than an orphan. Why should she be given such a stunning gown?


It was obvious now-Julia favored Grace.


Moments later, footsteps sounded on the stairs.


"Grace, come and try your gown on!" Julia's cheerful voice called out, filled with encouragement.


A flash of astonishment crossed Grace's face when she caught sight of the blue gown, but she quickly smoothed her expression. With gentle hands, she gathered up the gown and quietly made her way upstairs to change.


Soon, the sound of approaching footsteps echoed down the staircase.


Gianna's head snapped up, and her eyes narrowed in an instant.


Grace took her time coming down, every step highlighting how well the blue gown suited her figure.


Against her flawless skin, the color looked luminous.Her slender figure was complemented by the gown's elegant cut. Yet, above all, it was Grace's calm assurance that truly stood out.


Julia's voice brimmed with delight. "Grace, you look absolutely perfect! I just know you'll turn heads at the event."



"That's because you always know what suits me,"Grace replied with a smile. She felt genuine warmth radiating from this family.


Watching from the side, Gianna's jealousy simmered beneath her pleasant mask.


In that moment, Grace looked every inch the princess,regal and composed. Standing beside her, she felt as if her own glow had been dimmed.


If nothing changed before the big night, she was certain to become the butt of everyone's jokes.


Since both outfits fit flawlessly, there was no need for adjustments, and the boutique staff quietly departed.


However, Grace's glamorous look continued to gnaw at Gianna. The very idea of being outshone by Grace was unbearable.


She could hardly bear to look at her another second.


Letting Grace take all the attention was simply not an option, and a new plan began to take shape in her mind.
###Chapter 26 Make Alterations To Her Dress

Days slipped by, and soon the weekend brought the long-awaited socialite event.



Excitement buzzed in the air as the big gathering finally drew near.



Even though they weren't expected at the venue until later in the day, both Grace and Gianna woke up with the sun, eager to begin their preparations. A full morning of dressing and styling awaited them.



After washing up, Grace made her way to her closet, ready to pull out her gown and plan out her morning routine with hair and makeup following breakfast.


But as she swung open the wardrobe doors,her eyes went straight to a glaring problem.The hem of her stunning gown, once flawless, was now ripped unevenly, as though someone had slashed it with something sharp.


Her hands stilled on the fabric, and a frown creased her face.



Disappointment settled in her chest; the culprit was painfully obvious.


With a small, resigned smile, she ran her fingers across the ruined edge. "How childish."



Julia's knock echoed through the room at that moment. "Grace, are you up yet?"


Swinging the door open with the dress in hand, Grace greeted her. "Morning."



"Morning, honey. Come downstairs for breakf-" Julia's words faded as her gaze landed on the ruined gown.


For a second, shock kept her silent. Hurrying over, she examined the damage. "Howdid this happen? Was it just an accident? Let me call the boutique and see if they can do an urgent repair."


Grace gave a quiet shake of her head."There's not enough time for that."


A flicker of worry crossed Julia's face. "So what are we supposed to do? I should have had a second dress ready foryou."


Just then, footsteps sounded on the stairs,and Gianna appeared, a mask of concern plastered on her face. "Grace, aren't you getting ready? The stylist will arrive any minute."


Her gaze flicked to the shredded gown, and Gianna put on a show of shock. "Oh no,how did this happen? Did someone from the staff ruin it by mistake?"


Right away, she deflected responsibility toward the household staff. A brief glint of smugness flashed in her eyes, barely concealed.


Now that Grace's gown was in tatters, what would she possibly do for the big night?
Watching eagerly, Gianna waited to see how Grace could ever hope to outshine her now.



Meanwhile, Julia's nerves frayed at the edges. Her daughter's first appearance in high society could not be ruined by something like this. "This is a disaster, and there's hardly any time left!"


Trying to sound genuinely helpful, Gianna chimed in, "Aunt Julia, please don't be upset.My closet is full of gowns, and most of them have only seen the light of day once. If nothing else works, let's pick one out for Grace to wear."



Julia pressed her lips together, mulling over the suggestion. Borrowing Gianna's old dress was not her first choice, but with the clock ticking, it might be the only solution.



But Grace remained unruffled. "That won't be necessary. I've got it covered. Mom, do we still have a sewing kit in the house?"


Julia nodded at once and asked a servant to bring it upstairs.
Confusion clouded her face. "What do you want it for?"



"I can take care of the repair myself," Grace answered with quiet certainty.



Fortunately, thedamage had spared most of the gown, tearing only at the hem and making it less of a challenge.


The sewing kit opened with a snap. Grace found the scissors and, without hesitation,trimmed away the ruined section.


Shock registered on Gianna's face. Was Grace actually serious? How could she think she could handle such a delicate repair alone? This wasn't just any dress-it was a custom creation from Maison Blanche,and she intended to fix it as if it were an ordinary frock.



Trying to disguise her scorn, Gianna warned,"Grace, tonight's gathering is the real deal.All the most polished young women will be there in designer gowns. Maybe you shouldn't make any rash changes."
 That midnight blue dress was no ordinary gown-it was a coveted Maison Blanche original, instantly recognized among the city's elite.



Barely glancing up, Grace replied coolly, "I'm not interested in wearing someone else's hand-me-downs."



Gianna recoiled at the remark, her mood turning sour. "At least borrowing a dress would be better than showing up in something you butchered," she replied,forcing a grin as she tried to hide her glee.


She wondered what kind of disaster Grace's patchwork solution would become. Pulling it off seemed impossible for her.



Meeting Grace's gaze, Gianna quickly glanced away. "I was only trying to help lf you're set on doing it alone, that's your choice."



"If you've got spare time, perhaps you should figure ouut how the gown ended up damaged in the first place. It was kept at home, after all," Grace remarked coolly.



An uneasy chill crept through Gianna;suspicion flickered in her mind that Grace knew more than she let on. No words came from her after that. She kept her thoughts to herself.



"Mom, trust me. I'm going to make it look even better," Grace said to Julia, her voice full of assurance.


Suppressing an eye roll, Gianna bit back a retort.



What a boast! Make it better? How did she manage to sound so sure of herself?



Eagerness bubbled within Gianna, certain Grace would embarrass herself.



Both Julia and Gianna watched closely as Grace took up her needle and thread,settling on the edge of the bed. Swvift hands set to work, stitching with surprising skill.


Thirty minutes passed, and Grace reappeared, now dressed in the restored gown. Julia and Gianna stared in disbelief.


The hem, once ruined, had been masterfully reshaped into an asymmetric cut, the former rip now embellished with delicate sparkling diamonds. As Grace moved, the tiny stones shimmered like stardust.



No hint of damage remained. If anything, the dress had never looked so exquisite.



Gianna's eyes flew wide, and her fingers pressed sharp crescents into her palms.Never in her wildest dreams did she expect Grace to pull off something so creative.


Pure delight shone from Julia's face as she took Grace's hand. "Oh, dear, you've outdone yourself! This is even lovelier than it was before!"



Undeniably, the gown's transformation perfectly matched Grace's poise and beauty.
###Chapter 27 Grace's Creative Abilities
Stunned by the display, Julia could hardly believe her eyes.



A quiet sense of admiration settled in. Her daughter was truly exceptional.


Without a touch of makeup or a single accessory, Grace radiated an effortless,almost otherworldly elegance.


Watching from the side, Gianna realized she had completely underestimated Grace's creative abilities.



Turning slightly, Grace admired her reflection and nodded in approval. "I'm all set. I'll take care of my hair and makeup later."



Tasks like this hardly fazed her.



"You never cease to amaze me. You're such a wonderful surprise," Julia said, her face aglow with pride, grateful for a daughter so much like herself.



Across the room, Gianna watched in silent agony, envy simmering just beneath her sweet facade.



Her hand tightened around her dress, so fiercely that her knuckles paled.



She exhaled slowly, willing herself to appear pleasant. "Grace, you have a real gift, but..."


Drawing out her words, she tried to sound helpful. "Socialite events usually require a professional touch. Don't you want the stylist to handle it?"



While Grace pinned her hair up in the mirror,she answered with quiet confidence, "I appreciate it, but nobody knows my look better than I do."


A sense of helpless irritation settled over Gianna.



In swift, practiced motions, Grace's slender hands twisted her hair into a chic bun,a few loose strands framing her face and adding a lively air.



Delight shone in Julia's eyes. "You can even style your hair like that?"



"| learned by helping the girls at the orphanage with their hair," Grace replied lightly, lifting a brush and sweeping color across her skin.



Every move spoke of confidence, and soon her makeup looked as if it belonged on a magazine cover, enhancing every one of her striking features.



A look of disbelief froze Gianna in place.



There was nothing unrefined about her now.How did she pick up all these skills?


Lowering her eyes to the pale yellow gown she wore, Gianna suddenly felt it looked shabby beside Grace's quiet sophistication.


It dawned on her that her own appearance needed a serious upgrade.



Walking side by side with Grace meant all eyes would measure them, and she feared falling short in every comparison.



Frustration burned inside her, but she could do nothing about it.



"Let's get going," Julia said, checking the time and admiring Gianna and Grace."You both look absolutely beautiful today."


Forcing a polite smile, Gianna kept her true feelings buried beneath the surface.



Choosing to linger a step behind, she accepted that her first plan had failed-now it was time to try something else.



Climbing into the car, Gianna seized her chance and let her heel "accidentally" land on the hem of Grace's gown.


Triumph flashed in her eyes-until Grace turned with effortless poise, her gown swirling out of harm's way in a silken sweep.
"Watch your step, Gianna," Grace said,steadying her with a gentle hand and a cool,almost playful smile. "Those designer shoes must have cost a fortune. It would be a pity to scuff them."



A flush of embarrassment crept up Gianna's cheeks.



She sent a withering glare at Grace's back,silently vowing, "Just wait-once we're at the party, I'll see to it you're humiliated in front of everyone."



Their car rolled smoothly through city streets, heading for the grand venue. Gianna never noticed the fleeting reflection in the window-Grace had caught every flicker of resentment in her eyes.



Normally, Grace ignored petty slights. But when someone crossed the line, she knew exactly how to strike back.







Inside the dazzling lobby of a five-star hotel,
the gathering was already underway.



By the time Grace and Gianna arrived, the other socialites had settled in, greeting each other with effortless charm.



Eager to avoid being measured against Grace, Gianna surged ahead, while Grace trailed behind at an easy, unhurried pace.



Reaching the elevator, Grace reached out to press the button when a familiar voice called out, "Hold on,please."



Then, someone wearing a pink dress entered.



Demi had spent too much time fussing over her outfit and nearly convinced herself she'd be late.



Luck seemed to be on her side-she hadn't missed a thing.



Inside the mirrored space, her gaze landed instantly on Grace, whose presence seemed to command the entire room.
Recognition flickered across Demi's face,her eyes narrowing as she blurted out, "Grace,what brings you here? Don't tell me you're actually attending the gathering!"



Grace let out a sigh, wishing fate had spared her from bumping into Demi. Still, curiosity nudged at her. Since when did Demi move in these circles?



What Grace didn't know was that the Miller family had pulled strings to ensure Demi's name was on the guest list.


A small smirk tugged at Grace's lips as she sized up Demi's ensemble. Every inch of Demi screamed brand obsession, as if her only goal was to remind everyone how expensive her taste was. That bright pink dress, festooned with designer logos,screamed for attention but fell miles short of true sophistication.



After a brief, chilly pause, Grace met her gaze. "Is that a dog making all that noise?Sure sounds like one to me."
Fury flashed across Demi's face as she realized Grace was taunting her. "Grace, can you stop being so nasty for once? You're unbelievably rude!"


Grace chuckled lightly. "Oh, it's just you. I didn't even notice."






"You really need a reality check. You don't belong in this world-orphans aren't welcome here," Demi retorted, bristling with resentment.



How thick-skinned could Grace be to show up here!






Determined to drag Grace down, Demi promised herself she'd reveal her for who she truly was before the night ended.
###Chapter 28 Being Accused Of Stealing
Light from the grand chandelier spilled across the hall, mixing with the scent of expensive perfumes and the buzz of animated conversation.



With each step, Grace moved through the entrance, her blue dress catching the glow and creating a halo around her, the fabric whispering over her skin and exuding a dreamy sophistication.



Instantly, heads turned in her direction, their admiration barely concealed.



Surrounded by a lively group, Gianna caught the sudden shift as attention drifted to the doorway.



Her gaze snapped toward the entrance,and there was Grace, moving with a calm confidence that made Gianna's hands curl  tightly at her sides.


Someone nearby leaned in close, voice dropping to a whisper. "Who is that girl?"


"That's the girl the Holden family adopted from an orphanage,isn't it?"


"She looks so refined-honestly, even more elegant than Gianna tonight."


"Not so loud. Gianna's right there."


"So what? She's just crashing with Ethel. If Rodger and Julia really cared, wouldn't they have adopted her themselves? Makes you wonder," one woman said dismissively.


Every sly remark drifted into Gianna's ears,making her smile feelbrittle at the edges.


She drew in a slow breath, collected herself,and made her way toward Grace,champagne glass in hand.



"There you are, Grace." Her words rang out sweetly, though tension tugged at every syllable. "I've been searching for you   everywhere-l worried you'd gotten lost."



A gentle, almost amused look crossed Grace's face. "I'm fine. You should go enjoy your friends. I can take care of myself."


Having Gianna nearby would only stir up more drama.



The blunt dismissal took Gianna by surprise.Barely managing to keep her smile, she leaned in, her voice soft with fake concern."You'll find a lot of well-connected girls here tonight. You're new to all this, so just be careful."



Grace nodded with quiet confidence. "appreciate it. I know how to handle myself."


Unmoved by Grace's composure, Gianna masked her irritation with a heavy sigh."Alright, but let me know if you need help."


Turning away, she sank her heels into the plush carpet, each step carrying her frustration further.
A huff of irritation escaped her, hidden by practiced poise.






Her manners remained flawless, but deep down, she wished nothing more than for Grace to trip up in front of everyone.



Not far from the entrance, Sonia Richardson -the host's daughter-caught Gianna's eye and gave an enthusiastic wave.


Without missing a beat, Gianna put on a sweet smile and hurried over to greet her.


"Is that the new addition to your family?"Sonia asked, linking arms and sending a pointed look Grace's way.



Lowering her voice and putting on an air of reluctant acceptance, Gianna replied,"That's her. My uncle brought her home from the orphanage. She bounced around foster homes before landing with us."



Her words barely faded before a cluster of girls surrounded them, voices bubbling with excitement.
"It all makes sense now-she doesn't have that classic high-society look."


"She may look the part, but I wonder if she has what it takes beneath the surface."



"You're being generous, Gianna. Personally,I don't know if l'd be so gracious with an unexpected addition to the family."



Raising her glass, Gianna let the bubbles linger on her tongue before replying with a soft,measured tone, "It's all been decided by the family. My job is just to keep an eye on her,nothing more."


Yet behind her gentle words, a cold spark lit her eyes.


Festivities rolled on, lively and bright, as the clink of crystal and bursts of laughter filled the hall.


All the laughter and cheer grated on Grace's nerves, only strengthening her distaste for such events.
Craving escape, she made her way toward the open terrace to breathe in the cool night.



She had barely started down the corridor before a cluster of girls stepped into her path.



Sonia lifted her arm, letting the chandelier's light dance across a bracelet studded with diamonds.



A smirk polayed on her lips as she addressed Grace, her words dripping with pride. "Take a look. This was made just for my eighteenth-there's nothing else like it anywhere."



"Oh my, it sparkles so much! It's absolutely stunning. I wish I had something like that,"said Sonia's friends, unable to hide their awe.



With a sweet voice laced in admiration,Gianna suggested, "Sonia, only someone as refined as you could do justice to a piece that special."



Rolling her eyes, Grace masked her irritation behind a blank expression. Honestly, did these girls have any pastime beyond endlessly heaping praise on one another?



A lazy glance at Sonia's prized bracelet told Grace all she needed to know-those diamonds looked disappointingly puny, and whoever cut them clearly lacked skill.



She had to wonder-was this spectacle really about a bracelet so mediocre?



Grace's thoughts wandered to the plain box stashed beneath her bed, filled with loose stones that made Sonia's accessory look like a child's toy.



With a steady voice, Grace asked, "Would you kindly let me through?" Without waiting for a reply, she continued on her way toward the terrace.



Snickers and whispered insults trailed behind her, saying, "She's never even seen real jewelry before."



Taking a moment on the terrace, Grace soaked in the peace before slipping away toward the bathroom.



No sooner had she stepped outside than a female attendant in crisp uniform thrust an accusing finger in her direction, her voice rising above the chatter. "That's her! I saw it with my own eyes-she's the one who stole it!"



In an instant, every head turned, the air thick with judgment from the watching socialites.



Grace's lips pressed together in a thin,annoyed line. What was this lunatic going on about now? Why was she suddenly the villain of the attendant's story?
###Chapter 29 An Airtight Setup

Without warning, Sonia swept into the center of the room, her entourage in tow, her voice sharp and accusing. "Grace Miller, I can't believe you're the one who stole my diamond bracelet!"



Off to the side, Gianna staged her reaction,eyes wide as she pressed her hand to her lips. "Grace, how could you? I can't believe this!"



Brows knitted in confusion, Grace took in the accusing faces. Her voice stayed even as she replied, "I have no idea what you're talking about. What bracelet?"



Sonia scoffed, flashing her empty wrist."Drop the act. My bracelet vanished, and you're the only one who came near me. If you didn't take it, then who did?"


Murmurs rippled through the group, the other girls quick to pile on.



"You can't trust someone raised in an orphanage. Anything shiny would be too much to resist!"



"Check her purse! That's where she's hidden it!"






"Don't let her get away with this, Sonia. You should call the police."






The realization hit Grace as she watched their accusing faces. Someone was clearly trying to pin the blame for theft on her. Her eyes shifted toward Sonia, and right then,she noticed that the diamond bracelet had vanished. With a steady voice, he looked around at the group and said, "I didn't steal anything."



Sonia retorted, pride in every word, "Oh, so you're too frightened to admit what you did?"



"If you have Sonia's diamond bracelet,Grace, please just give it back to her. She really cares about it. If it's jewelry you want,I'll buy you another one some other time,"said Gianna softly.



A flash of annoyance crossed Grace's face."I can't hand it over, because I never took it in the first place."



Hearing her response, Sonia reached for her purse, her patience worn thin.


Grace darted out of reach, leaving Sonia nearly off balance. "What's your problem?"Grace snapped, her stare icy and unwavering.



Sonia's tone turned sharp, her irritation fueled by the stumble. "Got something to hide? Why don't you just let us look?" Her voice rose, echoing across the room."Security! Come here quick!"



All the noise pulled in even more curious onlookers, the crowd thickening as whispers rippled through the hall.


Within the gathering, Gianna watched with cold satisfaction, the corners of her mouth barely lifting in a smile.



Luck finally seemed to be tipping in her favor; she had spent the evening searching for a way to put Grace in her place.


"Grace Miller, how shameless can you get?Somebody saw you take it, yet you have the nerve to stand there and lie?" scolded one of Sonia's friends, her eyes narrowing.


"Is that so?" Grace answered, lifting a brow.



No doubt about it now-they had set her up from the start. The entire situation struck her as almost amusing. She could not wait to see just how far they would push this spectacle.



"Don't act so innocent. You practically stared a hole through that bracelet when you walked past. You must have wanted it badly,"Sonia's friend insisted, her voice thick with accusation.



A moment of silence followed as Grace took in the absurdity. The entire situation felt absurd. On what grounds did they level these accusations? Never once had she looked at Sonia's jewelry with any real interest. That lousy bracelet had no appeal to her!



"And before Sonia used the restroom, she tucked her bracelet into her purse. When she came back, it had vanished!" another girl chimed in, desperate to fan the flames.



"We even found an attendant who claims to have seen you pocket the bracelet. There's a witness now, and you're still acting innocent?" someone else added, piling on.


Amusement flickered in Grace's mind at the meticulousness of their little charade.Turning a keen eye to the attendant, she asked, "Did you really see me take the bracelet, or are you just repeating what you've been told?"


A nervous glance darted from the attendant,her words stammering out. "Y-Yes, I saw you do it...with my own eyes."

"Enough of this, Sonia! Let's get the authorities involved and end it now,"someone suggested, eager for a spectacle.



Within the crowd, Gianna's lips curled in barely concealed triumph-having the police involved was exactly what she wanted all along.



Grace's tone stayed even as she addressed everyone. "For the last time, I didn't steal anything. If you're so set on accusing me,then by all means, call the police. But listen carefully..."


She paused, letting her words settle. "If it turns out I'm innocent, I'll take every one of you to court for slander. You'll be apologizing to me in public, and I'll be expecting compensation."


For a heartbeat, the room hung in silence.


Even so, Sonia remained unfazed. "Fine by me.Call them."



Sirens wailed in the distance, and a team of police officers soon swept into the hall.
After a quick rundown of the situation, the officer in charge turned to the group. "Since the accounts differ, we'll need to search Miss Miller's belongings."


Unflinching,Grace handed her purse over,showing not a hint of fear.


As the zipper slid open, a hush fell over the crowd-a glittering diamond bracelet lay neatly inside her purse.


"That's mine!" Sonia burst out, seizing the bracelet and flashing a triumphant look at Grace. "You can't deny it now. What have you got to say for yourself?"


Grace's expression turned cold, yet a slight smile curved her lips. She had seen this trap coming from a mile away.


"I never laid a hand on that bracelet," she said coolly, casting a meaningful look at Sonia and Gianna. "But I do wonder how it found its way into my purse."
Suddenly, a commotion swept through the hall's entrance.






A tall figure in a sharply pressed uniform,shoulders decorated with an officer's insignia, strode in with an air of unmistakable authority.
###Chapter 30 Proving Her Innocence

"Sonia, what's going on?" the man asked in a low,commanding tone, his sharp eyes scanning the room.


Sonia immediately perked up, adopting a pitiful expression. "Chris! You came just in time. This woman stole my bracelet and was caught in the act!"


Grace arched an eyebrow when she heard this. No wonder the whole setup felt too perfect, and Sonia carried herself with such unwavering confidence. She had strong support behind her.


The high-ranking officer, Chris Mendoza, was Sonia's cousin and a sergeant stationed at the local police station.


is that so?" Chris asked, his presence radiating authority. His manner was always quick on the draw and no-nonsense; crossing him was a dangerous game.


The police officers instantly grew more serious when he entered the room.


Chris continued, "If that's the case, she must answer to the law."


He turned to the officers and ordered, "Take her in for Gianna felt a surge of satisfaction upon hearing those words. She couldn't help but wonder how Rodger and Julia would react when they discovered that their adopted daughter was a common thief. Grace might soon be cast out of the Holden family and possibly expelled from school as well.


The mere thought filled Gianna with joy. A scandal involving a Holden family member caught stealing would surely make headlines. And once that happened,Grace would no longer be a threat to her.


With a serious expression, a police officer turned to Grace and said, "Please come with us."


Grace lifted her eyes slightly, a subtle smile playing on her striking features. "You are taking me in without confirming the truth?"


"We are bringing you in for further investigation,"the officer responded calmly.


Grace remained composed. "Have you really thought this through? If I go with you, the consequences won't be so simple. Even if you beg me to leave later, l won't."


Sonia scowled. "Have you lost your mind? Do you think the police station is your private playground, where you clock in and out at will? You have stolen something worth over a million dollars. Get ready to spend some serious time behind bars!"


Finding the situation dull, Grace pressed her lips together, clearly uninterested in continuing the act.She picked up her phone and made a call.


Sonia sneered, "Not even a miracle can save you now.You might as well accept your fate."


But before long, several officers received calls asking whether they had arrested a woman named Grace Miller.



After truthfully reporting the situation, the officers were met with a fierce reprimand and ordered to release her at once.



Not wanting to waste another minute, Grace said, "I'm not a thief. Even if you handed me that diamond bracelet, I wouldn't want it, let alone steal it."


"Stop pretending. You are only saying that because you can't have it!" Sonia snapped, her face twisted with rage.


What kind of influence did Grace actually hold? Those calls a moment ago had come directly/ from the police chief, demanding her immediate release. Chris looked at Grace with a hint of confusion, noting how calm and collected she was.
"I can prove I never laid a finger on that bracelet,"Grace said firmly, her voice even and composed.


"Prove it? Do you actually think we'll buy that?" Sonia asked arrogantly. Confident in what she believed was irrefutable evidence, she was sure Grace would still end up in jail. So what if she had connections? Under the law, everyone was supposed to be treated equally.To most, Grace's phone call seemed like a desperate last resort.



Grace offered a calm, composed smile. "Give me the diamond bracelet."


Without hesitation, the police handed it over to her.


Grace took the bracelet and turned to the attendant."Did you personally see me take this bracelet?"


The attendant nodded without hesitation. "Yes, I saw it clear as day, just like you are holding it now."


Grace's expression turned serious. "Then I suggest you watch carefully this time."


She paused for a moment before slowly opening her hand.



Confusion spread through the crowd. Sonia scoffed,"Stop with the tricks. Just admit you stole it, and maybe I'll ask for leniency on your behalf."


Just then, Grace's delicate hand turned red, covered in nocence small,raised bumps.


Gasps rippled through the room. "What on earth is happening?"


Grace calmly handed the bracelet back to the police and explained, "The band of this diamond bracelet is made of platinum. I'm allergic to it. As you can see, just touching it triggers a reaction. These red bumps will take at least a day to heal. That means there's no way l could have taken her bracelet earlier. I I had touched it before,my hand would have already shown symptoms.You all saw the reaction start the moment I touched it."


Allergic to platinum? Could it really be that coincidental? Sonia's face twisted in disbelief. "No way! She must be faking it. This has to be some kind of trick!"


However, everyone had clearly seen what Grace had done. There was no chance she could have pulled any tricks.


Chris's brow furrowed as he turned toward Sonia,trying to ease the rising tension. "Sonia, is it possible you remembered things wrong?"


Sonia was momentarily speechless, her eyes unconsciously shifting toward the attendant.


Grace let out a cold laugh, then turned to the attendant, "Since you were so sure I took the bracelet,
explain exactly how you saw me do it. If you lie, I'l make sure you're taken straight to the station."


Panicking, the attendant suddenly blurted out, "I'll confess! Miss Richardson paid me fifty thousand to hide the bracelet in your purse..."
###Chapter 31 Crossing Paths Again
As soon as the attendant spoke, shocked whispers and startled gasps rippled through the crowd.


All color drained from Sonia's face. She leapt from her seat, jabbing her finger at the attendant and screaming, "What are you talking about? I've never even seen you before! How could I possibly be involved in something like this?"


In that instant, regret flooded her-she wished more than anything she could undo her choices. Everything had seemed airtight in her mind. The truth was, Grace had never actually wronged her; she simply couldn't stomach Grace's cool indifference. Worse yet, Grace's striking looks had effortlessly eclipsed her own.


Sonia had always reveled in being the one everyone watched. Ever since Grace arrived, though, the eyes that used to follow her had slowly gravitated toward Grace instead.


Gianna had told her that Grace was nothing but an orphan. Fueled by envy, she plotted to embarrass Grace publicly-determined to wipe that quiet pride from her face forever. However, things hadn't gone according to plan. Now, she was the one tangled in her own trap.
Hands shaking, the attendant fished out a bank card and passed it to the police, stammering, "This... this is what Miss Richardson gave me. You can see the transfer details for yourself..."


Accepting the card, the officer shǒt Sonia a hard,unforgiving look before addressing Grace. "Miss Miller,it appears this was a set-up against you. We'll get to the bottom of it."


Tears welled up as Sonia shook her head wildly, panic in her voice. "No, you've got it all wrong! Someone is framing me! Grace Miller-this is your doing, isn't it?You set me up!"


Grace merely regarded her with a calm, distant look,a faint, amused smile tugging at her lips. She saw no need to answer.


A deep frown etched itself onto Chris's face as disappointment clouded his gaze. "That's enough,Sonia."


Tears brimming in her reddened eyes, Sonia grabbed onto his sleeve, desperation cracking her voice. "Chris,you have to trust me-I swear I didn't do any of this..."


Shaking free from her grip,he met her plea with a cold glare. "You're still denying it, even with all the evidence laid out? Is this really how your family raised you?"


One of the officers stepped forward, voice sharp and unwavering. "Miss Richardson, you'll need to cooperate with the investigation. Know that making false accusations comes with legal consequences."


Color drained from Sonia's cheeks as true panic set in.Scrambling, she pulled out her phone, voice shaking. "I -I need to call my dad!"


A low, amused laugh escaped Grace as she turned to the officers. "I trust you'll handle this fairly. I have other matters to attend to, so l'll be on my way."


Without another glance back, she walked out,every step calm and unhurried. Lingering any longer in that suffocating room had no appeal for her. She also suspected this ordeal would finally teach Sonia a lesson.


Off to the side, Gianna watched the entire disaster play out, her fists clenched so tightly her knuckles turned white. She never imagined Grace would emerge from this completely untouched. How did things end up like this? Everything was supposed to go according to plan.Where had it all gone so wrong? Nothing about this outcome made sense to her. What were the odds that everything would line up this way? And how did Grace manage to keep her composure through it all?


Demi, lost in the crowd, found herself just as baffled.She'd hoped for the perfect opening to add her own twist to the drama, but the moment never arrived.

Rarely did she get invitations to gatherings like these,so she hadn't known the backstory or dynamics. When she witnessed everyone turning against Grace, a wave of relief had washed over her. However, luck was on Grace's side today-she slipped away from the chaos untouched. That outcome was nothing short of maddening.


Once Grace made her exit, Gianna wasted no time leaving the venue herself. She couldn't shake the worry that Grace might mention something at home and stir up more trouble.


No sooner had Grace walked through the door than Julia appeared, concern in her eyes."Grace, how did everything go?"


"Everything's fine," Grace answered, sidestepping any hint of trouble.


Julia's smile returned. "Wonderful. I'll make sure you get invited to more events like these-maybe you'll find some new friends along the way."


Grace was at a loss for words, realizing too late that she'd landed in an awkward situation. It was too late to express her dislike for these gatherings; everyone always seemed so hypocritical.


When Gianna saw that Grace hadn't mentioned what happened earlier, a wave of relief washed over her. The last thing she needed was for Rodger and Julia to discover Grace had been set up-and that she had stood by and done nothing One afternoon after classes ended, Grace rang home to say she'd be missing dinner, then flagged down a taxi headed for Ambrosia Dining.


Known for its refined setting and tasteful decor,Ambrosia Dining stood out among the city's most exclusive spots. Set in a prime part of town, the restaurant always drew admiring glances. Affluent people filled the tables each evening, all savoring the air of quiet luxury.


On this particular day, Patrick had arranged to meet Grace there for a conversation. She'd come prepared-not just for a talk, but with manuscripts and some of her newest pills to hand over to him.


Stepping out from the car, Grace made her way through the entrance and into the softly lit lobby.


Patrick was already waiting, settled in one of the private dining rooms.


Suddenly, someone called out in surprise, "Grace, what brings you here?"


A fant crease appeared on Grace's brow as she turned and spotted the entire Miller family nearby. Their formal attire suggested they were here for an important dinner engagement.


Grace could only marvel at the coincidence. Was the city really so small that their paths kept crossing?Every time, she wished for space, and every time, fate had other plans.


Avoiding conversation was her goal, but Demi had no intention of letting her slip by."What's the matter? Lost your voice all of a sudden?"


A cool look slid Demi's way. "Unless you own this place, I don't see why I'd need your permission to eat here."



A faint scowl tugged at lvy's lips. "You do realize a meal at this place will set you back at least ten grand?Are you even aware of that?"


Disdain practically dripped from her words.

###Chapter 32 Vivid Imagination

At first, the Miller family had believed Grace's life would improve once the Holden family took her in.However, since there had been no public announcement about the Holden family's adoption,coupled with the fact that Grace always seemed to be alone and rarely appeared with her new family,they concluded that she probably did not hold much importance in the household.



Seeing her now, dressed so plainly, Demi even thought Grace had been kicked out of the family.


Demi curled her lips into a sneer. "Grace, did youI come here for a job?"



"It's a shame you never pursued writing. You've got quite the flair for fiction," Grace shot back dryly, jibing Demi's delusions.



lvy joined in with a smirk."Wow, Grace. Things must really be going downhill for you."


She still hadn't let go of the $200, 000 that Grace had cost them.



Grace didn't bother arguing. She brushed past them without so much as a sideways glance, walking toward
the private dining rooms.


The silent treatment only made Demi more eager to provoke her. She raised her voice, loud enough for others to hear."Oh no, did the Holden family abandon you? Now, you're working as a waitress?"


lvy added mock pity to her voice, sighing loudly."Grace, if you truly need money, just ask. If you can't manage on your own and starve yourself, it reflects badly on all of us."


Luke said nothing, but his brows knitted slightly, a flicker of contempt flashing in his eyes.


"Thanks for the concern, but I'm doing just fine. Still, I suggest y/ou savor your meal today. You might not get to eat here again," Grace said with a knowing tone.


"What's that supposed to mean? Are you cursing us now? We won't be broke!" lvy snapped.


The thought of his company's recent setbacks made Luke's frown deepen.


Before the tension could rise further, the manager of the restaurant hurried over. He bent slightly at the waist and addressed Grace with utmost respect. "Miss Miller, Mr. Brown is waiting for you in the VIP room.Shall I take you there?"


Everyone from the Miller family froze.
The VIP room? It was typically reserved for the most prestigious guests. People even they couldn't easily rub shoulders with.



Demi's jaw dropped. "Wait-what? You must be mistaken I can't believe this. She..."



But the manager remained composed, his tone unwavering. "There's no mistake. Miss Miller is one of our honored guests."


Grace shot the family a calm, level look. "No need to escort me. I know the way."


Then she turned and walked off, every step confident and unhurried.


Fuming, Demi stamped her heel. "What the hell? How did she get into the VIP room?"


Ivy leaned in and whispered darkly to Luke, "She's definitely clinging to someone with power."


There was no way the Holden family would place this much importance on a girl they adopted.


Luke's expression turned thoughtful.







Inside the VIP room, Grace opened the door to find Patrick lounging by the window, swirling a glass of wine. Spotting her, he gave a crooked smile. "You're late. Did something come up?"


She rarely ran behind schedule. Something must've delayed her.


Grace set down a folder and a small.pill bottle on the table. Her voice was steady. "Just ran into the Millers.They're annoying, but harmless."


Patrick chuckled and poured another glass for her."Guess those fools still haven't learned their place."


Grace lifted the glass, her eyes glinting with frost."Eventually, they'll realize there are people you just don't mess with."



Patrick leaned forward, intrigued."Want me to step in?"





She gave a quick shake of her head."No thanks.I've got it under control."


He leaned back with a shrug."Suit yourself."


Picking up the small bottle from the table, he turned it over in his hand, visibly unimpressed. "Just one?Seriously?"



"If it's not enough, hand it back. I've got school to deal with. I don't exactly have spare time." Grace leaned into her chair, unconcerned.


"You still go to school? Isn't that a total waste for someone like you?" Patrick blinked.


Grace shot him a look and rolled her eyes. "You clearly don't get it. I have to go. I'm not about to disappoint my parents."


Patrick chuckled. "Fair enough. Anyway, remember the Pearson family I mentioned? Guess what. They raised their consultation price to a billion. You heard that right -one billion! So... what do you think? Are you in?"Patrick was so thrilled he could barely string a sentence together.


Grace took a slow sip of her wine, her tone unreadable."A billion, huh? They must be really desperate."


Patrick was practically bouncing in his seat. "Exactly!The head of the Pearson family's illness is so bizarre even the Master Healer gave up. Word is, only Dr. Q stands a chance at treating him. That's why they're willing to pay a fortune to get to you."


The Pearson family's head? Grace's mind drifted.Could it be the same man she rescued a few days ago?He was a Pearson. The toxin in his system was exceptionally rare, making it no surprise that Kevin had failed to treat it. Her fingers circled the rim of her glass as she mulled it over.


Noticing her zoning out, Patrick waved a hand in front of her face. "So? Are you taking it? It's a billion!"
Grace blinked and came back to the moment, the corners of her mouth lifting. "Sure. Why not?"


She couldn't let Kevin, her own protégé, have his reputation ruined.


Patrick lit up like a firecracker. "Awesome! I'll reach out to the Pearsons immediately."


"Great. I'll figure out a time that works," Grace replied calmly.


"Perfect," Patrick said with a grin.
###Chapter 33 A Damsel In Distress

As evening shadows lengthened, Grace emerged from Ambrosia Dining and stepped into the gentle glow of dusk.


A palm drifted to her softly swelling belly while she resolved to walk the rest of the way home,hoping it would help settle her meal.


She still savored the memory of dinner-Ambrosia's flawless ingredients and delicately crafted flavors had coaxed her into eating far more than she'd planned.


Meandering down the lively pedestrian street, Grace took her time, letting the world drift by.


Her pace slowed and then halted altogether when she turned onto a quieter lane.


Up ahead, she caught sight of Johnny, hemmed in by a rough-looking group of young men.


Behind Johnny, a timid woman clung to his shirt, her wide eyes brimming with fear and her skin almost ghostly in the streetlamp's dim glow.


The thugs,half-hidden in the shadows, looked all the more threatening with the faint light casting their faces in sharp relief.

"You'd better keep your nose out of this!" shouted the ringleader, voice low and threatening. "If you don't want trouble, walk away now, or you'll wish you had!"


Grace had every reason to ignore the scene. Still, the thought of Julia's inevitable worry måde her sigh-she couldn't just turn a blind eye. Setting her shoulders,she took a step forward to intervene.


Johnny faced Tony with stubborn resoIve. "Tony Reid,your reign of terror ends tonight. You're not pushing anyone around anymore," he said, voice unwavering.


A mocking laugh came from Tony, who motioned to his crew. "That's enough from you. Boys, teach him a lesson!"


Johnny did his best to defend himself, managing to fend off a couple of attackers, but the odds quickly overwhelmed him. Before long, bruises blossomed across his face, a testament to the one-sided brawl.


Drawing closer,Grace witnessed Johnny taking blow after blow from the gang.


Without so much as a second thought, she tossed her water bottle, and it smacked Tony right on the back of his head.


"Who the hell threw that?" A string of curses erupted from Tony as he spun around, clutching his skull.Spotting Grace, his expression shifted to one of predatory interest. A smirk crept onto his lips. "Well look what we have here. Why not join me for a little excitement,sweetheart?"


Johnny's eyes widened in shock at Grace's sudden appearance. "Grace! Why did you come? You need to leave right now!"


Grace paid him no mind, striding confidently over."Quiet down. Now, someone tell me what's happening here."


Before Johnny could speak, the frightened woman beside him choked out through her tears, saying "They-they forced me to go with them..."


Tony yelled from behind, "Your old man owes my boss five hundred grand! He said we could have you until the debt's paid. It's only fair!"


Horror flickered across the woman's face as she ducked behind Johnny for safety.


At that moment, Grace's gaze landed on the angry red marks circling the woman's wrists-a silent testament to her struggle. A cold edge crept into her tone as she faced Johnny. "Is she someone you know?"


Johnny straightened up, refusing to back down. "She's Beatrice Green-my classmate. Stay out of this, Grace.I've got this under control."
Tony cut them off with a wave of impatience."Enough chatter. Last chance-clear out, or you'll regret it just as much as he will!"


With steady confidence, Grace eased Johnny behind her and spoke in a low, even tone. "Walk away now, and I'll forget I ever saw you here."


For a split second, the thugs just stared, then their laughter rang out, mocking and loud.


Tony stepped up, flashing a crooked grin. "You've got a mouth on you. Guess I'll have to teach you a lesson-"


Grace didn't let him finish. She seized his wrist in one smooth motion and drove her foot into his shin.


A gasp tore from Tony as his legs gave out, sending him crashing to the pavement with a howl.


Not a single thug had time to blink before Grace darted through them, swift and silent as a shadow. Each move flowed into the next, and every hit landed exactly where she meant it to.


Ten seconds later, not one of the thugs was still standing-just a heap of bodies groaning in pain at her feet.


A single cold word left her lips."Out."


No one argued. The would-be tough guys scrambled upright and took off as fast as they could. mo Johnny could only stare, his jaw dropping in disbelief."How did you... Where'd you learn..."


He'd never seen anything like it. In his mind, Grace was gentle, always careful not to upset anyone.


Nobody could have imagined she'd handle herself in a fight. If he hadn't watched it happen, he would have sworn it was impossible.


A shrug was all Grace offered. "Turns out, I picked up a few tricks," she said, as if it were nothing special.


"Don't breathe a word of this to Mom," Johnny muttered,shifting awkwardly on his feet.


"Sure thing." Grace's gaze drifted over to Beatrice.Something about the woman set off quiet alarms in her mind. Pretty enough, but those restless eyes never once met hers.



"Th-thank you... really, thank you both..." Beatrice said,her hands wringing together, voice trembling. "If you hadn't shown up, l-I don't know what would've happened..."


Johnny tried to ease her worry. "You're safe now. I'lf see you home, don't worry."


Before moving off, he threw a look over his shoulder at Grace. "Go on ahead. And remember-keep this between us, don't bring it up to Mom or Dad."

With little more said, Johnny and Beatrice disappeared down the street.


Grace shrugged it off. After all, they were just classmates and it wasn't her problem.


Her walk home was quiet and uneventful.






Meanwhile, Dominick received an update from the underground market that left him stunned.


"Sir, there's wonderful news! Dr. Q has accepted the consultation request!" Dominick's words shook with barely contained excitement.


Colton could hardly hide his astonishment as the message sank in.


Hope had been all but lost when it came to Dr. Q.


His backup plan had been to seek out Grace,especially since just one of her pills had already started purging the toxins from his system.


With Dr. Q now agreeing to a meeting, the turn of events felt nothing short of miraculous.


Rumor had it, Dr. Q's acceptance was due to nothing more than a fleeting good mood and a free schedule.


Brilliant minds often came with their quirks.
ntrigue buzzed through Colton's thoughts-he found himself more eager than ever to uncover the true identity of this elusive genius.
###Chapter 34 Tension In The Air

Until now, nobody had ever left Colton with such a profound sense of helplessness. Yet, The Dr. Q managed just that.


Stories of her circulated like whispers-her presence always felt, yet her actual face never glimpsed,cementing her mythic status in the medical world.


Rumors were told of how, at just thirteen, she unraveled a neurological toxin mystery that had stumped experts for decades. By eighteen, she'd already chalked up three hundred surgeries, each one a marvel of complexity.


Patient selection depended solely on her mood, as she gravitated toward the rarest and most formidable medical puzzles.


No amount of money could sway her. For some, even vast sums meant nothing to her; she refused with a shrug.


Other times, she would waive her fees entirely, leaving both rich and poor baffled by her motives.


That she accepted Colton's case came as an unexpected twist, a stroke of fortune nobody could Still, the timeline would not be rushed-the treatment would begin only after she finished wrapping up exams at a certain high school.


Patrick continued to remind Colton of the importance of good rest. The upcoming procedures would be demanding and require every ounce of strength.


A respectful voice interrupted Colton's thoughts.


"Sir, the car is ready. We can leave whenever you wish," Dominick said.


A nod from Colton signaled his readiness. "Alright, let's head out." The plan for the day was set: he'd be joining his family at the estate for dinner.


His grandmother, Isabella Pearson, had called repeatedly, making sure the dinner was not to be missed.






Pearson Estate, the sprawling estate of the family, lay tucked away in Briskvale's most expensive district.


Iron gates eased open as Colton approached, and a chorus of servants called out,"Welcome home,sir!"


Colton barely offered a nod in reply. Sharp cheekbones and a severe jaw lent his face a striking edge, while his steely gaze radiated an almost intimidating chill.Every step he took seemed to ripple with authority,unsettling those nearby.


Long before he entered the living room, the unmistakable sound of ridicule floated through the air.


"Colton's a model in every respect-except for that little matter of being poisoned. Not much time left for him now. Why bother clinging to life with a body so broken?"


These cutting remarks belonged to his uncle, Harry Pearson, who spun a ruby ring on his finger, his suit immaculate.


A hush settled over the group at his words, but it quickly dissolved into sly laughter and whispered conversation.


"That's the truth. Everyone says only the elusive Dr. Q could fix a case like his, but who can say if such a person really exists? Colton's future is anybody's guess."


One more voice joined in, scoffing, "I still don't see how someone as fragile as him can run the company.Isn't that just asking for disaster? If he drops dead, the whole business goes with him!"


A steaming mug rested easily in Harry's hand as he sipped his coffee without a care.
Chatter drifted from the relatives flanking him, their words soaked with discontent and veiled complaints about Colton,


Contentment shone in Harry's expression; he was quite at home in this atmosphere.


As the second son, Harry always saw himself as a natural heir to the family fortune.


Pearson blood ran wide, but true leadership was in short supply among them.


Tradition dictated that the eldest, Clifford Pearson-Colton's father-should have assumed command after the old patriarch's passing.


But fate had intervened when Clifford's life was cut short by a fatal accident years ago.


Expectations shifted to Harry, who believed he would claim the seat at the head of the table, only for the old patriarch to pass the torch to Colton in his final hours.


Even Colton's poisoning did nothing to sway Isabella's faith; she insisted her grandson keep the reins, much to Harry's anger.


Suspicion colored every thought Harry had-he was certain Colton was behind the decisions, so their exchanges always dripped with biting remarks.


Colton pressed on without missing a beat, a frosty
smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth.


Dominick, trailing behind, bristled with indignation at the conversation, but a single warning glance from Colton kept him in place.


The moment Colton entered, his voice sliced through the room's false cheer. "Why the sudden silence?"


Silence swept through the living room in an instant.


No matter how they grumbled, not one person could ignore Colton's extraordinary skill in business. With astonishing speed, he had transformed Pearson Group,sending its market value soaring to three times what it once was.


Even illness did little to dull his edge-rivals still hesitated when facing him across a negotiation table.


Harry cradled his coffee and forced a pleasant grin."Back so soon, Colton? You caught us right in the middle of talking about you."


His tone gave no hint that he'd just been running Colton down seconds earlier.


A slow, deliberate sweep of Colton's eyes took in the room before coming to rest on his uncle. "Funny. You seem more preoccupied with my condition than l am."


That smile of Harry's faltered for a heartbeat, but he quickly masked it. "Family always comes first. I've even at most started reaching out to Dr. Q, hoping she'll agree to take your case."


Colton's reply was even and cool,every word weighted with subtle authority. "You seem to know quite a bit for someone on the sidelines."


He had no patience for more interference from Harry.


When Colton had set out to find Dr.Q, Harry had done everything possible to throw obstacles in his path.


A calculating glint flashed in Harry's eyes. "Be cautious. Dr. Q's reputation for being both hard to find and a bit unpredictable makes her a risky bet."


A hint of a smirk appeared on Colton's lips. "Your concern isn't needed. Though, word is your overseas venture has hit some rough waters. The board isn't pleased,I hear."


A flicker of panic crossed Harry'sfeatures, and he almost lost his grip on the delicate mug. Colton had a knack for hitting nerves right where they were exposed.


Tension crackled in the hall, thickening the air until it was almost hard to breathe.
###Chapter 35 Exams
Colton's eyes gleamed with a sharp chill that cut through the air like a blade. "If anyone here still has more to say, don't mind me. Keep going. Or I can step out until the whispering ends."


The tension in the room thickened as the pressure he radiated seemed to suffocate everyone at once. "Y-you've got it wrong. We didn't say a word."


The boldness they'd shown earlier had completely vanished. Each man was now silent, head lowered in guilt or fear.


Colton rested his fingers on the table, tapping rhythmically. Each sound landed like a warning shot,echoing through the heavy silence.


A crooked smile appeared on his face, cold and void of warmth. "You're getting on in years. Maybe it's time to stay home.Grandma enjoys peace. Let's not disrupt that unless absolutely necessary."


These were the same men who lined their pockets with dividends, only to whisper venom behind his back.


Not once had they been grateful to the source of their wealth.
As Colton spoke, their expressions soured, but none dared to argue.


Though he hadn't told them directly to leave, the message was painfully clear. Still, no one had the courage to push back.


After delivering his final jab, Colton turned and went to find Isabella.


"Grandma," he said softly.


"You scoundrel. Took you long enough to show your face," Isabella chided affectionately, her deep red dress highlighting the bright green of the emerald at her neck.


Even as she smiled, the thought that she might outlive her grandson cast a quiet shadow across her heart.


"l've been meaning to come. Things have just been hectic," Colton said, settling beside her.


"Hectic, always hectic. I'm not young anymore, Colton.All I want now is to see you happy, married, with children of your own," she said, exhaling a wistful breath.



"You're still in your prime. When I have kids, you'll be right here spoiling them." He laughed gently, not mentioning Dr. Q.


Some things were better kept secret, at least for now.
"I hope so. But how have you been feeling? You look much better." Isabella observed him closely, noting the healthy color in his face, and felt a quiet sense of relief.


"I'm doing fine, really. You don't need to worry."


"That's good to hear. Oh, and about Harry...I may be old and out of theloop, but if he crosses the line, you have every right to deal with him. Don't hold back on my account," she said knowingly, her insight still sharp despite rarely leaving the house.


" understand, Grandma. I know what to do,"Colton assured her with quiet confidence.







Before long, the day of exams at Briskvale High arrived.


It was Grace's first since changing schools, and Julia treated it like a milestone.


After breakfast, Julia gently pulled Grace aside and gave her a pep talk."Sweetheart, don't be nervous. No matter how it goes, you'll always be my precious girl."


Grace smiled calmly. "It'll be fine, Mom. I'm confident I'll do okay."


Johnny couldn't resist. "You sound pretty full of yourself.What if you flop? That would be awkward."


Julia narrowed her eyes at him. "Watch it. If your scores drop, you'll be hearing from me."


"Come on, Mom! I'm your real son. Don't I deserve a little more love?" Johnny whined,feigning heartbreak.


Obvious double standards once again-on full display.


"All I care about is seeing my darling girl happy." Julia chuckled, unbothered.


Across the table, Gianna had just set down her spoon,lips tightly sealed. Jealousy simmered just beneath her skin. Why was Julia so affectionate toward Grace?More so than she ever was with her.


Gianna's grip tightened on her backpack strap, her nails digging into the soft flesh of her palm.


Forcing a cheerful tone, she spoke up. "Aunt Julia, we should probably head out now. We'll be late for the exam."



Snapped from her moment of doting, Julia nodded and gently straightened Grace's collar. "Gianna's right. It's time. Do your best out there."


A sleek black Maybach glided out of the driveway without a hitch.


Inside, Johnny threw a sharp glance at Grace through the rearview mirror and snorted. "Let's just hope no one tarnishes the family's reputation."
Even though Grace had once stepped in to help him,he still couldn't bring himself to be grateful. He felt she had overstepped her bounds.


He had been eager to be Beatrice's knight in shining armor, but Grace had stolen the moment.


He had feelings for Beatrice, always had. And ever since that incident, she'd started showing signs of liking him back. Things between them were getting playfully romantic.


Meanwhile, Grace casually flipped through a worn-out notebook, her eyes never leaving the pages as she said, "Relax. I'm not scoring lower than you."


Johnny spun around so fast he nearly launched himself over the front seat.


Before things escalated, Gianna cut in, trying to keep the peace. "Johnny, Grace just joined us. It's already impressive she's managing so well..." Then her eyes caught the battered notebook in Grace's lap. "But Grace, that doesn't look like proper revision material.I could share my notes with you. They're all organized."


Grace finally raised her head, her voice as even as her gaze. "Thanks, but this is enough for me."


Inside the worn pages were names and sketches of rare herbs.

Grace had decided to use her spare time to plan a small medicinal garden.


Outside the exam center, the atmosphere buzzed with tension.





It was a series of major exams, and everyone was placed in random seats.


Most students fidgeted with nerves, but Grace stood quietly, unshaken.


Others misread her calm as defeat, assuming she had no expectations because she knew she'd end up at the bottom anyway.
###Chapter 36 Which Name Would Top The List

The sound of the bell filled the halls, marking the beginning of a test.


Students darted to their desks, eager to settle before the proctor arrived.


Grace found herself seated at the very front, directly beneath the sharp gaze of the proctor.


No one could say for certain if this arrangement was deliberate or just a coincidence.


Moments later, Ellie swept into the classroom, a stack of test papers pressed against her chest. Her eyes landed on Grace with a fleeting spark of contempt. She silently vowed to monitor Grace closely today,convinced she would catch her at something.


The math exam came first. As soon as the proctors handed out the tests, a chorus of shocked whispers rippled through the students.


The questions proved far more daunting than anyone had imagined.


Just scraping a passing score would feel like finding aThe List treasure chest.


Panic turned to resolve as pens hit the paper, every student racing against the clock.


In that same room, Gianna kept an eye on Grace, who sat a few seats away, perfectly in her line of sight.What struck Gianna was that Grace hadn't even picked up her pen.


A sly grin crept across Gianna's face. Just as she suspected, Grace had no clue how to begin, not even bothering to fake confidence.


Ellie and another proctor stood watch, but Ellie's focus rarely drifted from Grace.


She fully expected to catch Grace trying to pull off another unbelievable result.


Yet, not even half an hour had passed before Grace surprised everyone by setting down her pen and lifting her hand, signaling she was finished.


"What is it? You realize it's far too early to turn in your test," the proctor said, disapproving. Poor marks were one thing, but such a lackadaisical attitude was something else entirely.


Grace looked up with wide, innocent eyes. "I'm done."


"Take another look at your answers,"the proctor advised, still frowning. The room erupted with barely stifled laughter.


From her desk, Gianna almost let out a dramatic sigh.Who did Grace think she was fooling?


"No need for that," said Grace, swinging her backpack onto her shoulder and walking out without a second glance.


To the other students, she seemed like a lost cause.Watching her hand in her paper so early brought everyone a strange sense of comfort; surely she'd rank lowest in the class.


Ellie retrieved Grace's exam, scanning the pages in disbelief. Every answer box had something filled in, but she doubted any were right. Clearly, this was nothing more than an act.


For the following two days, Grace was always the first to turn in her exams, never once hesitating.


Once the last test ended, students let out a collective breath, though a current of anxiety lingered about the results.


To keep things above board, teachers gathered to grade the tests together, shuffing the papers so names remained hidden.


Sipping from her cup, Ellie tried to sound humble. "I'm curious how our students did this time. I've heard some weren't too sure about their performance."


A teacher from Class B chimed in, "Ellie, let's be honest, your students always come out on top. I'm willing to bet the highest score this round is from your class again."


With a practiced modesty, Ellie replied, "You're too kind."





Another teacher joined in, teasing, "The rest of us can only watch as you collect another bonus,Ellie."


Fred, seated nearby, received a consoling pat on the back from the neighboring teacher. "Don't feel too down, Fred. People understand your class has its challenges. It can't turn out too badly."


Pushing his glasses higher, Fred replied, "Thanks,but trust my students will surprise us."


A silent scoff rose in Ellie's thoughts. Soon enough,she believed, Fred's faith would be dashed. With Grace pulling the scores down, she expected her own class to widen the lead.



Eventually, the teachers finished grading and gathered in the office for a bit of banter.


"You wouldn't believe what I found-a paper with every answer correct, even the open-ended ones matched perfectly. It honestly gave me chills!" one teacher exclaimed.


Another chimed in, "I saw an essay so good I had to give full marks. That's a first for me. There was nothing I could deduct-just flawless writing!"


"I graded a math exam with a perfect score.Considering how tough those questions were, it felt unreal-whoever did that is a genius!"


Another teacher spoke up next. "Same story here-a perfect score across the board."


"Are you guys serious?" Ellie's curiosity piqued.


"Absolutely, Ellie. It must be Gianna White in your class,right? She's gifted in every subject, especially when it comes to essays. No one else could pull this off,"suggested a teacher.


Ellie tried to keep her expectations in check. "Who knows? Maybe there's a dark horse," she said, not realizing her words would soon ring true.


A small, secret smile flickered on her lips. Deep down,she felt certain Gianna had done it again, though she tried not to gloat.


Suddenly, the dean strode in, clapping for attention. everyone here? Good! The exam results are ready. You can check your class's scores now."

 
Optimism shone in the dean's smile, hinting at strong List results.


"One more thing. Prof. Terry Warren from Summit University will be coming to teach a special course.The student who impresses the most will get a shot at the coveted recommendation," the dean announced.


A confident smile spread across Ellie's face the moment she heard the news. In her mind, Gianna had all but claimed the top honors already. Gianna's track record spoke for itself-her foundation was rock-solid,and it seemed impossible for anyone to outperform her. Meanwhile, Grace was another story. If she landed at the bottom, Ellie doubted she would have the nerve to stay.


As soon as the dean exited, teachers hurried to their computers, nerves buzzing.


With hearts racing, everyone dove into the results,eager to discover how their students had performed,and most of all, which name would top the list.
###Chapter 37 Perfect Scores
Ellie observed as her colleagues gathered around their computers, eager to see how their classes performed,while she remained composed, confident that the honors students would lead the pack.

Once most of the teachers had finished reviewing the results, a wave of mixed emotions swept through the room-some faces lit up with pride, others sagged in quiet disappointment.

One teacher leaned in and asked, "Ellie, have you checked the honors class yet?"

"I'm about to," said Ellie. She logged into the grading portal and scanned through the exam data. The numbers were not impressive. However, knowing how challenging the test was, she found the results reasonable.


Each subject's average hovered at a respectable level,even if it dipped below what her class usually achieved.


Ellie's eyes traced the list of scores, and she pressed her lips together in concern.


Suddenly, the teacher beside her gasped. "Wait, am I seeing this correctly? Someone check-who's leading Another teacher replied, "There's no suspense. Gianna White must have taken the top spot again."


"Of course, who else could it be?"


"No, really, come check for yourselves. Maybe I need new glasses," the teacher said, voice shaky.


Heads swiveled towards the computer, and another teacher blurted out, "It's Grace Miller. Look!"


A hush swept through the office as every gazelocked onto the glowing screen.


"Grace Miller? Are we talking about the same Grace who was accused of cheating?" Elliemuttered,adjusting her glasses and hurrying over.


The truth was there, bold and undeniable.


Grace had achieved a flawless score in every subject.


Ellie stood in shock, rooted to the spot, while disbelief painted itself across every face in the room.


"I... I must be seeing things," a teacher blurted out,voice unsteady. "Grace Miller transferred in halfway through the year, right? Everyone said she struggled to keep up and her grades were always at the bottom.What is happening here?"


Defeat seemed to wash over Ellie as she listened. Impossible! It made no sense that Grace could be this extraordinary.


A sudden thought flashed through her mind. Her tone sharpened. "Pull up Grace's answer sheets on the projector."


The room turned silent as the answer sheets appeared on the big screen.


Grace's math responses looked flawless. Each step was laid out clearly, her solutions neat and to the point.For the last, trickiest problem, she even included two separate ways to solve it.


Switching to the language section, her essay read with an effortless flow, her word choice sharp and authentic.



What really stunned them was the essay's depth. It was filled with thoughtful insights and references,making it seem painstakingly written, not just dashed off in the heat of the moment.


Ellie watched, fingers trembling as she took in every word and number.


A math teacher leaned closer to the display. "Hold on,everyone, check out her approach on this last problem."


He pointed to the screen and said, "She used a technique from advanced college mathematics.

There's no way that's in our curriculum!"


Chaos broke out in the office.


"Where could she have learned that?".


"Did she start studying college material on her own?"


Ellie thought back to Grace's transfer from a small school, where she had always ranked near the bottom.How could someone change so dramatically, so quickly?


"None of this makes sense.." Ellie muttered. "She must have found a way to cheat."


Yet she had watched Grace from start to finish,knowing for certain that cheating had not occurred.


Ellie had seen her write every answer.


No other student managed a perfect score. Only Grace reached the highest mark in the entire school.


The result opened the door for early university admission.


As the reality sank in, Ellie felt a sharp sting of disappointment pierce her pride.


The idea that Grace, once overlooked and underestimated, had surpassed her most promising students, left Ellie humiliated.
The exams ended, and the school quickly rolled into a three-day break.


Grace let Patrick know that he should arrange Mr.Pearson's treatment for two days from now, since her own schedule was packed for the next couple of days.


Fresh off a brief getaway, Ethel arrived home with her milestone birthday drawing near.


Julia had her hands fulI making plans, determined to make Ethel's eightieth birthday something memorable for everyone.


Now that Ethel was back, Gianna wasted no time settling in at her place. Nobody protested her decision.


Stepping into the room, Gianna hurried over, wrapping her arm around Ethel's with affection. "Grandma,you're finally home! The trip must have worn you out.How about I work out the tension in your shoulders?"


Her hands moved expertly as she started massaging Ethel, who returned the gesture by patting her hand with fondness.


A smile brightened Ethel's face. "You always know how to look after me, Gianna. No one is as thoughtful as you are."


Her expression shifted when her eyes landed on Grace,Grace had offered a polite greeting upon arrival, but made no move to please Ethel, remaining stiff and silent.


Ethel called out, her tone turning chilly, "Julia, Grace has a lot to learn about proper behavior. Our family sets high standards, and we must hold fast to them, or people will mock us."


She looked straight at Grace. "It's not surprising,considering she grew up in an orphanage. She'll have to pick up everything from the very beginning."


Julia's brow furrowed. "Grace is making progress.She's putting in the effort, both with her studies and her manners."


"Making progress? I heard the exams just finished.Why not check her results and see for ourselves?"Ethel's tone was dismissive.


Gianna cast a smug glance at Grace, her eyes gleaming with satisfaction. There was no doubt in her mind. Grace had likely stumbled on the exams.Everyone in the Holden family was expected to excel.For Grace, it looked like her time was almost up.
###Chapter 38 Birthday Gifts
Ethel's eightieth birthday celebration unfolded at her beloved home.



She had never been one for grand venues, always favoring the quiet grace of her familiar surroundings.


Knowing this well, Rodger arranged for the estate to be spruced up ahead of time. Every corner still held its refined beauty, but now cheerful touches marked the place with a sense of festivity.


Invitations had gone out early, sent to friends and relativeS.


Ethel's eldest son, Carl, and her young daughter,Eliana, all returned home for the celebration.


When her birthday arrived, brilliant decorations dressed the estate in color.


A welcoming line of staff waited at the front, each ready to greet guests with practiced smiles.


By noon, arrivals filled the hall, each person carrying gifts chosen with care.


Some guests brought original paintings by celebrated artists. Others brought health supplements, while a few gave striking pieces of jewelry.


A parade of luxury vehicles crowded the driveway.Laughter and well-wishes floated in the air, weaving a scene of warmth and joy.


Draped in a deep red gown, Ethel radiated both warmth and elegance. Not a strand was out of place as her silver hair sat perfectly coiled in a bun, and she reclined in the grand armchair, a gentle smile lighting up her face.


Even with the years behind her, her spirit shone bright -her posture was regal, her eyes sharp, and she carried herself with the grace and authority of a true matriarch, drawing admiration wherever she turned.


"Happy birthday, Ethel!"


"Wishing you a wonderful birthday!"


Friends and relatives approached in turn, offering their heartfelt greetings. Ethel responded to each with warmth and gratitude.


Meanwhile, Carl and Rodger moved through the crowd,playing the role of hosts. Eliana settled in beside Ethel,enjoying a quiet chat.


When gift-giving began, Gianna stepped up quickly determined not to be left out. Her voice rang out,saying, "Grandma, happy birthday! I wish you all the happiness and good health in the world. I picked something truly special for you. Hope you like it."


She then brought forward an elegant velvet box,opening it with deliberate care.


Nestled inside was a delicate ruby necklace.


Leaning in, Gianna added softly, "I've always heard that rubies symbolize luck and protection, which makes them truly special. I chose this ruby necklace with you in mind, hoping that it would bring you comfort and joy in your life."


Ethel traced the ruby with gentle hands, her eyes lighting up as she nodded in approval. "You're a thoughtful child, Gianna. The necklace is pretty. I really do love it."


A broad grin spread across Gianna's face. "It makes me so happy that you love it," she replied, pride lighting up her eyes.


Her attention drifted to Grace, wondering what she could possibly bring to the table.


Admiration echoed through the guests gathered nearby.




"What an extraordinary piece!"


"Miss White is so kind!" "Ethel is so fortunate to have such devoted family!



Ethel's smile stretched wider, her happiness genuine and unmistakable.




Casting a sideways glance at Grace, Gianna spotted the simple cloth bag in her hands. She raised her voice just enough to draw attention. "Grace, what did you prepare for Grandma?"


Beneath her sweet tone, her thoughts twisted. Surely,Grace would embarrass herself-what expensive gift could Grace possibly afford? She almost wanted to laugh.


Others in the room began to turn their attention to the quiet girl.




Word had spread that Grace, adopted by Rodger and Julia, had grown up in an orphanage.


Grace was undeniably attractive and carried herself with a cool, almost distant poise. Yet onlook<ers couldn't help but question what she might offer that would be fit for such an occasion.


Grace and Ethel never shared an easy relationship.Ethel always seemed to see her as an outsider.Seeing Grace approach with that plain bag only deepened her frown. Did this simple girl even understand the kind of company she was in, or the standards expected here?Who walked into a birthday banquet with something like that? So much for Julia's talk about her being well-mannered.





The crowd exchanged knowing glances, their whispers rising in volume.





Through it all, Grace remained calm, her face an unreadable mask as the stares and quiet jabs rolled off her.


With a gentle smile, Julia nudged her forward."Go ahead, Grace, give Grandma your gift."


Not even Julia knew what Grace had brought, but she understood it was given in kindness.



A quiet nod from Grace signaled her readiness, and she stepped up to Ethel.


Amusement danced on Gianna's lips, eager for the show she thought would unfold.


"Grandma," Grace said, her tone unwavering and clear,"I wish you the happiest of birthdays."


She carefully loosened the ties on her simple bag and lifted out a plain wooden box for all to see.


An immediate wave of surprise swept through the crowd. Was that really her gift?


Ethel's patience wore thin, her mind racing with annoyance. What was this nonsense? Did Grace think a box like that belonged here?


"Grace, is that it? Did you really just bring Grandma a wooden box?" Gianna questioned, pretending to be baffled.


From every angle, it looked to be nothing more than that-a nondescript, ordinary container.


"Why jump to conclusions?" Grace answered softly,her poise unshaken. With one swift motion, she flipped the lid open.


Nestled inside, a bracelet made of polished wooden beads shimmered in the light.


Gianna couldn't stifle her laughter. So this was it-she had been bracing for something remarkable, only to find a humble string of beads.


Disappointment twisted Ethel's mouth. She could barely bring herself to glance at the offering.


A wooden bracelet? How could this girl stand there and offer something so plain and pitiful? It was embarrassing, truly.


"Grace, you always know how to surprise us," Gianna said,her laugh tinged with ridicule.


Grace offered no explanation, her expression enigmatic. As far as she was concerned, fools deserved no answer at all.
###Chapter 39 Grace's Gift


"Is that what I think it is?" One guest's eyes widened as she blurted out, "Is that made of Hipolis agarwood?"


"Hipolis agarwood? Are you serious?" People started whispering in disbelief, then their voices rose.


People leaned in, drawn by a scent that seemed to wrap the whole room in its embrace.


Leaning in closer, Grace explained in a gentle tone,"This bracelet was made from agarwood in Hipolis, and rumor has it the wood is over three centuries old. The scent takes generations to mature, and these beads were crafted from the very best."


"Weren't those bracelets made for royalty? Only three sets ever existed, if the stories are true! How could such a relic end up here? This is incredible. Money can't buy something like this," someone stammered,their voice trembling.


The wonder in that voice filled the room. Anyone who understood the legend knew that owning such a bracelet was beyond what wealth alone could bring.


Ethel's breath caught as the meaning behind the present sank in. Her hands trembled a little as she received the bracelet, noticing tiny, elegant inscriptions carved into every bead.


Emotion swept over her, and she breathed out, true. Memories flood back to me now; my father always longed for this treasure. He once told me, if only he could have this with him, he'd leave this world without a single regret."


Whispers of excitement moved through the crowd, the atmosphere alive with wonder.


Gianna's face turned pale, tension twisting through her fingers. The thought of Grace presenting such a priceless gift had never crossed her mind.


Rodger and Julia were left speechless. The price alone was unimaginable, but its rarity made its appearance almost unbelievable. How in the world did Grace manage to acquire it?


Drawn by curiosity, everyone in the room circled around, eager to take a closer look at each bead's flawless surface.


Gently turning the beads over in her palm, Ethel admired the subtle, golden warmth radiating from each one. Its value was impossible to put into words.


She fixed her gaze on Grace, eyes swirling with mixed feelings. "How did you come across something sO rare?"


A peaceful smile played on Grace's lips. "It all happened by chance. A treasure like this only finds meaning with someone like you."


Ethel cradled the precious bracelet in her hands,handlingit with unmistakable reverence.


Moments later, the crowd began presenting their gifts,filling the air with laughter and music once more.


Simmering beneath her poised exterior, Gianna could barely contain her frustration.


She had been so sure her own gift would steal the show. Her bank account had paid the price,all for this moment of recognition.


Yet Grace had managed to eclipse her effort completely. The truth was obvious-nothing could compare to the legendary bracelet.


Humiliation burned inside Gianna, impossible to ignore.Scanning the room, she caught Eliana's eyes fixed on her, an amused sparkle dancing in Eliana's expression.


Gianna's breath caught in her chest. She quickly arranged her face into a smile. "Aunt Eliana, is there something on your mind?"


Gliding closer with her glass, Eliana twirled her wine thoughtfully before lowering her voice. "What's the matter? Already letting jealousy get the better of you?"

Gianna pressed her hands together, feeling her fingernails bite into her palms."No,I just-"


A quick glance from Eliana landed on Grace, now surrounded by admirers. "Rumor has it Mrs. Pearson offered an outrageous sum for Hipolis agarwood and walked away empty-handed. Yet Grace managed to get her hands on it."


A shrewd light sparked in Gianna's eyes. "You don't think-"





Taking a measured sip, Eliana kept her face unreadable. "She grew up in an orphanage. How could she possibly have access to something so rare?"


"That's what I've been wondering. Maybe she knows someone influential, or maybe there's more to her story. Why else would she join the Holden family at this time? Maybe she's hiding something."


By planting these doubts in Eliana's mind, Gianna hoped to draw her to her side and make Grace's life a living storm.


Behind her composed exterior, Eliana seethed.


She struggled to accept the reality-while she had been away, Rodger had brought home a daughter.To her, it felt like utter madness. Grace, already eighteen and a mystery, could only be interested in the family's wealth.
Just imagining someone else eyeing the inheritance sent a fresh wave of anger through Eliana. She had already made up her mind-Grace needed to disappear from their lives.



After the festivities for Ethel's birthday, Eliana resolved to extend her stay, determined to get to the bottom of Grace's sudden arrival.


By next morning, the house throbbed with activity Both Carl's and Rodger's families lingered under one roof, turning the place into a hive of chatter.


Descending the stairs, Grace spotted Eliana standing with her back turned.


For someone approaching forty, Eliana still managed to look strikingly fresh-faced, her features echoing Ethel's grace and refinement.


As Grace drew closer, she caught Eliana's words to Julia. "Julia, forgive my directness, but that girl you brought home? Word is she bounced through four different families at the orphanage, and she never even managed decent marks. Tell me, why on earth would you and Rodger take her in?"


The scorn in Eliana's voice was impossible to miss.


Julia, who had never shared any warmth with Eliana,grew visibly irritated.
Her own history complicated things-Julia had no known relatives and her past remained murky thanks to long-buried memories. Rodger had welcomed her into his life without ever uncovering where she came from.


Ethel's initial disapproval had been štrong, especially since she had already chosen a bride for Rodger-one he rejected for Julia.



Ever since learning about Julia's uncertain background,Eliana viewed her with thinly veiled contempt.


Now, with Grace in the picture, Eliana seemed eager to stir up trouble.


Julia's lips thinned as she retorted, "Grace is sharp and well-versed in so many things. She even has the skill to heal people!" Clearly, Eliana's only fear was sharing the family fortune with Grace.
###Chapter 40 Advanced Stomach Cancer

Julia nearly sneered. In her view, Eliana clearly forgot whose sacrifices had built the Holden name into something worth fighting over. The nerve of these people, daring to cast suspicion on her daughter, left Julia burning with indignation.


A smirk played across Eliana's lips. "So she's a miracle doctor now, is she?"


Gianna jumped in, eager to add, "I heard Grace even made special pills for Aunt Julia. She said they can treat all kinds of sickness."


"What? She's out there making medicine? Where's her license? Julia, you must be out of your mind to believe her crap!" Eliana exclaimed, her expression one of disbelief.


"Aunt Julia, taking random pills is reckless.Who knows what might happen if things go sideways? And honestly, we don't much about Grace's past," Claire Robertson, chimed in, ever eager to back up her mother Eliana. Her words hung heavy in the room.


Rodger's patience snapped. His voice cut through the tension. "Claire, you're speaking out of turn. Grace is family, and you'll treat her as such."


In a flash, Eliana attempted to patch things up."Rodger, you know Claire means well. She's just looking out for you guys. You should be more cautious with anything Grace gives you."


"There's no need to worry. Since I started taking those pills, my energy returned, my skin glowed, and I've been sleeping like a baby. The doctor said my health is perfect, so there's no reason for concern," Julia said,her face lit with confidence.


A deepening frown crept across Eliana's face. The sight of both Rodger and Julia swayed by Grace left her stunned.


This situation, if unchecked, might one day see Rodger's fortune slipping right into Grace's grasp.


At the staircase landing, Grace paused, her delicate fingers curling around the banister.


She dropped her gaze, masking a brief, cold glint in her eyes.


"Aunt Eliana," she called out, breaking the uneasy silence.


Eliana turned around, her gaze landing on Grace.


Dressed in a plain white shirt and a pair of jeans, Grace looked serene. Her skin held a ddelicate glow, and her  steady eyes gave away nothing of her thoughts.


"| may not know everything, but I do know what courtesy looks like. It's one thing to speak freely with your own family, but out in the world, people would just call it bad manners," said Grace, a faint smile tugging at her lips.


A flush crept up Clair's cheeks. "How dare you!"


With a quiet step closer, Grace lowered her voice."Claire, have restless nights been haunting you? Do you often wake,startled,long before dawn?"


Fear flickered in Claire's eyes. "How do you know that?"





"Those circles beneath your eyes hint at exhaustion,maybe even something deeper," Grace explained,easing back and letting her voice carry across the room. "Would you like to try my calming pills? I promise they'll help you feel better."


Without hesitation, Eliana yanked Claire away. "Enough with these games!"


One quick glance at Eliana, Grace's gaze grew serious."You're not well."


Anger surged through Eliana. "If anyone's sick, it's you!"





Her hand shot up, intent on striking, but Grace's reflexes proved faster, her grip firm on Eliana's wrist.


Surprise overtook Eliana as she struggled, unable to break free from Grace's hold.


In that tense moment, Grace spoke with unnerving calm. "I wish I was wrong, but it's advanced stomach cancer. If you wait any longer, there won't be much anyone can do."


Eliana froze, her face ashen. "You-you're lying! I'll make you regret this!"


Fear sent Claire stumbling forward, yelling, "Stop it!Don't say such things about my mom!"


Letting go of Eliana's wrist, Grace kept her voice steady. "Aunt Eliana, I'd like to ask-have you noticed more frequent stomach aches, a fading appetite, or perhaps you're losing weight without trying? Do you ever feel sick or vomit after eating, even small meals?"


Eliana's eyes narrowed, her lips quivering. Those symptoms had been troubling her for weeks, but she'd written them off as nothing more than a mild case of gastritis.


Still, every word from Grace lined up perfectly with her complaints.





A look of concern crossed Rodger's face. "Grace,that's a serious accusation. You can't make such claims on a whim."


Eyes steady, Grace responded, "Dad, I'm not making wild claims. If you have doubts, let Aunt Eliana get a gastroscopy. The results will tell the truth."


Julia's nerves were on edge. "Eliana, why not get checked right away? It's better to be safe than sorry."


Ordinarily, Julia would never side with Eliana, but some situations called for setting aside grudges.


Forcing a dismissive laugh, Eliana replied, "Pretending you know everything! I feel just fine, so don't waste your breath."


Claire added, "Exactly, Mom! Let's not waste any more time. She's only trying to scare you!"


Their retreat had almost reached the door when Grace's voice cut through the air. "One month."


Eliana hesitated mid-step.


Unflinching, Grace watched her go. "If you don't get checked within a month, not even a miracle will pull you back. The cancer has already started its work,but treatment is still possible. Refuse, and you'll be signing your own fate."


Frozen with shock, Eliana refused to look back,dragging Claire with her as she hurried away.
Silence settled, and Rodger studied Grace with unease. "Grace, is there any chance you're mistaken?"


Grace gave a small, resolute nod. "Dad, I never make light of matters like this. Please try to convince her."


Grace's concern had always come from loyalty to her parents. Anyone else's trouble meant little to her.


Julia was worried. "What if Eliana refuses to get checked?"




Lowering her eyes, Grace replied quietly, "If she turns her back on her own life, we can't help her. No one can."


After a pause, Rodger let out a weary sigh. "I'll do my best to change her mind."


Grace simply nodded.


For her, giving the warning was enough. Eliana's future now rested in her own hands.
###Chapter 41 Dr.Q Was Grace Miller
After finishing her breakfast, Grace began preparing for the day ahead.


She had an appointment lined up-a medical consultation for someone in the Pearson family.


Relying on no one but herself, she hailed a cab for the journey rather than accept any offer from the Pearsons for a driver. The last thing she ever wanted was a fuss or a dramatic arrival.


Rumors swirled that today's patient was someone of considerable importance, which explained all the secrecy surrounding the visit.


Even the Pearsons had set aside an entire medical wing for the occasion.


Colton had insisted that no one find out about Dr. private visit. If his uncle discovered the arrangement,complications would surely follow.


Relying on the address Patrick had texted her, Grace rode straight to the estate, avoiding all fuss.


A cap shadowed her eyes as she strode toward the main gates, every step light and unhurried.
Just outside, Dominick lingered, fidgeting as he kept watch for a mysterious arrival.


Before long, a young woman in a crisp white T-shirt and simple jeans crossed his line of sight.


Long, slender legs carried her with a quiet confidence,her movements graceful yet nearly silent on the pavement.


"Miss Miller?" Dominick called out, momentarily caught off guard by her presence. Today, of all days, wasn't ideal for random visitors.



"We should go inside," Grace replied, her tone cool and businesslike.


Dominick hesitated, uncertainty creeping into his voice. "I apologize, but I'm actually expecting someone else. You're here for Mr. Pearson, right? He may not be available this morning..."


Dominick's gaze kept darting down the driveway, still searching for the legendary doctor.


Frustration threatened as he recalled insisting on personally escorting the enigmatic doctor, only to be politely turned down.


Double-checking her phone, Grace frowned, glancing at the estate behind him. "This is the Pearsons' estate,isn't it?"


Did Patrick send her the wrong address?


"Yes, that's right," Dominick answered, a bit more formal now.





"I'm here for Mr. Pearson's treatment. Please, show me the way," she said without a hint of doubt.


"Wait! You-you're Dr. Q?" Dominick stammered, shock flickering across his face. In a scramble, he nearly lost his glasses, fumbling to steady them, his nerves completely unraveled.


Everything he'd pictured about Dr. Q-someone older,perhaps with a commanding presence-seemed utterly wrong now.


No part of him wanted to believe that this unassuming young woman could be the famed healer he'd heard so much about.


Despite witnessing Grace work her magic before, he still found it hard to equate her with the famed Dr. Q.


Questions hung on his tongue, but Grace had no patience for explanations. Instead, a small nod was all she gave as she reached into her canvas bag and produced a wooden token.


Elegant carvings covered the surface, and a boldcaught the light in the center, unmistakable and proud.


Dominick's breath hitched. There was no mistaking it-

the token was genuine.

"Please forgive me! I truly did not mean it!" Dominick bent low at the waist, cheeks flushed as a nervous sweat began trickling from his hairline. "Dr. Q, right this way. Mr.Pearson has been waiting for you."


They walked together down the corridor, their footsteps echoing until they reached a small,separate building on the western edge of the grounds. This was the private medical facility reserved for Colton.


Dominick had only just lifted his hand to knock when the door swung open from inside.


Inside the room, several figures waited-the leading specialists from the top hospitals-engaged in a serious debate, every face shadowed by worry.


"With Mr. Pearson's state, I believe we should avoid risky procedures and proceed with caution," said one of the doctors.


"That is not enough. Surgery gives him his only real hope. The toxins are aIready moving through his body,"another doctor insisted.


A calm and unmistakable voice rang out from the entrance. "Seems like every one of you is ready to write him off."


Heads turned at once, startled by the interruption.

Dominick was no longer alone. A young woman stood at his side.





All around, doctors furrowed their brows in confusion.Who was she, and what was she doing here?


Rodney Powell, one of the more senior doctors, glared in disapproval. "Who let her in? This is no place for childish nonsense. Get her out of here-immediately."


Frustration echoed through the group as the other doctors voiced their complaints. The mounting tension in the room made it clear that they had little patience left for unexpected guests.


"Mr. Byrd, escort her out. We're discussing a matter of life and death here."


With a careful step forward, Dominick's voice carried both caution and resolve. "Doctors, please. This is Dr.Q, the very specialist Mr. Pearson asked to see."


An immediate hush fell over everyone.


Dr. Q? This young woman? Surely, someone must be playing a trick.





Rodney's face tightened with open disbelief, his annoyance growing. "You can't expect us to take this seriously. Does she even have a license? We're surrounded by enough imposters already."


"That's right. You have got to be joking. People these days will try anything for money-even trying to con Mr.Pearson? She must be out of her mind."


"Years of training make a real doctor. What could she possibly know at her age?" another physician scoffed.


A ripple of mocking laughter and pointed glances spread through the group.


Grace's lips twitched with a sly confidence. "Suppose I manage to pull him through-what will you say then?"


A doctor let out a harsh laugh. "You? Heal Mr.Pearson?Don't make us laugh."


"If you pull that off, I'll believe in miracles-or that pigs might fly."


With a cool nod, Grace replied, "Then we're in for an extraordinary spectacle."


At that very moment, a familiar face appeared at the door. It was Colton in his usual relaxed clothes.


His gaze turned cold the second he spotted Grace in the room.


He had wondered if it might be her, but coming face-to-face with Grace left him shaken.


So it was true-Dr. Q was Grace Miller.


They locked eyes-hers calm and full of resolve, his unreadable and intense.
Though his features looked tired, the powerful aura he carried had not faded in the least.


Turned out he was her patient.
###Chapter 42 Detoxification

Grace's instincts had whispered to her from the start when she accepted the challenge.


"Mr. Pearson." She gave a small nod, addressing him directly."We can start your treatment now."


"These are the most recent lab results and reports,"Dominick said.


Brushing the papers aside, Grace replied, "I won't be needing those. They're as useful as a broken clock."


Such tests,to her mind, were pointless.


Diagnosis came as easily as breathing for her.


Rodney's pride stung, so he tried to intervene. "Mr.Pearson, you shouldn't listen to this woman. She's not who she claims to be."


Unmoved, Colton cast a flat stare at Rodney. "I trust her."


Eyes narrowing, Grace met Rodney's gaze. "If your knowledge falls short, it doesn't mean everyone's does."


Another physician, nerves frayed, asked her with a raised voice, "Do you realize who you're speaking to?
Dr. Powell's reputation reaches every corner of the country."




"Does it really? If that's true, why is Mr. Pearson still suffering? Seems pretty shameful, if you ask me,"Grace replied flatly.


Frustration made the doctor's words come out sharp."You think you're so clever. Let's see what miracle cure you think you've got."


Every approach they had tried had already failed.


Even the so-called "Master Healer" had surrendered to the situation. Yet here this young lady stood, speaking as if the outcome were already certain. It took nerve to stand against them all.


"Wait and watch. The answer will come soon enough,"Grace replied calmly.


Rodney's patience snapped. "So this is the famous healer? She's probably just a fake who got lucky once or twice."


One of the other doctors attempted to ease the tension. "Let's give her a chance. If she fails, she won't make it out of here by morning."


Turning her attention away from the chatter, Grace addressed Colton. "We can begin now."


Colton moved aside, catching Dominick's eye with a mvlle nod.


Without needing further instruction, Dominick sprang into action, handling the preparations smoothly.


Interest kept the other doctors rooted in place, eager to witness Grace's methods. Many of them doubted her. Some even waited for Colton to throw her out.


Within the treatment room, Grace quickly unpacked a set of gleaming silver needles and several vials.


A glance at Colton and she instructed, "Remove your shirt."




With a curious tilt of his brow, Colton did as told,unfastening his buttons without a word.


Once the fabric slid away, his torso was exposed,revealing a strange pattern of dark bruises radiating out from his left chest.


Grace's gaze sharpened. The pattern had reached his heart, the severity catching her off guard.


"Lie down," she instructed tersely, lighting an alcohol lamp.




Colton followed her instructions, settling onto the treatment bed as she began sanitizing the needles over a softly glowing alcohol lamp.


Although her hands looked delicate, every movement was precise and confident.


"You're going to feel this," she cautioned, guiding the first needle with deliberate care to a spot just above his heart.


Colton's body reacted at once, muscles tensing beneath his skin.


The pain roared through him, blazing beneath his skin as if a live wire had touched his veins.


Grace worked without stopping, her hands deft as she placed seven more needles in quick succession.


Colton's brow glistened with sweat, but by the time she pressed in the final needle, the relentless ache that had lived in his chest for months faded to a gentle whisper.


"The toxins have been locked away for now," said Grace, uncorking a tiny rival and shaking out a lustrous white pill. "Take this one."


He reached for the pill and swallowed it with no second thoughts. The taste hit him hard, bitter than anything he had ever known.


"Mr. Byrd, I need a basin now," Grace said seriously.


Dominick wasted no time and brought the basin at once.


Almost instantly, Colton's stomach twisted, his throat most tightened, and he emptied a surge of blood into the waiting basin.


The blood was ink-black and looked terrifying.


Every doctor in the room froze, eyes wide at the sight.


An alarming quantity of that dark fluid left Colton's body.




Grace offered a gentle assurance. "You can relax. This process is called detoxification. There are still two sessions left before his system will be completely rid of toxins."


Relief washed over Colton once the nausea subsided,leaving him feeling unexpectedly lighter.


Turning to Dominick, she gave clear directions. "Fetch some water so he can rinse his mouth, and take this packet of herbs. Have someone boil wvater, drop in the herbs, and let them simmer for about thirty minutes.He'll need to soak in a medicinal bath once it's ready."


Having seen Grace work her skills firsthand, Dominick had no doubts. He quickly did what she asked.


Still, worry crept into his mnind. "Is it normal for him to lose that much blood?"


Grace responded with calm certainty, "There's no need for concern. The more that comes out, the cleaner his blood will be. He might feel a little dizzy afterward, but I have pills to restore his strength. Just make sure he eats more nutritious food."


In about thirty minutes, the bath was ready.


Once the time had passed, Grace took out the needles and checked Colton's condition, noticing his pulse had grown stronger and steadier.


With an encouraging nod, Dominick said, "I'll have the kitchen prepare nourishing meals for him."


"Just remember, moderation is important. Don't go overboard. He's already experiencing a decrease in sexual function. We need to take things slowly." Grace reminded him.


An uncomfortable silence fell between them, neither Colton nor Dominick daring to speak.


An awkward tension settled in the room.

###Chapter 43 Checking If Pigs Are Flying

Dominick quickly responded, "I'll get everything prepared right away."


After saying that, he bolted out of the room.


Colton's deep-set eyes lingered on Grace's delicate profile, and a slight smirk played on his lips. "That's strange. I don't recall ever being diagnosed with a decrease in sexual function."


Grace's cheeks turned a shade pinker at the remark."Of course, you wouldn't know. After all, you are not a doctor."


Colton found himself at a loss for words. Alright then. If the doctor had said it, who was he to argue?


Before long, Dominick had everything ready.


It was time for the bath.


"Strip down and soak in there for an hour. You will need to do this every day for the next month. It's a medicinal bath I have prepared with care. It's great for flushing out toxins and reinforcing your muscles," Grace explained smoothly.


Colton had endured the effects of poison for so long that his organs had sustained significant damage.After a majority of the poison was cleared, the special bath would help gradually restore and strengthen his internal systems.


Colton removed his clothes and stepped into the tub.


Grace then began using a specialized tool to flush out the poison.


Her movements were sharp, precise, and efficient,completing the procedure flawlessly.


The doctors observing from outside were already in shock. Everyone glanced at one another, eyes wide with shock and disbelief.


Refusing to accept what he was seeing, Rodney broke the silence. "Even if she struck the correct acupoints, if she fails to cure him and delays proper treatment, she couId be held legally accountable."


Unable to contain his mounting excitement, another doctor blurted out, "Could it be the long-lost Revival Technique?"


A doctor wearing glasses adjusted them with trembling fingers. "Yes, I heard that technique could work magic.But it has been lost for over a century. Legend says only Dr. Q ever mastered it. How could someone so young have learned something so rare?"
Dominick, who knew little about medicine, stood quietly nearby. But watching the astonishment on the faces of these renowned doctors, he couldn't help but look at Grace with a newfound sense of admiration.







Meanwhile, inside the steam-filled bathroom, the rich,earthy scent of herbs hung thick in the air.


Colton rested against the edge of the tub, eyes closed,as the warm, herb-infused water surrounded him. A faint tingling spread across his skin, a sensation that was oddly relaxing despite the underlying discomfort.


Grace stood nearby, the specialized tool in hand, her gaze sharp and focused as she studied his every reaction.



"How are you feeling?" she asked gently.


Colton slowly opened his eyes, the mist making his already deep gaze seem even more intense.


"It hurts a little," he murmured, his voice low and slightly rough.





Grace gave a slight nod. "That's expected. The herbs are taking effect, and the toxins in your system are flushing out."


She paused for a beat, then added, "But if the pain gets too much to bear, just say so. I'll adjust the dosage."


Colton's lips tugged upward, a playful glint flickering in his eyes."Are you worried about me?"


A warm flush crept up Grace's ears, but she masked it with practiced ease, turning her face away."I'm a doctor. Looking after my patients is part of the job."


Colton let out a chuckle, saying nothing further, and allowed his eyes to drift shut again.


Grace exhaled softly, a barely noticeable sigh of relief escaping her lips, though her heart still pounded erratically. Even while submerged in a medicinal bath,this man exuded a commanding presence that was impossible to ignore.






One hour later, Colton rose from the tub, water cascading down the contours of his sculpted muscles his physique a perfect blend of strength and symmetry.


Grace swiftly handed him a towel, her eyes darting away almost reflexively. "Dry off and get dressed. You don't want to catch a cold."


Colton accepted the towel, taking his time as he patted himself dry, his gaze trailing lazily to her flushed ears, a spark of amusement dancing in his eyes.

 
"Why is your face so red?" he asked. Grace stiffened, forcing a stern look onto her features."It's just too hot in here!"


Colton let out a low chuckle. "Is that right?"


Unwilling to let the teasing continue, Grace turned briskly toward the door. "I'll go prepare the herbs for tomorrow."


But just as she took a few steps, a warm, steady hand suddenly closed around her wrist.


Grace stopped in her tracks and slowly turned back to look at him.


Colton looked at her deeply and said in a low and steady voice, "Thank you, Grace."


Those simple words sent a ripple through Grace's heart. She bit her lower lip gently and replied softly "I'm only doing what I'm supposed to."


Colton held her gaze for a long, thoughtful moment before slowly letting go of her hand.


Grace quickly turned and stepped out of the bathroom,her heartbeat thudding in her chest like a war drum.


Outside, the team of doctors was still whispering among themselves, deep in discussion about Grace's medical skills. When Grace stepped out, they turned toward her, awe and disbelief written across every face.
It was difficult for them to believe that someone so young could possess medical abilities far beyond their own.


One particularly doubtful doctor couldn't resist the urge to examine Colton the moment he stepped out only to be left completely dumbfounded and thoroughly convinced.


Grace gave a subtle smile, then turned her attention toward the window.


The curious doctor leaned forward and asked, "What are you looking at? Is there something unusual outside?"


Grace glanced at him and replied coolly, "Just checking to see if pigs are flying. I've never seen that happen before either."
###Chapter 44 Slandering Grace For Cheating

A blush crept onto the doctor's cheeks before he managed to say,"Dr.your skills truly astonish me.I was blind to your brilliance until now. Please accept my apologies."


Turning away, Grace allowed a subtle, amused smile to appear. "No offense taken-I was just teasing, really."


A thoughtful pause followed before she added, "While most of the toxins have been flushed out of Mr.Pearson's system, he's not in the clear yet. He needs plenty of rest, more herbal baths, and continued care.If anyone wants to know more about my treatments, I'd be happy to explain."


Interest sparked immediately, and several doctors edged closer, eager for guidance.


"Dr. Q, can you explain the Revival Technique you demonstrated?"


"The herbal bath recipe looks complex, and some of those herbs seem rare. Can you share how you combine them?"



Genuine interest surrounded her, prompting Grace to explain in simple terms without holding back.


Her listeners nodded along, eyes wide with admiration as her words sank in.







Morning arrived, bringing the day of the exam results.Nerves and excitement mingled in the air as students filed into school.


Unlike her classmates, Gianna brimmed with enthusiasm. Hope for early admission filled her thoughts, and she felt certain her performance would secure it.



Her academic track record was flawless, and her adaptability always put her ahead of the curve.


Inside the classroom, conversation buzzed about the results. Gianna put on a calm face, doing her best to blend in.


Elsewhere, Grace's classmates were busy guessing who would earn the highest marks.


At her desk, Grace looked completely unbothered,drawing Adrianna's attention. "Grace, our teacher's going to share the scores soon. Are you really not the slightest bit nervous?"


Lifting her head, Grace responded easily, "What's there to worry about?" Adrianna found her remarkable. Even after all this ll she still didn't fully grasp how Grace could be SO unfazed.


Few could match that level of ease, and Adrianna found it genuinely impressive.


Nearby, a classmate scoffed, "No wonder she isn't nervous. She never stood a chance."


Just then, the door burst open and a student shouted,"The results are posted! Go see for yourselves!"


With that, excitement swept through the room as everyone hurried into the hallway.


At the very end of the crowd, Gianna and Lizzie moved at a leisurely pace, sure of themselves.


Gianna expected her name to be at the top. This was her moment to finally receive the admiration she'd always craved.


Without waiting, Adrianna latched onto Grace's arm."Come on, Grace! Let's go see the results!"


Though Grace had little interest, Adrianna's persistence wore her down, so she followed along.


At the bulletin board, students had already formed a tight crowd, jostling for a glimpse of the rankings.


Out of nowhere, someone cried out, "No way! Grace
Miller is at the very top!"


"How could that happen? Everyone said her grades were terrible, and she only got in because of some family favor."


"ls this for real? She has perfect scores in every subject! And look, she's ahead of Gianna by fifty points!"


No one had expected this turn of events.


Gianna stopped in her tracks, the smile vanishing from her face. Frustration flared as she pushed through the crowd, forcing her way to the front. The ranking list confirmed her fears. Grace's name sat at the very top,with hers just below. Her fingers clenched so tightly her nails bit into her palm.


"This can't be happening! There's got to be some mistake!" Gianna cried out, her composure shattered.All color drained from her face. All her focus was locked on Grace's name, as if she could erase it by staring alone.


Even Lizzie was at a loss. She stammered, "Gianna,this-this isn't possible, is it?"


Students all around shot each other bewildered looks,whispers passing from ear to ear.


"Gianna White really lost big this time..."


"Maybe Grace Miller was never struggling at all. Could she have been hiding her talent?"


"Those are perfect scores. Only a true genius could pull that off!"





"With those results, Grace Miller can definitely apply early to Summit University."


Lizzie's eyes darted across the crowd, quickly spotting Grace nearby with a faint, almost playful smile on her face.


Without hesitation, she stormed over, blurting out,"Grace Miller, did you cheat or something?"


Instantly, the hallway fell into an uneasy silence.


Adrianna fired back, her voice tight with anger. "Have you lost your mind? Just because Gianna White couldn't beat her, you start tossing out wild accusations?"



Not backing down, Lizzie tossed her hair and snapped,"She never had decent grades before. She only got into this school because of her connections! Now she's suddenly top of the class? There's no way that's legit.Gianna has always been at the top."


Right then, the dean strode into the midst of the crowd, his attention caught by the uproar."What's all this noise about?"

Lizzie tried to defend Gianna, whose distress was written all over her face.


She wasted no time complaining, "Grace Miller must have cheated-there's no way she could've gotten those marks otherwise!"


With a sharp adjustment of his glasses, the dean replied, "Mind your accusations. Her exam room was closely monitored. She broke no rules."


Lizzie opened her mouth to argue further,but Gianna quietly caught her arm and shook her head.


Everything about the exams had been strict, and Gianna herself knew Grace had been seated in the front row the entire time. Besides, no one could possibly answer every question correctly by cheating alone.


Still, Gianna couldn't accept that Grace had suddenly become so skilled.





No matter what the results said, she couldn't accept that Grace's improvement was real.


Her heart burned with frustration, determined that Grace wouldn't get lucky twice.


With dozens of eyes on her, Gianna gathered herself and forced a polite smile. "Grace, congratulations on winning first place. You really set a standard for the rest of us."



Outwardly, she acted gracious. Inside, resentment burned bright. She believed Grace had stolen what was rightfully hers. There was no way she would let Grace walk away with this victory unchallenged.
###Chapter 45 Admiration For Grace
A gentle smile tugged at Grace's lips. "You give me too much credit. Maybe luck was just on my side this time."


The comment made Gianna's fists clamp even tighter,her knuckles paling, veins standing out as if her anger might burst through her skin.


Excitement and gossip buzzed through the students around them.


"Who ever thought Grace would claim the top spot?Guess Gianna has to settle for silver from now on."


"Exactly! That's a massive difference. And listen to Grace-blaming luck. Nobody hits perfect scores just by being lucky."


"Gianna's days of being first are finished. Looks like it's Grace's turn in the spotlight."


"Summit University's professor is visiting soon, right?Let's see which of them catches his eye now."


Each word from the crowd felt like a fresh wound to Gianna, cutting deeper with every whisper. She pressed her nails deep into her palms, barely noticing the pain-every nerve was focused on the sting of their gossip.
Suddenly,Lizzie stormed forward, unable to stay silent.

"None of you know what you're talking about! Gianna's been number one for years! Anyone can have an off day."


No one missed the shift in the crowd, though.Admiration for Gianna had dimmed, replaced by genuine admiration for Grace.


Turning her back on the gossip, Grace strolled down the hallway, Adrianna falling into step beside her.


Back at their desks, Grace glanced over at Adrianna,taking in her cheek. It was clear the cream had worked wonders-that stubborn dark mark had faded even more. Soon, it would be gone for good.


Day by day, Adrianna watched her own skin improve and ached for the moment when her transformation would finally be complete.


Meanwhile, Johnny arrived at the bulletin board much later than everyone else. Helping Beatrice with her things had kept him busy.


When he finally made his way back, the crowd clustered around the scores was already thin.


Curiosity got the best of him, and he pushed forward,confident he'd find Grace's name at the very bottom.


His mind had already raced ahead-he'd report her failure straight to their mother, relishing the thought of seeing her disappointment.


Scanning the lowest scores, Johnny searched for her name. To his surprise, Grace was nowhere in sight.


Confusion crept across his face, and his brow furrowed as he scanned the list again.


Maybe she didn't even show up for the exams? Or could her scores have been so low that it wasn't worth putting on the list at all?


While he puzzled over the possibilities, a burst of excitement from the crowd snapped him back. "Wait-Grace Miller actually took first place?!"


There it was, plain as day-her name shining at the very top.


Shock hit Johnny hard, his hands clenching tight as he stared. "No way. This can't be real..." he muttered,disbelief thickening his voice.


Memories tumbled through his mind-Grace napping in class, scribbling nothing on her homework, finishing exams faster than anyone else. How could someone like that possibly score full marks?


Evening settled over the Holden home, golden light spilling through the windows.


Stepping inside, Johnny spotted Julia moving around

the dining table, arranging dishes with practiced care.


"You're back," she greeted him softly. "Go get cleaned up-dinner's about to start."


As they gathered around the table, Rodger placed his newspaper down and fixed Johnny with a steady look."How were your results this time?"


Johnny's fork hovered above his plate. He hesitated before mumbling, "It was fine. I made it to the top ten."


Rodger nodded once, his voice cool and firm. "Stay focused. I expect you to keep it up."


"Got it," Johnny replied flatly.


Julia's eyes drifted to Grace, who had put down her fork for a moment. Leaning close, she said softly,"Darling, don't let your grades weigh you down.However you did, you'll always be my sweet girl."


Worry lingered in her tone-Grace's brother always brought home strong results, and she didn't want her daughter to feel the weight of comparison.


But Grace only smiled, bright and easy. "No need to worry, Mom. I'm not upset. I actualy took first place.Full marks."


"You-first place?" Julia stared, stunned, as her fork slipped from her grasp and clattered against her plate.
Rodger's fork stopped halfway to his mouth,his hand trembling as he stared at Grace. "You're telling me you got full marks?"


Grace answered with a small nod, "That's right.Honestly, it wasn't that tough, so 1 wasn't all that surprised by the perfect score."


A silent look of disbelief passed between the couple.Could it be that their daughter was truly gifted? She breezed through exams that everyone else struggled with-almost without effort.


The idea seemed almost unreal.


Across the table, Johnny swallowed a surge of resentment. What was so special about this anyway?There had to be some kind of fluke behind her score.Maybe she puulled a fast one this time, but next exams she'd fall flat on her face.


Masking his irritation, Johnny shrugged, keeping his tone cool. "It's just one result. Don't set your expectations too high or you'll end up disappointed."


Julia's expression hardened as she shot him a warning look. "Mind your attitude. Your sister came out on top this time, and you didn't. Maybe it's your turn to take a few lessons from her."


The urge to argue flashed in Johnny's eyes, but with his father watching, he could only mutter through lenched teeth, "Yeah, I'll learn from her."


Brushing off his mood, Julia's joy bubbled over as she scooped more food onto Grace's plate. "Sweetie, you amaze me. Eat up, you need the energy."


"Thanks," Grace answered in her usual calm tone.


Joy colored Julia's words as she declared, "This is a reason to celebrate. We'll mark the occasion-tomorrow we're going shopping."


Rodger's quiet chuckle spoke volumes, though he said nothing.Everyone knew Julia never needed much of a reason to spend-and she always found the best deals.


Suddenly, her phone chimed. Julia's face lit up. "Look at this-Seraphic Jewelry's having their big members'sale this weekend. What luck! Now's the perfect chance to treat you to something shiny and new."
###Chapter 46 Giving Her The Best
On Saturday morning, just after sunrise, Julia brought Grace to the biggest shopping center.


The moment Julia stepped out of the car, she spotted Eliana arriving with Claire and Gianna close behind.


Eliana didn't seem to be in great shape. As they neared, Julia tilted her head slightly. "Eliana,have you seen a doctor recently?"


Eliana blinked, caught off guard, then answered, "I'm alright, Julia. Probably just tired. Still, I've booked a consultation with a specialist for Monday-just to be careful."


She hadn't originally intended to, but something in her chest didn't feel right.


Moreover, Grace's confidence during their last encounter was impossible to overlook. So Eliana figured she'd go, maybe pick up some medicine while she was at it.


"That's smart. So what brings you out today?" Julia asked.



"I thought I'd let the girIs choose some jewelry," Eliana replied casually.
Julia raised a brow-what a coincidence.


Claire chimed in, clearly pleased with herself. "Gianna scored second in the whole school on her exams, Aunt Julia. She definitely earned something special. That's why my mom brought us here. Are you jewelry shopping too?"


Claire had chosen her words carefully. She had heard whispers about Grace's background-that she was from an orphanage and had only gotten admitted to that school through favors, not merit.


She'd never taken a liking to Grace, so her comment was meant to sting, to put Grace on edge in front of everyone.


Julia's smile sharpened. "Yes, Grace scored full marks this time, top of the entire school. I brought her here to celebrate."



Claire's grin vanished, and Gianna's expression went stiff.





"W-What? You got a perfect score?" Claire stammered,staring at Grace. "How come? You're first, and Gianna's second?"



Grace nodded with ease. "That's right."


Eliana looked genuinely surprised. "Julia, are you being serious?"
 Julia rested a hand on Grace's arm and spoke with ease. "Why would I make something like that up?"


Just yesterday, Johnny had dodged the topic but didn't deny it, Julia took that as confirmation.


Gianna's fingers curled into tight fists, her nails pressing hard into her palms until they lost color. She managed a smile. "It's true. Grace performed impressively this tme. I can't deny it."


Grace responded with a mild, courteous smile."Thanks.Maybe it was just my good lucky."


"Yeah, you probably just got lucky this once," Claire shot back, clearly annoyed. "Next time, you'll probably be dead last."


"You think so? Guess we'll find out," Grace said calmly.


"Since we're all here, why don't we go in together?"Julia offered.


Inside, the boutique manager came out to welcome them personally. "It's wonderful to see you guys. We have a special preview of our newest collection just for VIPs today."


Eliana nodded, her pride barely concealed. She turned to Claire and Gianna. "Go ahead, pick out whatever you want. It's my treat."


"Thanks,Mom."
Thank you, Aunt Eliana."

Julia leaned toward Grace. "Let's head up to the fifth floor afterward. They've stocked some really nice pieces-fresh from the latest release. You'll get first pick."


Everyone froze for a moment.


The fifth floor housed Seraphic Jewelry, the most talked-about label in high society.


Though only three years into the market, Seraphic Jewelry had built a name for itself with bold, elegant styles and unmatched detail, quickly becoming a status symbol among the elite.


While not officially labeled a premier brand, its pricing matched the best of them. What truly set it apart,however, was its fiercely selective access, customers needed to spend over ten million and be referred by a senior client just to apply for membership.


And as for Ultra VIP access? That was nearly mythical.


There were only a few Ultra VIPs in all of the city.


Seraphic Jewelry's limited collections were notoriouisly hard to obtain-Eliana herself had waited three months just to secure a single piece.


When Claire overheard Julia mention the fifth floor, her expression shifted.

She forced a smile, her grip tightening around her bag."Aren't Seraphic Jewelry's latest pieces only available by appointment? Aunt Julia, do you have access?"


Julia's smile was composed. "I'm one of their Ultra VIPs. They reached out yesterday to let me know some new arrivals had come in. I thought it'd be the perfect time to bring Grace."


A flicker of envy passed through Gianna's eyes, but she quickly masked it."Grace, you're really lucky to have such a caring mother."


Grace gave her a cool glance, saying nothing in return.


Julia beamed.-"She's my daughter. Of course I want to give her the best."


With that, she and Grace made their way to the top floor.


Everyone in the upper circles understood-access to the fifth floor marked a shift in class.


Fewer than a hundred people had clearance, and only two guests were allowed entry at once.


Watching Julia escort Grace up, Eliana's smile faltered for a second.Beside her, Gianna fumed silently.Why?was Grace the one getting special treatment?


Se swallowed the bitterness and turned to Eliana."Do you think Aunt Julia doesn't like me anymore? She used to treat me so warmly, but ever since Grace showed up, something feels different."


Eliana huffed, clearly displeased. "Julia's just too taken with that girl. Don't let it bother you. You're outstanding, and none of this is your fault. Comne,let's havea look around."


"Exactly, Gianna. Don't feel bad. You're amazing, and if others can't see it, that's on them,"Claire supported.


Gianna's shoulders relaxed a little. "I really am lucky to have you both."
###Chapter 47 A Discount

"Let's head upstairs and look at the jewelry." Claire kept a close watch on Gianna, noticing how bravely she forced a smile. The sight tugged at her heart.


With a quiet nod, Gianna said,-"Sure."


They wandered through the fourth floor, led by Eliana,yet it was clear neither girl had any real interest in the displays around them.


Every so often, Gianna's gaze drifted upward toward the fifth floor, her fingers twisting nervously at the hem of her blouse.



Jealousy simmered beneath the surface. She couldn't help but wonder just how many treasures Julia was buying for Grace this timne.


Picking up on Gianna's distracted mood, Claire leaned close and whispered, "Why don't we sneak a peek upstairs? It's not like the fifth floor is completely off-limits."


A flicker of worry crossed Gianna's face. "But those membership rules are really strict..."


Claire's grin widened with mischief. "We'll just say we're with Aunt Julia. Are they really going to throw us

 They quickly found a reason to send Eliana off and slipped into the elevator, determined to reach the fifth floor undetected.


Stepping out, they barely took two steps before a security guard appeared in front of them. "May I see your membership cards, ladies?"


Chin lifted in defiance, Claire answered, "We're with Mrs. Julia Holden. She's our aunt."



The guard answered with practiced politeness,"Seraphic Jewelry only allows members bring one guest. Mrs. Holden already has her daughter with her."


Meanwhile, the fifth floor gleamed with new collections. Julia admired a glittering display. "Grace,come here. What do you think of this bracelet?"


She chose the newest and most expensive diamond bracelet and slipped it onto Grace's wrist.


Julia had Grace try it on.It hugged her wrist as if it belonged there, the stones throwing sparks under the showroom lights and making her skin look impossibly delicate.



The store manager exclaimed, "Mrs. Holden, this piece couldn't suit her better. It's as if it was crafted just for her."
Julia beamed, completely pleased. "Nothing could look finer on Grace."


Grace's lips curved into a smile as she responded,"Mom, I really don't need anything."


"You're such a silly girl. Why wouldn't you want it?Gianna begged me for a bracelet just last year,swearing it would bring her good fortune. You're my precious child. How could I let you have less than anyone else?"


Without waiting for Grace to reply, Julia turned to the salesperson and asked her to wrap up the bracelet.


A knowing look appeared on the salesperson's face as she offered flattery. "Mrs. Holden, your taste is impeccable. This bracelet is unique, just like your daughter. She's as lovely as you, and when she wears this, it's as if she's the perfect ambassador for our store."



Glowing with pride, Julia decided one bracelet wasn't enough. She added another, plus a dazzling ring.


Before long, the running total shot past ten million dollars.


Seeing the number, Grace's brow furrowed. She discreetly texted Patrick, asking him to apply a discount before they paid. Letting her mother overspend on her account just didn't sit right with her.
Patrick, on the receiving end, immediately set things in motion to make it happen.


Boredom had led Grace to open this store a few years back, and it had quickly turned into a booming business.


When Julia reached for her card to pay, the store manager hurried over, all respect and smiles. "Mrs.Holden, as an Ultra VIyou automatically receive a special discount today."


Julia's eyes widened in surprise. "Really? I was sure this place never gave out discounts."


With a polished smile, the manager explained,"You've been with us a long time, Mrs. Holden. Our system automatically promoted you to Ultimate VIP. Today, you receive thirty percent off."


Grace slipped her arm through her mother's and teased gently, "Mom, it looks like you shop here often enough for the store to reward you."


Delighted, Julia squeezed her daughter's hand."See?You really are my lucky star. This is quite a savings."


The two left the boutique feeling cheerful after the unexpected discount.


At the entrance, they came face-to-face with Claire and Gianna.
Julia stopped and asked, "What brings you girls up here?"


Claire hesitated, searching for the right words. "Aunt Julia, we were looking for you. It's almost lunchtime,and my mother thought we should all have a meal together." Thinking fast, Claire spun a reason on the spot.


After being denied entry, frustration lingered, and confessing the real reason for their visit would have only made things worse.


Julia accepted the explanation without question."Alright then. Let's go."


Lunch had been the plan anyway.


Rejoining Eliana, the group gathered and made their way toward the restaurant.


Catching sight of the elegant jewelry bags in Grace's hands, Gianna felt envy prick at her like a thorn.What was Julia thinking, spoiling Grace with so much jewelry? That jewelry had to be worth a fortune-easily more than ten million. Jealousy gnawed at her,impossible to ignore.


With a sly glance at Grace, Claire piped up with a sudden idea to eat somewhere extravagant.


She suspected Grace wouldn't know the first thing about fine dining-surely, she would trip over every bit of etiquette and embarrass herself.


Both Claire and Gianna longed for a moment to vent their irritation, hoping to catch Grace out of her depth.


A knowing look passed between them, and Gianna was quick to play along. "There's a really fancy place nearby. Let's give it a shot."


Eliana chimed in enthusiastically, "Sounds good!"


Neither Julia nor Grace objected, so they went along with the idea.


Together, the group set off toward the popular upscale restaurant, anticipation buzzing in the air.
###Chapter 48 Making A Fool Of Themselves
Stepping into the restaurant, the group found themselves surrounded by quiet luxury. Gentle lights cast a warm glow, and the staff welcomed them with graceful professionalism as they were guided to their table.



A flicker of triumph passed between Claire and Gianna.Choosing this fancy place had been no accident. Both were certain Grace would falter and make a spectacle of herself. They believed any girl who grew up in an orphanage wouldn't have a clue about high-end dining.


Hardly able to contain herself, Gianna reached for the menu. She flipped through its pages with exaggerated elegance and announced her order with relish, "I'll start with escargot, then foie gras with black truffle, and for my main,beef Wellington-medium rare."


That order was followed by a pointed glance at Grace,her expression practically daring her to keep up.


Moments later, she traded another knowing look with Claire.


Playing along, Claire smiled sweetly and slid the ornate menu toward Grace. "Would you like some suggestions? The house specialties are quite something."


Sliding the ornate menu closer, she offered it to Grace.


Gianna chimed in with mock sincerity, "You probably haven't been to a place like this much. Need me to explain how it works?"



Meeting their eyes with steady calm, Grace's lips formed a quiet smile. "That's not necessary. I can handle it myself."


A barely audible snort escaped Gianna. She muttered,"Keep pretending."



Julia noticed the exchange, a crease of concern forming on her brow, but before she could intervene,Grace turned to the waiter. With flawless French and an air of confidence, she made her order. She ordered lobster salad as an appetizer, followed by Rossini-style filet mignon cooked medium rare for her main course.To complement her meal, she chose a bottle of 2009Château Margaux.



The waiter paused, pleasantly surprised by her fluency,and replied with a respectful nod."An	excellent selection,mademoiselle."


Both Claire and Gianna sat motionless, shock written plainly across their faces.
Was she really speaking French and that smoothly?


Even Eliana's eyes sparkled with curiosity. "You speak French, Grace?"


Grace simply shrugged, her tone humble."Abit.Just something I picked up along the way."


Pride shimmered in Julia's eyes. "Grace learns everything so quickly."


Claire forced a grin, her voice just a touch too bright."Yeah... that's really something."


Gianna refused to back down, snapping her napkin open with exaggerated care, eyes glued to Grace,ready for even the smallest mistake.


Grace, on the other hand, settled her napkin across her lap with the kind of grace that belonged in etiquette manuals, every gesture calm and precise.


Soon enough, the appetizers made their way to the table. Gianna stared at her plate of escargot, appetite vanishing in an instant.


Her fingers trembled as she tried to work the snail tongs, fumbling clumsily.


"Would you like a tip?" Grace offered in a gentle tone,leaning over. "It's easier if you tilt your hand just so-"


"I can handle it!" Gianna snapped, gripping the utensil  too tightly. In a flash, the snail shell slipped free and launched itself onto Claire's dress, leaving behind a slick trail of garlic butter.


A shriek burst from Claire. "My dress! Look what you've done!"


Conversation in the restaurant hushed as curious faces turned in their direction, some openly staring at the commotion.



Embarrassment colored Eliana's face, her mood darkening by the second.


Meanwhile, Julia brought her spoon to her lips, the flicker of a smile betraying her amusement.


As the main courses arrived, Grace managed her utensils with quiet confidence, expertly carving her filet mignon with a finesse that put both Claire and Gianna to shame.



Gianna faced her own disaster. Her beef Wellington had been cooked to ruin-dry, tough, and nearly impossible to cut through.


Frustration bubbling over, she slammed her knife down, shattering the pastry shell. A splash of meat juice leapt onto her cheek, sealing her embarrassment.


Humiliation burned hot across her cheeks.



No one at the table missed the contrast. Grace's composure was effortless, her knowledge of dining unmistakable.


Pride warmed Julia's features. "You never know what Grace will surprise us with next,"she remarked, her voice bright.


Across from her, Claire and Gianna sat stiffly, their plan to disgrace Grace in shambles, their faces darkening with each passing moment.


Disappointment pressed down, thick and heavy.


Unable to hide her resentment, Gianna eyed the elegant shopping bags resting by Grace's side. Her voice came out brittle and sharp. "Julia, you really go all out for Grace. All that jewelry must've cost a small fortune."



It was reckless spending, in her opinion. If Ethel ever got wind of it, Grace would be in for a scolding.


Julia brushed it aside with a carefree laugh, "That barely cost anything, Only seven million."


Seven million? Jealousy lit a fire in Gianna's eyes. Just a year ago, she'd pleaded for a bracelet worth a mere million, yet now Grace had wvalked away with jewelry bags worth several times more.


Claire managed a smile that barely hid her discomfort."Grace, you hit the jackpot."
With a small smile and a gentle tone, Grace replied,"Honestly, having a mom who spoils mne feels like a real gift."


Claire and Gianna gripped their forks so tightly it was a miracle the utensils didn't snap.


There was no need for food anymore. Anger alone left them feeling full.


Not far away, Colton dined at another table in the same restaurant.


This spot was owned by Ryan-his fingerprints were on every high-end eatery and porivate club in the city. Now that Colton was feeling better, he showed up for meals from time to time. Otherwise, his uncle would probably think he had disappeared for good.


His gaze landed on Grace and her family. He had no intention of disturbing them. Instead, he leaned over and quietly told Dominick to pick up their tab.


Dominick took care of everything right away.


So,when the meal wrapped up and Julia made her way to the register, she was surprised to learn someone had already settled the bill. The cashier mentioned a Mr.Pearson had taken care of it.


The group exchanged puzzled looks. Grace knew instantly who it was, but she decided to keep quiet.
Claire, of course, couldn't help but stir up some mischief. "Maybe one of Gianna's fans decided to pay for us. She has boys lined up around the block just to catch her attention."



Pretending to be embarrassed, Gianna said, "You have to stop, Claire. That's not true."


Inside, she clung to the hope that it really was one of her admirers-certainly not someone doing it for Grace.



Grace ignored the comment completely. Some people just never tire of flattering themselves.

###Chapter 49 To Be Completely Healed Soon
Grace returned home, thinking Colton should've paid the bill today. That thought made her feel a bit indebted.



Since she was visiting him for a follow-up the next day,she felt it would be the right time to thank him in person.


Colton had been under treatment for a while now, and the results were impressive. He could stand and walk with ease. At this rate, he'd be fully recovered soon-all thanks to Grace's efforts.


The next day, she arrived at Colton's residence on schedule.



The butler welcomed her at the door with a polite smile. "Miss Miller, Mr. Pearson is waiting in his room."


Grace gave a small nod and walked straight there.


As she pushed the door open, she saw Colton standing by the large window. Sunlight streamed in, casting a glow around his tall figure. He looked calm and elegant.


Hearing her enter, he turned with a soft smile."Good morning."


"Morning. You're recovering well. You can stand for quite a while now," Grace said.


Colton let out a light chuckle. "All thanks to your healing hands."


She placed her kit down and motioned for him to sit then began her routine check-up.


She examined him carefully, eyes focused.


After a moment, she looked up. "Everything looks great. Keep this up for another two weeks, and you'll be completely healed." She spoke calmly, as always.


A flicker of amusement crossed Colton's eyes. The news was music to his ears.



"Thank you," he said sincerely.


"You're welcome. And by the way, thank you for yesterday.I assume you paid for the meal?"


"It was nothing. Compared to what you've done for me,a meal doesn't count," he replied. He hadn't expected her to catch on so quickly.


Grace packed her kit. "I was only doing my job.Besides, you've already paid the consultation fee."


She glanced at her watch. "I've got other things to attend to, so I'll be going."
"I'll have the driver take you home," Colton offered.He still needed to soak in a medicinal bath and couldn't see her off personally.


"No need. I have another stop," Grace declined She was going to meet Patrick.


Colton didn't insist. There would be plenty of chances in the future. He watched her leave, his gaze gentle and thoughtful. He lightly touched the spot where she had brushed against him. The warmth still lingered.


Afterward, Grace took a taxi to the city center. She had arranged to meet Patrick there.


As she stepped out of the car, her eyes caught sight of a couple not far away, acting very close.


The young woman wore a white skirt and a light blue off-shoulder top. She giggled sweetly, nestled in the arms of a suited middle-aged man. She leaned into him, fingers lazily tracing circles on his chest. Her high heels clicked lightly on the pavement.


Grace narrowed her eyes. The silhouette looked familiar.





The woman turned slightly, and Grace's eyes widened -it was Beatrice.


Yes, no doubt about it. Johnny's crush, Beatrice.


Grace had saved her before, so her face was Beatrice whispered something to the man, making him laugh out loud. His pudgy hand slid along her waist, his smile a little too eager.


He looked to be in his forties. His suit strained over his large belly, his grin downright lecherous.


Grace couldn't believe it. Beatrice had always seemed so sweet and innocent. Did Johnny even know who she really was?


By the time Grace looked again, the two were gone.


"Hi." A familiar voice pulled her back.


She turned to see Patrick. "Finally. You're here."


"Sorry for the delay. What were you staring at just now?" he asked, noticing her distracted look.


"Nothing important. Oh, here-the pills for this month,"she said, handing him a small bottle. She had been making extra lately.


Patrick smiled as he took it. "You've been on fire lately."





"When am I not?" Grace raised a brow.


He laughed. "Right, right, you're amazing every day.Oh, there's a Aurora Gem Fair this weekend. Tons of raw stones.Interested?"
She passed him the bottle, sunlight brushing against her fingers. "Aurora Gem Fair?"


"Yeah. They'll even have many raw stones from abroad.Might be something special there."


Grace was intrigued. She had a knack for finding hidden treasures.





"Sounds good. Just send me the invite when you get it."





She also remembered Julia liked jade. Maybe she'd find something special for her.


After they parted ways, Grace returned home.


Julia wasn't back yet. Johnny was in the living room,talking on the phone.


"Beatrice, not free again?" he asked, sounding a little let down.





Grace couldn't hear the reply.


Johnny continued, "Working? Don't overdo it,okay?|can come to you instead. Alright then. I got you a gift.I'll keep saving for you."


After a while, he ended the call with a sigh.


Turning around, he saw Grace standing nearby. She must have heard everything. Embarrassed, he snapped,"What are you staring at?"
Grace answered calmly, "A man made a fool of himself."

###Chapter 50 Having A Knock -off



Johnny stopped in his tracks, a shadow falling across his face. "Grace, what are you getting at?"


She answered with a careless shrug, "You heard me."


She made no effort to clarify, already turning for the staircase.


Johnny stepped in front of her, blocking her path."Explain yourself."


Her eyes flashed with a teasing glint. "Didn't your beloved Beatrice mention where she was spending her day?"


He glared at her, suspicion hardening his features."You saw her?"



She replied without emotion, "Saw her cuddled up with some older guy. She looked pretty pleased about it."



"That's a lie!" Johnny shot back, his tone defensive."She's not like that, and I won't let you twist the truth.Stop trying to turn me against her!"
Some truths cut deeper than any rumor.


"Believe whatever you want," Grace replied with a casual air.



She never imagined Johnny could be so blinded by affection. One day, the truth would hit him square in the face.



School came the next morning, and Johnny wasted no time hunting for Beatrice.


She greeted him with the sweetness and shyness he adored. That was all the reassurance he needed. He convinced himself Beatrice would never do anything wrong.Grace must have been jealous, trying to poison him against the girl he liked.



Later that afternoon, the third period brought with it a basketball game.


Adrianna tugged Grace along, insisting they watch.Their walk down the corridor put them face-to-face with Beatrice and her friend, Chloe Robinson.


Without missing a beat, Chloe turned her gaze on Grace and remarked, "It's always the same-some people just have to flaunt their fake bags."


Heads turned as everyone noticed the striking resemblance between Grace's handbag and Beatrice's,
though Grace's stood out with a golden triangular emblem gleaming on the front, giving it an extra touch of elegance. Beatrice's didn't have it.


Still, it didn't take long for rumors to spark-Grace's must be a cheap imitation.


After all, Beatrice's handbag had been a present from Johnny himself. No one would ever believe he'd buy anything but the real deal.


Gossip followed Grace everywhere. Raised in an orphanage before joining the Holden household,she had never enjoyed the privileges others did. People thought it only logical she would settle for a fake,eager to keep up appearances.


To Adrianna, this was too much. "Chloe,what's that supposed to mean? Who are you calling out for having a knock-off?"


Chloe didn't miss a beat, rolling her eyes dramatically "Isn't it obvious? Grace Miller's handbag looks just like Beatrice's. But Beatrice's came from Johnny Holden -why would hers be a fake? Tell me, how could Grace ever afford the real thing?"


Her voice carried through the hall, making sure as many students as possible overheard.


Adrianna found the whole scene absurd. She knew full well that Grace had more taste-and means-than any
of them suspected. Grace's handbag was actually finer and looked far more high-end.


All the while,Beatrice hung back, lowering her gaze and saying softly, "Chloe, stop... Maybe Grace really just likes this design, and that's why she..."


Her tone was sweet, but every word poured fuel on the fire, leaving everyone convinced Grace's handbag was a cheap knock-off.


Adrianna bristled, her cheeks flushed with anger."You're all unbelievable..."



The shamelessness on display was almost too much to take.



Grace gently reached out to stop Adrianna, her smile never faltering. "Actually, I bought this from the brand's official store. It's genuine."


Chloe retorted instantly, "As if anyone would buy that story."


Jealousy flickered in Beatrice's eyes,barely masked by her air of disdain. What strange twist of fate allowed Grace, of all people, to end up with the Holdens? How did an orphan find a place among them?


In her mind,Johnny was hopeless. If he cared so much,why hadn't he asked his mother to bring her into their family himself?
Right at that moment, Johnny appeared. His basketball jersey clung to his frame, hair still damp from his time on the court.



He'd just finished warming up for the game. Spotting the commotion and catching sight of Beatrice, he made his way over with a puzzled look. "What's happening here?"


Chloe wasted no time, directing everyone's attention to Grace. "Johnny, look at this! Grace says her handbag is from the official store, but it's just a fake copy of Beatrice's!"


Johnny's eyes narrowed as he inspected Grace's handbag.



That gold triangle on the handbag-he recognized it instantly. It belonged to this year's Lady Diamond limited run, only ten bags like it in the entire world,each marked with its own serial number.



"Johnny.." Beatrice's voice quivered as she slipped her hand around his arm, her eyes shining with unshed tears. "If Grace really loves that bag, she can borrow mine for a while. She's part of your family now,andl wouldn't want anyone saying she has to settle for a fake."



Every ounce of patience drained from Grace. Before she could respond, Johnny jumped in. A sheepish grin
crept across his face as he scratched the back of his head. "Actually, Grace's bag is the real deal. It's even a limited edition. I could only afford a regular one after saving up for ages. My mom gifted Grace hers -she's got VIP status at the brand."


That settled it. The entire truth had come to light. A flush of humiliation spread across Beatrice's cheeks,as if she'd just been slapped. Seconds earlier, she'd paraded her certainty that Grace was carrying a counterfeit.



Now, the students surrounding them shot her uncertain glances, their voices buzzing with surprise.


"So Beatrice only has the standard version?"



"She tried to say Grace was fakingit, but Grace's bag is the real deal-limited edition!"



"Can you believe she even offered to let Grace borrow hers?"



"This whole scene turned upside down so fast.I didn't expect that at all!"
###Chapter 51 Dominating The Game



Anger flared brightly across Beatrice's features before quickly giving way to a pale shock; she clenched her fists so tightly her nails bit sharply into her palms. How could she have possibly guessed that the handbag Grace casually held had come straight from Johnny's mother? What did his mom see in Grace that made her so generous toward her? Even more generous than with her own son?


Nearby,Chloe shifted uncomfortably, silently pleading to evaporate from the scene.


In mere moments, everything had spiraled wildly out of control, leaving everyone baffled.


Spotting Beatrice's ghostly expression, Johnny shot Grace a heated glare before gently saying, "Beatrice,don't mind Grace. She clearly doesn't recognize quality when she sees it."


Yet as soon as those words escaped his lips, regret nipped at him. The jab felt petty-who truly misunderstood the situation here? Who was actually blind to a rare treasure right before them?


Without another word, Grace smiled softly and walked
away with Adrianna.


Frustration surged through Beatrice,who slammed her foot against the ground.


Not long afterward, everyone drifted toward the basketball court.


The long-awaited faceoff between Briskvale High and their rival school had finally arrived. Students packed thesidelines, their voices rising in support of their team.


It wouldn't be long before Johnny, one of the school's own, took his place in the game, ready to represent them on the field.


Excited cheers echoed among the gathered students,each voice filled with pride for their school's reputation.


Anticipation rippled through the crowd, and they eagerly awaited the game's start.


With both sides bringing equal strength to the field,neither team could expect an easy victory.


At the front of the crowd, Beatrice held her pom-poms high, her cheerful smile once again lighting up her face.



She called out warmly, waving with enthusiasm,"Johnny, you've got this! Victory is ours for sure!"
Johnny responded with a quick nod but found his attention drifting toward Grace, wondering what thoughts hid behind her quiet eyes. Did she even grasp the basic rules of basketball?



As soon as the whistle blew, Johnny dazzled the crowd, landing several outstanding layups to roaring applause.


The team quickly pulled ahead by three points, and excitement rippled through the crowd.


Yet,basketball required more than individual brilliance.Soon Johnny's stamina faltered, and their slim lead slipped away.


During a swift counterattack, Johnny desperately dodged a rival defender but crashed to the floor,wincing painfully as his ankle twisted sharply.


A collective gasp echoed from the stands.


Beatrice hesitated, readying herself to run forward,but paused when she saw Grace already at Johnny's side.



Grace gently examined the injury and calmly explained,"Your ankle's sprained. You need ice immediately or it'll swell."



Sweat dripping from his brow, Johnny stubbornly
pushed her hand aside. "I don't need your help!"



Grace's brows furrowed slightly, her voice steady."Moving around now will only worsen it."



A teammate quickly chimed in, "Johnny,she's right.Let's handle this properly."


Efficiently, Grace provided basic first aid, expertly stabilizing Johnny's ankle.



However, another problem quickly arose. With Johnny sidelined, who could possibly step up?


Were they supposed to just accept defeat?


Johnny limped to the bench while the coach,worried and uncertain, scanned the substitutes.


Losing their star point guard was disastrous, as the skill gap was enormous.


Then suddenly Grace spoke,her voice surprisingly calm."Coach,put me in."


Basketball wasn't exactly rocket science.


Watching their struggle from the sidelines had already exhausted her patience.


A stunned silence briefly overtook the crowd before laughter erupted everywhere.
Beatrice sneered, "Grace, have you lost it? This isn't some childish game! What can you do?"


"Surely, in a school this large, there has to be at least one person who fits the role perfectly."



Curiously, the coach eyed Grace. "Do you even play basketball?"



Grace casually glanced at the court and answered,"Is it supposed to be hard?"


Without hesitation, she strode confidently onto the court and picked up an abandoned basketball.


Mocking eyes watched as she effortlessly tossed the ball upward.


The ball curved beautifully, dropping perfectly through the hoop.


An astonished quiet spread rapidly through the crowd.


Grace calmly turned back to the coach. "Can I join now?"



Before the coach could speak, the referee sharply blew his whistle and announced, "Substitution approved.Resume play!"


Beatrice paled once more, her nails nearly piercing her skin
She couldn't fathom that Grace genuinely knew how to play, and rather impressively, it seemed.



"She only made that shot by sheer luck," Beatrice shouted to the others nearby. "Just wait until she's actually out there, and she's going to make a complete fool of herself!"



When the game picked back up and the players noticed that Briskvale High had put a girl on the court,they exchanged amused grins, clearly not taking her seriously.


"Seriously, Briskvale? Is this your idea of comnpetition?"mocked their point guard.


Grace simply regarded him coldly, saying nothing.


The whistle sounded,resuming play.


Underestimating Grace severely, their opponents paid her no mind, until she swiftly maneuvered past their lax defense, elegantly scoring a flawless layup.



"Whoa!"



"She actually knows what she's doing?"


"That move was incredibole!"


Throughout the remainder of the game, Grace dominated effortlessly. Her lightning speed, fluid
dribbles, and precise passes opened easy scoring chances for teammates.




More impressively, she drained multiple three-pointers from afar, decisively turning the tables in their favor.
###Chapter 52 A Wager


From the sidelines, Johnny stood frozen, eyes wide with disbelief as Grace dominated the basketball court.


Maybe he'd been wrong about her all along. In his mind, she had always been just another pretty girl without a clue-how wrong he'd been.


In the audience, Beatrice's jaw tightened, frustration spilling from every word. "Hmph, nothing but blind luck. No reason for her to act so smug."


For as longas she could remember, she held the spotlight and basked in everyone's admiration.


Now,though, every gaze was fixed on Grace.


By the end of the game, there was no doubt-Grace would walk away as Briskvale High's new sensation.



The scoreboard flashed a twenty-point lead, and wild cheers shook the bleachers.



For their rivals, it was the worst defeat in recent memory.



Grace's teammates swarmed around her in a blur of excitement. "Grace Miller! That was unreal! You're the
real MVP!"


She brushed off the praise with a gentle smile."Everyone played their part. That's what matters."


Across the gym, Johnny sat slouched on the bench,his thoughts tangled as he watched her. Only now did he begin to wonder if he ever truly saw the real Grace.


Beatrice stomped over, envy lacing her words. "Don't get too full of yourself. You only got lucky coming off the bench.Big deal."


Grace gave no answer, choosing instead to turn and walk away.


As she left, Johnny's voice cut through the noise."Grace!"


She paused and glanced over her shoulder.


His mouth moved hesitantly before he finally muttered,"Thanks."


Grace's acknowledgment was brief-a small nod-before she walked off, Adrianna falling in step beside her.



All around, students buzzed with energy, the thrill of the game echoing in every conversation.


Later that night, Johnny hobbled into the Holden
house,wincing with each step. Julia's eyes narrowed with concern as soon as she saw him. "What happened to you, huh? Did a wild animal chase you home?"


Johnny let out a dramatic sigh. "Seriously,Mom? I'm your own son. Can't you act worried for once?"


Julia snorted. "If I didn't care, you wouldn't still be in one piece.You're fine."


A moment later, Grace stepped up, pressing a smnall bottle of liniment into his hand. "Try this for a couple of days. You'll heal up just fine."


Julia wasted no time in pulling Grace close for a warm hug."You're always so thoughtful,sweetheart."


Turning away,Johnny pretended not to notice, the sight stinging more than he cared to admit.Sometimes he wondered if he'd somehow been switched at birth. Grace fit in so naturally, it was as if she belonged more than he ever did.


"Hey, Grace, did you hear? The Aurora Gem Fair's happening this weekend." Julia's face brightened as the memory of the invitation came rushing back. Her voice rang with excitement. "We're all heading there together. I want you two to see something truly unforgettable."



"Count me in, Mom," said Grace, her lips curling into a warm grin. Of course, she already had her own
invitation tucked away. Still, tagging along with everyone else suited her just fine.






The weekend rolled around before anyone realized it.


Rodger called everyone together and they piled into the car, ready for the outing. Word had spread that the fair would showcase a breathtaking assortment of rare jewels this year.


Naturally, Gianna made sure she wasn't left behind.


The instant she heard Rodger and Julia would bring their kids to the fair, she wasted no time letting everyone know she planned to join them.


She'd attended countless gem fairs before.


For those in the upper crust, knowing gemstones was a mark of true breeding. No one wanted to look clueless in front of society's sharpest eyes.


This was her moment to make an impression on Rodger and Julia, a chance to remind them she was still the Holden to watch.


Confidence radiated from Gianna. Her knack for choosing the best raw stones had never failed her.Most of her picks ended up revealing rare, expensive minerals.
She shot a sidelong glance at Grace, who gazed quietly out the window, lost in thought.


"Just wait," she muttered to herself. "It won't be long before you're put in your place."


The car pulled up outside the bustling exhibition hall.


Inside, the Aurora Gem Fair had blossomed into an extravagant affair. Everywhere one looked, influential faces mingled and the atmosphere buzzed with excitement.



Every booth seemed to sparkle with an array of polished gemstones and a multitude of rugged,untouched mineral stones.


Most eyes, however, were drawn to the main attraction-the suspenseful mineral auctions, where every unopened rock might hide a small treasure or a life-changing windfall.


Gianna strolled along the aisles, her lips curling into a sly smile. "Grace, I can't help but notice you've been staring at those uncut stones for ages," she chimed,her tone syrupy sweet. "Why don't we spice things up with a little bet?"


She had waited for a moment like this andfinally saw her opening.
Grace looked over, catching the bold sparkle in Gianna's eyes with ease. A faint smile appeared as she replied, "Alright. What are the terms?"


Gianna's expression lit up with anticipation."Whoever loses has to stand in front of everyone, declare herself an idiot, and jog around the hall yelling it for all to hear.Agree?"


Her words practically dripped with anticipation-she could already picture her victory.


Nothing delighted Gianna more than the thought of humiliating Grace, and she planned to film every humiliating second for the school to see.


Julia's brows pinched together. "Gianna, there's no reason for family to place silly bets."


Gianna's smile became strained. Did Julia actually think Grace couldn't withstand a little embarrassment?



That tiny protest only made Gianna more eager to prove her point.


Determined not to let her mother worry, Grace gave Julia's shoulder a reassuring pat. "It's all right, Mom.Gianna wants a game. I'll play."


She met Gianna's stare, her voice steady. "Agreed.Let's keep it fair-no running away if you lose."
Doubt flickered in Julia's eyes. "Are you sure about this?"



Everyone in the family knew Gianna's reputation-her years spent examining gemstones had made her something of an expert.


Grace, on the other hand, had never even set foot in such circles until now.



Sensing the moment slipping away, Gianna jumped in before anyone could reconsider. "Absolutely, I accept the challenge. No way I'm backing out now."


There was little point in arguing, so Julia finally gave up,releasing a resigned sigh. The stage was set. The two girls focused on the glimmering piles of uncut stones, their friendly competition now in full swing.
###Chapter 53 Cutting Stones


Gianna brimmed with confidence, eager to prove her skill.


As she entered earlier, her sharp gaze swept over the booths until it landed on an uncut stone nearby. Its smooth surface bore a faint green hue-subtle but enough to suggest high-quality jade to a trained eye.


Pleased, she walked over and lightly ran her fingers across the stone, eyes glittering with pride and certainty.


"This is the one!" she announced confidently. "Sir,how much is it?"


The seller beamed. "Young lady, you've got a sharp eye. This is the crown jewel of my booth-priced flat at $500,000."


Gianna nodded without hesitation and made the payment.


She glanced sideways at Grace. "Grace, be sure to choose wisely. I'd hate to see you lose too badly."


She sneered inwardly. Grace challenging her was nothing more than wishful thinking.
Unbothered by the jab, Grace smiled faintly and wandered casually between the booths, her gaze moving steadily over each uncut stone, composed and unhurried.



Julia stood nearby, her expression tinged with concern as she watched Grace. She feared her daughter might end up at a loss.


After all, Gianna had grown up surrounded by gemstones-her eye was sharp, her judgment reliable.



"Grace,do you want me to help you look?" Julia asked gently.



Grace shook her head, a soft smile curving her lips."It's alright, Mom. I'll choose for myself."


Gianna snorted. "Aunt Julia, there's no need to worry.Since Grace dares to bet, she must think she has some talent,right?"


Grace said nothing, her gaze now fixed on a rough,unremarkable stone. Its surface was cracked and weathered, completely lacking any outward sign of jade.


"I'll take this one," she said, pointing to it.


Gianna blinked, then burst out laughing. "Are you serious? That thing looks like trash from the roadside.
Are you picking the worst one on purpose so you'll have an excuse when you lose?"


The onlookers began murmuring in amusement.


"Even blindfolded, you'd pick better than that."


"Is she out of her mind? That thing's worthless."



"She's definitely going to lose."


Grace remained calm. "Luck plays the biggest role.How can you be so sure this one has nothing inside?"


Gianna chuckled, amused. "Fine. If that's your choice,don't say I didn't warn you."



After Grace paid for her stone, both women waited as the seller prepared to cut them.



After starting the stone-cutting machine, the seller expertly cleaned the stones.



Everyone's attention was drawn to Gianna's uncut stone, which was the first thing put on the machine.



As the blade sliced through, a vibrant green shimmer appeared beneath the outer shell, drawing gasps from the crowd.



"It's jade! She has a sharp eye-she picked out high-quality jade with just a glance!" someone exclaimed
from the crowd.


"Yeah, unbelievable. What incredible luck!"


Gianna lifted her chin proudly, her smile radiant under the praise.


"Young lady, stop the cutting! I'll give you $1,000,000for it right now," someone offered eagerly.


Gianna responded with a gracious smile. "Sorry,I'm in the middle of a bet. But if you'd like,I can help you pick one later."


Grace's voice was calm and composed. "Gianna, since someone's willing to pay that much, maybe you should take the deal. Ever heard the saying, 'All that glitters is not gold'? It might just be limestone inside."



Gianna's expression tightened, her temper flaring.Was Grace jinxing her? Pressing her lips together, she replied curtly, "Save your concern. The result is already obvious."



With that, she gestured for the seller to continue cutting. She was determined to crush Grace's confidence.



The seller resumed, carefully guiding the blade through the heart of the stone.


But as the machine cut deeper, the vivid green began
to fade,replaced by a dull grayish-white. Veins of fibrous impurities snaked through the core,reducing the once-promising jade to rubble.



Gasps echoed through the crowd.


"How... how is this possible?" Gianna's eyes widened,her face draining of color.


Disappointed murmurs rippled around her. "What a shame. The outer layer looked amazing, but the inside's full of cracks and impurities. Totally worthless!"



The man who had offered to buy it sighed in relief."Lucky I didn't seal the deal. You can't even make a proper bracelet out of that-just a few cheap pendants."


Gianna stood frozen, her whole body trembling. Her fingers clenched into fists, nails biting into her palms.She was shocked to learn that the jade in her carefully selected stone was of such poor quality!



Grace gave a quiet sigh, her tone gentle but steady."I did warn you, Gianna."



Gianna snapped her head up, eyes burning. "Don't pretend! You just got lucky. That garbage you picked must be even worse!"



Grace remained serene, unaffected by the jab. She turned to the seller. "Sir, please cut mine next."
The man nodded and began securing the rough,unimpressive stone.




Around them, interest had all but vanished. A few people even turned to leave.




Even Gianna's possible stone had failed, after all.What is there to gain from this useless piece?
###Chapter 54 Going Through With The Bet



Gianna was seething with frustration. She had spent 500, 000 on that raw stone, only to end up with a few worthless shards. It was an absolute disappointment.


Still, she clung to the belief that Grace wouldn't fare any better.


Grace looked over at her and said calmly, "Gianna, it's not too late to admit defeat and apologize. Once my stone is cut open and revealed, you might really regret it."


"No,I want to see this through to the end. Your stone hasn't even been cut. What makes you so sure you'll come out on top?" Gianna shot back, eyes narrowing.


She simply couldn't believe Grace could be that lucky,especially when her own premium-quality stone had yielded nothing.


Grace didn't bother replying. She had already extended an olive branch, and Gianna had slapped it away. In that case, she decided to keep things direct from here on out.

After all, she had years of experience in stone
gambling and was confident in her skills.


Close by, the seller began grinding and polishing the stone.



The first cut sent some debris into the air, but what lay beneath was nothing more than a dull gray surface.


No one looked surprised. It was almost as if they had already expected this outcome.



Gianna sneered inwardly, "What a show-off."


Julia was anxious. She worried her daughter would be disappointed if she didn't win.


But Grace stayed composed. "Sir, please try cutting it again from another angle."


The man followed her instructions and made the second cut.



"My God!" he suddenly cried, hands beginning to tremble.



This time, the texture of the stone was completely different-dense and firm, not brittle at all.


From the freshly cut surface, a rich, luminous green light shined. The texture was immaculate, and the color was vivid and consistent. It was top-grade jadeite, the crown jewel of the jade world, famed for
its intense emerald hue and prized beyond measure.



The crowd exploded in a collective gasp of astonishment.



"This translucency! This color! In thirty years of collecting jade, I have never laid eyes on something this divine!"



"Look at that! The green changes with the light. It's mesmerizing!"



"Heavens above! How could a stone so plain on the outside hide something this extraordinary? It defies belief."



"Seriously, is that even real?"



"I would bet my reputation on it. It's the real deal."


In a heartbeat, jewelers pushed forward, their voices rising in a chaotic chorus of bids.


"Thirty million! Sell it to me, young lady!"


"I'll give you fifty million. I'll pay in cash right now!"


The scene erupted into chaos as the crowd surged with excitement.


The seller was practically kicking himself in regret,never in his wildest dreams expecting that the most
overlooked stone in his entire collection would produce such a treasure.



It was,without a doubt, the finest piece his humble booth had ever seen.



Grace's luck was nothing short of astonishing.


His gaze shifted to Grace, taking in her calm expression and eyes clear as crystal, brimming with quiet confidence. Despite her youth, there was something undeniably commanding about her presence. Though a pang of envy twisted in his chest,he still managed a gracious smile and said,"Congratulations to this young lady for uncovering a top-grade jadeite."



Naturally, he didn't miss the chance to turn the spotlight back on his booth, eyes gleaming with the hope that others would now rush to buy.


Gianna stood frozen, her expression blank with disbelief. She staggered back a few paces, eyes wide.


Then, staring at the luminous jadeite, she suddenly rushed forward, her voice rising in panic. "No way! This has to be fake! You cheated!"



Grace firmly grasped Gianna's wrist, her expression hardening. "Gianna, once you make a bet, you accept the result."
Gianna glared at her and asked, "Did you do this intentionally?"



A faint, unreadable smile curved across Grace's lips."You're giving me far too much credit. I was just lucky."


Lucky? That single word was enough to make Gianna's blood boil. She had thought thesame once,but now,watching Grace so composed, she couldn't help but admit that Grace knew what she was doing. How else could she have chosen the most unremarkable-looking stone and revealed such a stunning jadeite?Without some real skill up her sleeve, how could she possibly pull this off? Could she have been set up from the start?



The more Gianna thought about it, the more her anger festered.



"Do you remember our bet? Surely you are not thinking of backing out now?" Grace asked calmly


Gianna felt a knot rise in her throat.


Grace wanted to see her utterly humiliated.


But the bet had been made publicly. If she went back on her word now, what would everyone think of her?She was well and truly caught between a rock and a hard place.
She glanced toward Julia, silently begging her to tell Grace itwas all just a joke and that she shouldn't take it seriously. But Julia only met her gaze and stayed silent.



Grace saw right through her thoughts.



"What's the matter? Can't handle losing? You don't really think this bet was a joke, do you? Your fierce attitude earlier didn't look like one."



Gianna's cheeks flamed red. "So, what exactly do you want?"



"Own up to your loss. Since you made the terms,run around the venue shouting that you are an idiot,"Grace replied flatly.



Backed into a corner with no escape in sight, Gianna had no choice but to go through with it. All eyes locked onto her as if she were some rare creature on display at the zoo. She wanted the earth to open up and swallow her whole. Never in her life had she felt such bone-deep humiliation.



She vowed deep down that she would find a way to settle the score.
###Chapter 55 The Way He Looked At Her



The scene brought a grin to Julia's face. Of course,she wasn't oblivious-she saw straight through Gianna's petty little games.


All those years spent under Ethel's influence, and Gianna still hadn't learned better.


Thankfully,Grace wasn't so easily bullied.


The crowd finally quieted, the commotion fading.



The seller stared,awestruck, at the brilliant gemstone,rubbing his hands eagerly. "Name your price, young lady. Highest bidder takes it."



He didn't dare name a figure himself-not after someone had just offered fifty million.


Grace remained calm, her voice even. "I'm not selling.I'm keeping this piece for custom jewelry. It's for my mom."



She turned to Julia with a soft smile. "Hope you'll like it."



Julia's eyes lit up in surprise. "For me?"
"Of course."


A bright, heartfelt smile bloomed across Julia's face.
"A gift from my baby girl? I love it already."


That warm, genuine moment didn't go unnoticed.


Colton and Ryan just so happened to arrive across the exhibition hall in time to see the conversation.


Ryan's jaw dropped. "Wait a second... isn't that the girl who treated you? The one with those insane medical skills?"



He hadn't expected to run into her again. This girl never failed to surprise him. His curiosity kicked in instantly.


Colton shot him a sidelong look, voice flat. "Quit staring like that. You look like a creep."


Ryan scoffed, entirely unbothered. "Creep? That's what we call admiration,buddy."


Colton ignored him, but his eyes were drawn back to Grace.



She stood by a gemstone artisan, calmly discussing design ideas. The soft lighting outlined her profile-elegant, composed, and quietly radiant.


Ryan let out a low whistle. "Damn... beauty, brains,
and now she's maste about gemstones too? I'm officially intrigued. Who is she,really?"



There was no way a girl like that was ordinary.


Colton finally looked away, his voice cool. "Who she is... has nothing to do with you."


Ryan smirked. "Oho... now that sounded personal."


The glare Colton shot him could've frozen fire.Ryan quickly zipped his lips, but the sparkle in his eyes didn't fade.



Just then, as if sensing the attention, Grace looked up -and her gaze met Colton's. She paused, then offered a polite nod.



Ryan grabbed Colton's arm with a burst of energy."She saw me! Bro, be honest-how's my hair? Did I mess it up?"



Disgusted, Colton pushed his hand away. "Pathetic."


Meanwhile, Grace finalized her design with the gemstone artisan.



Julia watched as her daughter skillfully discussed intricate details, a swell of pride rising in her chest. In that moment, she realized-she didn't truly know everything about Grace.
Grace was full of surprises. She felt lucky to be her mom.



Unable to hold back her curiosity, she asked, "When did you learn all this?"



Grace paused a beat, then answered lighty,"Picked up a few things from a master craftsman."



What she didn't mention was that the so-called "master" was a reclusive legend in the gemstone world-and she had been his only student.


Her phone chimed at that moment. A call from Ethel.


Julia sighed. "Looks like Gianna made it home."


After losing the bet, Gianna had stormed off in a fury.



Grace handed the completed sketch to the artisan and gently wrapped an arm around her mother. "Come on,Mom. Let's go back."



As they passed by, Grace slowed just a little as they neared Colton and Ryan.


Ryan jumped at the chance, flashing a wide grin."Fancy running into you here, Miss Miller."


Grace returned a polite smile and greeted them.


Colton gave Julia a subtle nod of greeting.
Ryan leaned in, tone light but sincere. "You've got a real gift for picking jade, Miss Miller. Maybe you could help me out next time?"



He was dying to know more. The way Colton looked at her... it wasn't normal.


The infamous Colton Pearson-cold, distant,untouchable.Women never got close. People had even started speculating about his preferences... But now Ryan had ammunition to put those rumors to rest.


Without a word, Colton stepped forward, subtly positioning himself between Grace and Ryan.



"If there's time," Grace said evenly. Her eyes lifted-and locked with Colton's. There was something in his gaze. A quiet intensity that made her heart skip, just for a moment.


"Grace, let's go," Julia called gently.



Grace turned away, the moment sipping by, and disappeared into the crowd with her mother. Ryan rubbed his chin, grinning widely. "Colton...something's definitely going on with you."



Colton's expression remained unreadable. "We're leaving."



His recovery had been far quicker than anyone
expected. But most people still thought he was dying -especially his uncle Harry. And judging by Harry's recent moves... he was getting bold. Maybe it was time to surprise him.



Ryan trailed after Colton. "Hey, weren't we checking out those new stones?"



Colton didn't break stride. "You seem restless.Maybe I'll send you to that remote project nobody wants."



Ryan froze and zipped his mouth shut, miming surrender.



Meanwhile, at the Holden estate, Gianna knelt before Ethel, tears glistening in her eyes. "Grace humiliated me in front of everyone...she forced me to-"



Ethel's face darkened, her cane slamming hard against the marble. "Outrageous! How dare she?"
###Chapter 56 Coffee Party



Grace entered the grand hall alongside Julia,immediately feeling the cold,judging stare from Ethel.


"Both of you, get down on your knees now!" shouted Ethel, her voice edged sharply with anger.


Julia opened her mouth to reply, but Grace gently took her mother's hand and stepped forward with quiet confidence. "Grandma, could you tell me exactly whatI've done to upset you?"


A brief glance toward Gianna's self-satisfied face confirmed Grace's suspicions-another twisted tale must have reached Ethel's ears.



"You still dare to ask me?" Ethel asked,pointing directly at Gianna. "You openly humiliated her in front of everyone!"



Grace's eyes fell on Gianna's reddened face, and she gave a knowing smile. "Oh, you're referring to the bet,aren't you?"


She moved closer to Gianna, lowering her voice to a whisper. "Did you conveniently forget who suggested that bet first, and who-"
"Stop this nonsense immediately!" Ethel's stern voice sliced through Grace's words. "Publicly embarrassing Gianna was unacceptable!"


Julia's brows knitted softly as she turned to Gianna."Tell me honestly,Gianna.Did Grace force your hand?Everyone saw what truly happened. How could you twist things like this?"


Disappointment colored every word Julia spoke.Gianna had always been a lovely and kind girl in Julia's memory. She adored Gianna's sweetness, showering her with endless gifts and affection.



Even after Grace arrived, Julia's warmth toward Gianna remained unchanged.


Still, it caught her completely off guard that Gianna would twist the truth so boldly about what really went down at the Aurora Gem Fair.



Gianna's cheeks drained of color as she stammered,unable to meet Julia's gaze. "Aunt Julia, I-I didn't mean to make it sound that way."


She dropped her eyes, guilt evident in every shifting glance.



Ethel said coldly, "Julia,stop blindly defending Grace."


Julia smiled softly, her tone gentle yet firm. "I'm not
blindly defending anyone. Everything has to be judged fairly.If Grace truly mistreated Gianna, I would step in.But I won't let Gianna twist the truth to harm Grace,either."



EtheI's frown deepened, her gaze shifting uncertainly between Gianna's guilty look and Grace's steady calmness.



Realization gradually dawned on her.


Pressing a hand to her temple, Ethel said with a strained voice, "Fine. Since that's settled, you all should go now. I have a headache and need rest."


Julia and Grace respectfully withdrew, nodding politely as they exited.


Julia had come to realize that whenever she spent time with Ethel, their conversations always left Ethel nursing a headache. Maybe the truth was that the two of them simply didn't mix welL. Maybe she should limit her visits, for everyone's peace of mind.



Outside,Julia glanced at Grace with concern. "Are you upset,Grace?"



Grace shook her head gently. "I'm fine. It just bothers me that you're dragged into these conflicts because of me."



She wondered silently if she somehow attracted
women with dishonesty and manipulation wherever she went.


Julia laughed lightly, her eyes kind. "It's nothing new to me."


She'd grown accustomed to Ethel's perpetual disapproval, unaffected by it.


Julia was sincere and trusting-perhaps too trusting,considering she still fell for Ethel's fake headaches.


"Oh, Grace, there's a coffee party tomorrow," said Julia, shifting topics cheerfully. "Come along."


Grace nodded enthusiastically. "Of course, Mom."







On the third day, Grace slipped into a pale green dress chosen by Julia, highlighting her delicate features and graceful posture.



With a pleased nod, Julia said, "Grace, you're stunning today. There's no doubt you'll steal the spotlight at the event."



Julia herself wore an exquisite dark green dress adorned with floral embroidery, complemented perfectly by a strand of gleaming pearls, radiating elegance.
Linking arms with Grace affectionately, she teased lightly, "Look at us matching today."


The event was an occasion for wealthy ladies like Julia to socialize and strengthen connections over coffee.


They arrived at the renowned Majestic Winery, a prestigious coffeehouse owned by Julia's close friend,Lois Ramirez, known for its sophistication and tranquil ambiance.



Clusters of elegantly dressed ladies filled the space,sipping their drinks and murmuring in pleasant conversation.



The moment Grace and Julia entered, their presence immediately attracted attention.



"Julia, you've finally arrived!" Lois greeted warmly,linking arms with Julia and regarding Grace admiringly."And you must be Grace! You're even more charming in person than your photos suggest."



Grace responded politely with a graceful nod, "It's lovely to meet you, Mrs. Ramirez."


Lois smiled brightly, leading them further into the venue. "Come, let's introduce you around."



Curious whispers filled the room, acknowledging Grace's significance based on Lois's warm welcome.
Just then, a voice emerged from behind them,surprised yet intrigued. "Myla! Good to see you.And who is this charming young woman you've brought along?"
###Chapter 57 Determined To Outshine Grace



A new guest stepped into the gathering, drawing immediate interest from the crowd.



The Dixon family had long been one of the city's most respected names, and Myla Dixon stood out for her effortless charm in social settings.



She walked in gracefully, linking arms with a younger girl and greeting the room with a warm smile. "This is Demi Miller, the daughter of a close friend.I thought it was time she got acquaintedwith our circles."



Demi wore a rose-red dress that stood out boldly among the muted tones around her. Her makeup was flawlessly applied, and there was a quiet confidence in the way she carried herself.



With her chin slightly lifted, she scanned the room calmly. Then her eyes landed on Grace. Her pupils shrank in surprise, and a faint crease formed between her brows. Why was Grace here?



Demi's lips thinned, and her fingers curled into her palms before she noticed. She hadn't come all this way just to be upstaged.
Since crossing paths with Marvin Dixon, Myla's son,she had devoted herself to fitting the image the Dixons admired-spending months mastering the art of brewing artisan coffee.



Now, with the Millers and Dixons working closely together,her engagement to Marvin was almost within reach.



Today, Myla had brought her along to help ease her into society, a crucial move if she were to marry Marvin.



Lois greeted them graciously. "Myla, what a lovely surprise.And Miss Miller,you carry yourself beautifully."



Myla gave a soft laugh, waving off the compliment."You're too kind. She's a little reserved, so I thought it best to let her get used to the environment."



Then,with an almost casual tone, she turned toward Julia. "I heard Mrs. Holden recently took in a daughter.What a heartwarming update."



Her expression remained pleasant, but her eyes shifted slightly, a fleeting sharpness behind the smile.



There was history between them. Myla had been smitten with Rodger the moment she met him,convinced he was the one she would marry.Her parents had encouraged it, viewing the Holden name
as a valuable connection in the upper circles. Ethel,too,had seen the potential in a union between their families.



However, Rodger had felt nothing for Myla. He defied every expectation and chose Julia instead, a woman without wealth or pedigree.



Everyone knew how deeply he loved her.



Although Julia was in her forties, she carried the glow and vitality of someone ten years younger, poof of how deeply Rodger's affection had nurtured her.


This,more than anything, unsettled Myla. Seeing Julia stirred old bitterness that had never quite faded.


Her own marriage had been arranged for convenience,not love. After giving birth, her husband had drifted away.He now lived elsewhere and rarely visited.


What gave her leverage, was her son. That alone earned her some respect.



When word got out that Julia had adopted a girl from an orphanage, Myla couldn't help slipping in a cutting remark.



Julia's expression remained serene. "I appreciate your interest, Mrs. Dixon."



Then Myla spoke again. "I heard she was raised in an
orphanage. You must share a special bond."


"That's true. I treasure Grace deeply," Julia said without pause.



A short distance away, Demi picked up on the subtle tension.



She gave an innocent blink. "Grace? I didn't expect to see you here! I didn't realize you were into coffee culture too."



The air shifted. Conversations stopped.



Grace responded with poise, her smile calm. "I am.And it must have been challenging for you to pick it up so suddenly."


Though the words were polite, Demi caught the sting beneath them. Her fists tightened at her sides.She wasn't going to let that pass. Not today.



Grace was determined to outshine Grace and put her where she belonged.



Around them, the other women remained quiet,but not oblivious. Whispers had long suggested that the Dixons were planning a deeper alliance with the Millers.



Now that their families were working together,a formal union felt inevitable.
The Millers had only recently climbed into the city's elite, and an arrangement with the Dixons would seal their place.



No one spoke of it openly, of course. But every guest there knew exactly what was unfolding, they just played along.



At that moment, Lois spoke up with a cheerful tone."Ladies, the spring roast is ready. Let's take our seats and enjoy a tasting,shall we?"



The guests began settling down, each finding their place in front of a carefully arranged coffee set.


It wouldn't be long before someone was called upon to demonstrate.



For Demi, this marked her first experience in such a setting, and the excitement was hard to contain.



The Mliller name had only recently begun to gain recognition, unlike the long-established lineages of the others present.


In the past, she never had access to gatherings like this. Today, it was the Dixon family's reputation that had opened the door.


Lately, she'd immersed herself in coffee brewing and floral arts, determined to leave a strong impression.
Today, she'd like to make sure Grace saw the difference between them.



Just then, Myla turned to Lois with a light suggestion."Lois, perhaps it's time the younger ones share what they've been learning. Demi's been training with a top barista lately."



"That sounds lovely! Please, go ahead," Lois replied with enthusiasm.



Demi lifted her chin slightly, her smile composed as she rose from her seat. Moving with practiced grace,she stepped up to the demonstration table, ready to display her technique.
###Chapter 58 An Surprise



For this occasion, Demi put her skills to the test,relying on the signature brewing method she'd spent a small fortune mastering under a world-renowned barista.



Careful selection led her to her prized espresso machine,every movement slowed for precision and effect.



Raising her voice just enough to command attention,she displayed the beans with a flourish. "This is Kopi Luwak," Demi declared. "It's one of the rarest and most expensive coffees in the world. And Marvin managed to snag these just for me."


Among the society women, a few exchanged knowing looks, each understanding the rarity behind such beans. The engagement between Demi and Marvin was all but set in stone.



A subtle glance at Grace revealed her sitting quietly,which filled Demi with an unexpected rush of satisfaction. Did Grace feel outshone? Perhaps she'd finally learned when to stay out of the spotlight.


As she poured, Demi made sure to slow her hand, the dazzling glint of her Patek Philippe watch drawing just
as much attention as the ritual itself-a sparkling half -million dollar statement.



Demi continued in a velvety voice, "In order to bring out the best..."



Soon,a decadent aroma wafted through the air.


Polite nods rippled among the ladies, while Myla's expression shifted to one of clear approval. It was hard to deny that Demi's performance left a strong impression. Initially, her reservations about Demi's background lingered. The Miller family was nouveau riche, hardly a name with generations of standing,and she'd feared that lack of pedigree would drag down the Dixon family.


However, recent days have proven Demi to be surprisingly accomplished.


With one graceful twist of her wrist, she'd poured the coffee into Myla's cup. As she added the creamy froth,a beautiful pattern began to emerge. With a quick flick, she coaxed a flawless heart at the center,surrounded by delicate swirls that created an intricate floral design.



"Incredible! Just look at that art!"



"She really does have talent."



The room buzzed with praise.
Turning to Grace, Myla smiled with a hint of challenge."Miss Miller, care to give it a try? I must caution you,though-these beans are extremely rare. A single mistake, and they're ruined..."


Dozens of eyes settled on Grace, waiting for her response.


A slight frown creased Julia's brow at Myla's pointed remark. Why would Myla single out Grace in front of all these well-heeled guests? Among so many young women,choosing her own daughter as the center of attention felt oddly pointed.


From Julia's perspective, Myla's attitude bordered on outright hostility toward Grace.


Today was supposed to be about exposure-Julia had only brought Grace to help her gain some experience in elite circles.


Since Julia had never once seen Grace prepare coffee,she leaned over and whispered, "Don't let her get to you.Just ignore whatever she says."


With a lighthearted laugh,Grace squeezed Julia's hand,then stood to face the challenge. "I'm certainly no professional," she announced warmly, "so I'll use ordinary beans instead."


An incredulous smile threatened to break across
Demi's face.



Ordinary beans, here? She could hardly wait to see Grace embarrass herself.



Yet,moments later, the room slipped into stunned silence.



With a calm confidence, Grace set out a handful of unremarkable beans. Her motions, however, were so fluid and practiced that even Demi's earlier display seemed forced by comparison.


No fancy machines accompanied her, onlya simple French press stood on the table. Grace poured with a smooth finesse, and the hot water glided over the grounds,causing them to blossom and rise in flawless unison.


A breathtaking sight unfolded as she expertly poured frothed milk into the cup. With a graceful swirl, she created a base layer over the rich espresso,and then began to sculpt an adorable 3D bear. With precise movements, she shaped the head and ears, adding tiny white mounds for eyes and a small dot for the nose.


From the doorway, a voice broke through the amazement. "That's amazing! It's 3D latte art."


Heads turned instantly.
An elderly man with silver hair entered at a measured pace, an attendant trailing behind with an elegant case in hand.


Excited whispers rippled through the crowd. "It's Elliot Natt-the Coffee Legend himself!"


Within the world of coffee,few names carried more weight than Elliot's. Public sightings were rare, making this appearance something of a myth come true.


Lois could hardly contain her joy. To have Elliot join their gathering felt like a rare privilege, something far beyond what she had hoped for.


She had sent out invitation after invitation, each one filled with the hope that the maestro would finally agree. She longed for him to bring his brilliance into their midst, to lift their gatherings into something far more refined.



But Elliot always had too much on his plate, and there was never a moment he could spare to show up.


The sight of him walking in, unannounced and unhurried, stirred a rush of delight-it was the kind of surprise no one saw coming, yet everyone welcomed.


"What an honor, Mr. Natt! Welcome!"


Elliot offered a warm nod to the assembled guests,his
searching gaze finally settling on Grace. Recognition sparked instantly in his eyes. "Young lady! I haven't forgotten your artistry, the 3D latte art you showed last time is still vivid in my mind!"


A collective gasp swept through the crowd.


Springing to her feet, Grace offered a polite greeting."Good afternoon,Mr.Natt."


A hearty laugh bubbled from Elliot as he turned and told everyone, "Let me tell you, her skill with coffee could humble even a veteran like myself. I even brought my antique espresso set, hoping we might convince her to share another demonstration with us."


Whispers of disbelief rippled across the room. Such quiet brilliance from Grace had caught everyone off guard.


Curiosity soon won out, and guests crowded forward to sample the brew she'd just made, eager to see if the taste matched Elliot's glowing endorsement.


One sip was all it took; praise began to circulate, soft and awed.



For the first time,even Myla found herself conceding.Those humble beans, transformed by Grace's hand,held an intensity and bouquet that far surpassed even the celebrated Kopi Luwak. What Grace achieved bordered on miraculous.
Irritation flickered across Myla's features. The revelation that Julia's adopted daughter, this quiet,unusual girl, possessed such extraordinary talent was hard to stomach.



Meanwhile, Demi lingered off to the side, her complexion ashen.



Her well-rehearsed techniques and expensive training felt suddenly amateurish-almost laughable next to Grace's effortless command.



What unsettled Demi even more was witnessing the easy rapport between Grace and Elliot, the undisputed luminary of their coffee-loving world.



Where could they have crossed paths? Wasn't Grace supposed to be an adopted child with no particular ties or privileges? How had she managed to develop such refined skills?



Across the room, Julia looked at Grace, her heart swelling with joy.


Each day, her remarkable daughter managed to surprise her all over again.
###Chapter 59 Eliana's Diagnosis



Originally, Julia had attended the event to give her daughter a taste of the wider world, but the evening flipped expectations-everyone else walked away humbled.



Grace's reputation	underwent a	dramatic

transformation.



Few had ever imagined that Julia would welcome someone so remarkable into her family.


For many, the experience shattered old assumptions.


Even back at home, Julia found herself questioning if any of it had truly happened.


Grace felt almost too extraordinary to be real.


Later that night, Rodger returned, only to be swept up in Julia's animated retelling, her excitement impossible to contain.



Although Rodger prided himself on staying calm and collected, he had to confess-even he had underestimated Grace's talents.
The following morning, a quiet breakfast was interrupted by a sudden call from the Holden estate.



The urgency in the butler's voice was impossible to ignore. Clearly, something was very wrong.


Breakfast ended in a rush as the family scrambled to the estate.



Stepping into the living room, they were met with a thick,almost tangible sense of dread.



Eliana sat motionless on the couch, eyes swollen and lost in thought. Anyone could see she was in distress.


Rodger's concern took over as he hurried to her side."Eliana, are you all right? You look so pale."


As soon as she heard him, Eliana dissolved into tears,unable to hold back any longer.


"Rodger... I... I'm dying... It's stomach cancer. The doctors say it's late stage!"


A heavy silence filled the room, disbelief etching itself onto every face.


The unthinkable had happened; Grace's warning had come true.



Eliana's condition was as dire as Grace had once said.
The news hit Rodger so hard he had to steady himself,the shock nearly knocking him off balance.


Without hesitation, Julia rushed to Eliana's side, her hands trembling as she tried to steady her. "How could this be possible? Did the doctors actually confirm it?"


Tears streaming down her face, Eliana pulled a bundle of medical papers from her bag. "It showed up in my latest check-up... The doctor warned me...it's already spreading everywhere..."


Her fingers trembled as she pointed to the ominous shadows on the CT scan report-there was no denying the dark shapes. "Without immediate treatment,they said I might not have more than a few months..."


Claire dropped to her knees, clutching her mother's hand in disbelief. "No, Mom, that can't be true! You don't have cancer... I refuse to believe it!"


Her entire body quivered, barely holding herself together. The thought of losing her mother left her frozen with fear, unable to imagine what tomorrow might bring.


From the very start, the Robertson family had never fully embraced her. After Claire was born, Eliana's health never recovered, and her dreams of another child slipped away.
Every specialist she'd seen offered nothing but disappointment. Yet, her husband longed for a son to carry their name. As years passed, he slowly disappeared from their lives, hardly ever coming home or acknowledging her and Claire.


Hushed voices always lingered behind Eliana's back,but she forced herself to ignore the gossip and soldier on.



There was nothing she could do to change things-and revealing her broken marriage to her own family was out of the question. Pride ran deep in every Holden. Becoming a family punchline was never an option.



Back then, the weight of her secrets nearly crushed her. She found herself seeking solace in drink, night after night. Maybe that was what truly broke her health.



For years, she kept up a flawless image, smiling through the pain, never letting anyone glimpse the sadness inside.



Now, faced with this diagnosis, the mnask was slipping away for good.



A heavy silence pressed down on everyone in the room.
Ethel's knuckles turned white as she gripped her cane,her face drained of all color.



Rodger managed to gather himself first, saying in a steady, reassuring tone, "Eliana, don't give up hope.I'll find the finest doctors across the country. We'll fight this together."


A defeated look crossed Eliana's face as she shook her head. "It's no use, Rodger. The reports don't lie-it's already advanced. I've seen every leading specialist I could find... They all said the same thing.There's little hope left for me."



Returning to Ethel's side had only one goal in her mind:to carve out a brighter path for Claire's future. Nothing else held any real importance for her anymore.



All hope had faded from her heart long ago.


Without missing a beat, Julia wrapped her in reassurance. "Eliana, don't let despair get the best of you. Treatments have advanced so much-if things don't work out here, we'll seek help overseas. I have connections with Dr. Jerry Morrison. He's recognized everywhere as a leader in oncology."



"No," said Grace, her tone unwavering and honest."Dr.Jerry Morrison might be famous, but he can't reverse this."
At that, Gianna pounced, her voice edged with accusation. "Dr. Morrison's reputation is second to none. So you're saying Aunt Eliana's situation is hopeless?"



Those words dripped with malice, setting the room on edge. Sure enough, Claire's anger boiled over. She shot upright, stabbing a finger at Grace, her voice shaking with fury. "Grace, what's wrong with you? you are so vicious. How could you wish this on my mother?"


Darkness swept over Julia's features, her patience running thin. Rodger, too, stiffened,worry clouding his face.



"Claire, that's enough," Julia said, her words slicing through the chaos. "If anyone dares insult my daughter again-no matter who it is-we'll walk away from all of this. We're here to support each other, not to tear anyone down."


Standing up for what mattered most, Julia never hesitated when it came to protecting her own.



To her, Grace was irreplaceable; she would never stand by and let others hurl insults at her. Besides,Grace had spoken nothing but the truth. If not for her,Eliana might still be in the dark about her illness.



Strangely, Grace's good intentions had only earned her scorn.
Julia had always looked the other way out of compassion for Eliana and understanding of Rodger's family ties, but Claire had crossed an unspoken line.




Humiliation directed at Grace would never be tolerated. Not a single sound echoed through the room as Julia's anger settled over them.




Known for her warmth, Julia rarely raised her voice.Now,though,her fierce defense left everyone feeling small.
###Chapter 60 Bragging


Eliana hurried to smooth things over. "Julia, please don't be upset. Claire spoke impulsively because she's worried about me. She meant no harm."


Secretly, though, she wvished Claire wouldn't always blurt out exactly what was on her mind without considering the consequences.


With lips pressed tightly, Grace studied Eliana before saying, "Dr. Morrison might not have answers for your illness, but don't lose hope. Someone else can."


At Grace's words, Eliana's face shifted. "Who could it possibly be?" The question escaped before she could stop it.


Was she being naive again? Why was she grasping at thin air? In her view, Grace had never shown herself to be reliable-what miracle solution could she possibly offer? Certainly, Grace had no connections to anyone capable or famous. Maybe the sickness was getting to her own head.



Nearby, Gianna's irritation bubbled over. "Grace,you aren't implying you're the miracle healer, are you? You genuinely believe you can cure Aunt Eliana's stomach cancer?"
"Actually, I am," Grace replied with quiet determination.



The room fell silent, as though caught in a cold grip.


Eliana felt the fragile spark of hope wvithin her flicker and vanish into a familiar ache of disappointment.


She forced herself into a bitter, weary smile. "Grace,please stop this nonsense..."


Claire,unable to contain herself any longer, sharply interjected, "Do you realize the kind of trouble your bragging could cause? Aren't you afraid of being caught in your own lies?"


Gianna's mouth twisted scornfully. To her, Grace had clearly lost her sense of reality, thinking she was superior to world-renowned experts. She had rarely seen anyone with such nerve.



Ethel's face was equally tense, disbelief etched deeply as Grace's claims grew more absurd.



Grace merely offered a small, calm smile. "It's your choice to believe or not."



Without another word, she turned and left.


Julia hurried after her, offering comfort.



While doubt filled the room, Julia remained
unwavering. After all, she'd personally experienced the extraordinary effects of the medicine Grace developed. She trusted implicitly in her daughter's honesty.



Confusion rippled among those left behind.


Rodger's brow creased slightly. He couldn't imagine Grace speaking without reason.


"Eliana, don't lose hope. I'll do everything I can to find someone who can truly help," he said gently, noticing the shadow on her face.



He recalled whispers about a mysterious healer named Dr. Q, reputed to defy death itself and conquer diseases thought unbeatable.



Finding Dr. Q was nearly impossible; the mysterious doctor never made any public appearances.


A sharp, disbelieving laugh slipped from Eliana."Dr.Q?" she said. "Rodger, that's just a story people like to whisper about..."


Without wavering, Rodger met her doubts with certainty. "I've already sent out investigators.Any clue at all, and we'll do whatever it takes to bring this doctor here for you."


"Alright." Eliana nodded, a smile flickering across her face though it didn't reach her eyes.
Unexpectedly,Gianna broke the quiet with a new idea."I came across something interesting-there's an auction this weekend. Supposedly, a miracle cure will be up for bid, claimed to heal any sickness and restore youth. An enigmatic healer created it, and the city's wealthy all line up for a chance at it. Maybe it's worth a look for Aunt Eliana?"


Ethel couldn't hide her excitement. "Seriously? We have to check it out!"



A brief silence followed as Rodger weighed the option."I'll assign someone to investigate the medicine. If it truly works, we'll secure it, whatever the price."


Claire's face lit up, her joy unmistakable. "You mean it?That's amazing. We really have totry!"



Every possible option needed exploring if there was any hope of easing her mother's illness.



That approach certainly sounded more promising than paying attention to Grace's bragging.


Meanwhile, Grace picked up her phone to find Patrick on the line. "Hi, I've got some exciting news. There's an auction coming up this weekend-rare medicinal treasures will be up for grabs, but the real star is our 'Rejuvenation Pill'. I've set aside two just for the auction. Interested? I managed to snag an invitation."
Gaining entry to events like this wasn't easy; only the select few with exclusive invites could hope to attend.


"Sounds good, I'll go have a look," she replied, not having any pressing plans for the weekend anyway.






Back at the hospital, Eliana relied on prescribed medications while Rodger's efforts remained focused on the elusive Dr. Q.



For her part, Grace stepped aside, letting them follow their own path. If her advice went unheeded, she saw no point in pressing further.


A different day found Grace scheduled for a house call to Colton's-her last check-up for him.



Progress from her earlier treatments had left Colton on the verge of full health.


Upon arrival, the butler received her with a deep bow."Miss Miller, Mr. Pearson is waiting for you."


She acknowledged him with a nod and made her way directly to his room.


There, Colton stood quietly at a window, posture commanding and gaze unreadable.


He turned as soon as he heard her approach, his
attention sharpening. "You've arrived."


Grace returned the look, her answer measured,replying, "Go ahead and lie down. This is your final follow-up."


With a subtle smile, Colton's tone dropped to a murmur."Are you really convincedI'm back to normal?"


One eyebrow arched, Grace shot him a teasing look."So,have you lost faith in my abilities?"


Colton's laughter was quiet, almost warm, as he settled back and let her begin her work.


With steady hands, she pressed her fingertips to his wrist, feeling for a steady rhythm. After a few thoughtful seconds, a smile played at her lips. "Your recovery is complete. Every trace of the toxin is gone."


A glimmer of mischief danced in Colton's eyes. Out of nowhere,he caught her wrist and grinned. "Grace,you've pulled me back from the edge. Any ideas on how I might repay you?"
###Chapter 61 Dining Together



Grace was momentarily caught off guard, then let out a soft chuckle, gracefully withdrawing her hand. "Mr.Pearson, you're too generous. Treating patients is simply a doctor's duty-and besides... you've already compensated me." Her tone remained light, but her eyes hinted that they'd covered this topic before.


Colton sat up straighter, his gaze unwavering. "That amount could never repay your kindness of saving my life."



Grace arched a brow. "Oh? Then how would you prefer to thank me?"



Colton leaned in without warning, his voice dipping into a velvety murmur. "How about I repay you by giving you my heart?" What do you think?"


Grace blinked, momentarily at a loss. She took a few steps back, her smile unreadable. "That's not a very funny joke."


Colton's expression didn't shift. "I never joke."


The air grew taut, a subtle tension humming between them.
Feeling the weight of it, Grace gently cleared her throat. "If you're truly feeling grateful, why not just treat me to a meal?"



In truth, she was getting a little hungry.



A faint smile tugged at Colton's lips, a glint of amusement flickering in his eyes. "Of course. What would you like?"



Grace considered it briefly. "I've heard that French restaurant on Maple Street has great reviews."



Without hesitation, Colton grabbed his coat. "Let's go,then."



She blinked, surprised by how quickly he moved,but followed nonetheless.


Soon, the car rolled to a stop in front of the French restaurant she mentioned.



The place exuded sophistication and exclusivity, its atmosphere rich with quiet elegance. Colton was clearly no stranger here-the manager himself appeared at the entrance, greeting them with respect before leading them to a private room.


Once seated, Grace flipped through the menu, her tone light as she remarked, "Seems like you're quite the regular here."
Colton replied casually, "Yeah, I drop by from time to time for business."



In truth, this particular gem belonged to Ryan, the man behind many of the city's finest dining establishments.He had a penchant for investing in the culinary world.Most of the top-rated restaurants bore his name behind the scenes.



Grace didn't hesitate to order several of the house specialties.


Colton watched her, a strange feeling stirring in his chest-one he couldn't quite name.


After placing her order, Grace passed the menu to the waiter, then glanced up to meet Colton's contemplative gaze. She lifted a brow slightly. "Mr.Pearson, are you looking at me because you disapprove of my choices?"


Colton tapped the table lightly with his fingers,his voice low and steady. "I'm wondering-who exactly are you?"


Even now, her identity remained a puzzle. Everything about her defied simple explanation. Strange, almost unbelievable things seemed to follow in her wake.


Grace let out a quiet chuckle. "Just an ordinary woman.

Nothing worth investigating."
"Is that so? Yet I find myself wanting to know more."His eyes were dark and searching.


She took a sip of juice, her voice calm, indifferent."Curiosity killed the cat. You might want to tread carefully."	1



Colton opened his mouth to respond, but the door to the private room swung open without warning.



A man in a casual suit stepped inside, wearing a roguish grin. "I saw your car downstairs and wondered who you were meeting. So this is a date?"



As he finished speaking, his gaze landed on Grace, and his expression shifted. His lips parted in surprise. "Miss Miller! A pleasure to finally meet you."


With effortless charm, Ryan pulled out a chair and sat down,as if he belonged there.



"A pleasure to meet you, too," Grace replied politely,her posture composed.


"Miss Miller, feel free to order anything you like.Today,it's all on me."


It seemed Colton was finally loosening up. Ryan almost felt emotional-like a proud elder brother witnessing personal growth. Colton had always been all work, untouched by romance. But now, he was
looking at Grace as if she were the only person in the world.



"Thank you," Grace said with a nod.


She had recognized him immediately-Ryan Clark,the famous restaurateur and Colton's childhood friend.



Colton frowned. "What are you doing here?"


Ryan leaned back with a smile, eyes twinkling as they flicked to Grace. "How could I miss the chance to treat Miss Miller properly?"



Grace offered a polite smile.


Ryan gave Colton a playful wink and raised his voice a little. "Colton, you've been holding out on me! You knew I wanted to meet her, yet you kept her to yourself?"


Colton's face darkened. "Ryan, you're talking too much."



As she observed their exchange, Grace couldn't help but chuckle quietly. The ambiance in the room was greatly lightened by her laughter.



"Don't mind him," Ryan said, pouring her a cup of coffee with practiced flair. "He's always been the quiet type. But bringing you here? That says something."
Colton shot him a warning glare. "Aren't you supposed to be busy?"



"Very busy!" Ryan waved dramatically. "But when I heard she was here, I just had to stop by and say hello."


He lowered his voice into a conspiratorial murmur."You know, Miss Miller, you're the first woman Colton's ever brought to this place."


Grace raised an amused brow in Colton's direction."Oh? Then I must be truly honored."


Colton cleared his throat, clearly uncomfortable."Ryan,don't you have work?"


"Alright, alright, I'm going." Ryan stood, brushing imaginary dust off his jacket. "I'll tell the kitchen to speed things up."



As he turned to leave, he gave Grace one last wink."Miss Miller, let's share a meal sometime. Just the two of us."



Colton took a slow sip of his coffee. "He's always been like that. Don't let it get to you."


Just then, the waiters arrived, carrying an array of elegantly plated dishes. The table quickly filled with the restaurant's finest offerings.
Grace picked up her fork and sampled one of the signature dishes. Her eyes lit up instantly. "The flavor is truly outstanding."



Colton watched her, the corners of his mouth lifting into a smile before he realized it. "If you like it, help yourself to more."



They continued their meal in comfortable silence,the atmosphere between them warm and unexpectedly peaceful.


As they were nearing the end of the meal, Grace's phone began to vibrate on the table.



She glanced at the screen, her expression tightening as a faint frown appeared. "Excuse me, I need to take this."



She stepped aside and answered the call. Rodger's anxious voice rushed through the speaker. "Grace, it's your aunt Eliana. Her condition just took a sudden turn.Can you get to the hospital right away?"
###Chapter 62 Doubts About Grace's Medical Skills



Grace's expression turned grave. "I'll be right there."


She swiftly reached for her coat. "Mr. Pearson, thank you for your hospitality, but something urgent has come up-I need to leave immediately."


Without missing a beat, Colton rose to his feet."I'll take you."


"Alright, thank you!" she replied,quickly following him out. As the car sped off, Grace sat in silence, her gaze fixed on the blur of the retreating scenery.In her mind,calculations turned rapidly-scenarios, symptoms,timelines.



She had examined Eliana briefly weeks ago. Half a month had passed since then. If her instincts were right, the malignant growth had likely advanced-its spread now a matter of time, not possibility.


Colton handled the car with controlled urgency, his driving smooth yet swift. Before Grace could fully gather her thoughts, they were already pulling into the hospital entrance.


He stole a glance at her. Her mind was clearly
elsewhere-focused,intense.


But Colton, ever the composed gentleman,chose not to pry. "We're here. Do you want me to come in with you?" His offer, spoken calmly, was rare and sincere.


"No, thank you." Grace gave a polite nod before stepping out and hurrying toward the hospital doors.


Colton watched her disappear into the building,his gaze lingering. Just then,his phone buzzed sharply.


An unfamiliar number flashed on the screen. His eyes narrowed, the coldness in them returning.







At the hospital, Grace arrived to find the emergency room entrance in chaos.



The place was crowded with members of the Holden family-relatives of Eliana.



"Grace,thank God you're here." Julia spotted her and rushed over, grasping her hand tightly.



"Eliana collapsed earlier today. They rushed her here,and now she's in the ER. The doctors say the tumor's grown too large and is beginning to spread.Surgery is urgent."



"They said it's risky. Her survival depends on what
happens next." Before Rodger could finish,Grace had already deduced the rest-her clinical mind filling in the missing pieces with chilling clarity.



Rodger silently nodded, realizing once again that bringing Grace had been the right call.


"Grace, Eliana's still inside. The doctors haven't said anything yet. Isn't it a bit much to make such assumptions now?" Gianna spoke up, her voice gentle on the surface, but her eyes sparkled with veiled malice. She clearly wanted others to believe Grace was bringing bad luck.



And sure enough, after hearing these words, Claire,who had been grieving, leaped to her feet and yelled,"Grace! How could you? My mom's fighting for her life,and you're already declaring doom! Are you even human?"



"This isn't a curse," Julia countered sharply, shielding her daughter. "Grace is simply telling the truth so everyone can be mentally prepared."



"Enough. This isn't the place for drama." Rodger stepped in, trying to keep things calm. "We should wait for the doctors."



"Dad, who's performing Aunt Eliana's surgery?" Grace cut in, her tone firm. "If you trust me, I can do it myself."
The tension in the air tightened.


Grace didn't waste time with pleasantries. A case this severe needed precision and expertise beyond what most doctors could offer.


In most hospitals, the odds of surviving such surgery were under ten percent. But with Grace in charge, the success rate would rise to over ninety.


"You?" Claire blinked, then barked out a laugh. "Did I hear that right? You think you can perform surgery?Are you serious?"


"Grace, this isn't a joke," Gianna added with a sneer,looking at her with blatant contempt. "You're not a doctor. Playing with someone's life isn't something you do just because you feel confident."



Did Grace really think anyone could just become a doctor and start performing surgeries? Even if she'd studied medicine, picking up a scalpel wasn't something that could be done casually or without rigorous training.


"Exactly! And Uncle Carl already invited the Master Healer,Kevin Chadwick, to handle the surgery. With him operating on my mother, there's nothing to worry about!" Clair declared smugly, her voice brimming with confidence.
Grace had never met Carl before. He had only just returned from abroad after learning about Eliana's critical condition.



To Claire, Carl was a man of action-someone who got results, unlike the people standing around wasting breath on empty words.


"I don't believe Grace is joking, nor would she ever treat something so serious lightly." Julia's voice rang out, calm yet firm. "She made a suggestion,that's all.Whether you accept it or not is your choice-but questioning her ability is stepping out of line. That judgment isn't yours to make."


Julia made a strong statement. She believed in her daughter without reservation. She'd known Grace for a short time, but she knew enough about her to know her in general.


And the pills Grace had given her had been a huge success. She was feeling much better, both physically and emotionally.


Despite the family's arguments, Rodger maintained his composure. Hurried footsteps echoed as he considered how to manage the situation objectively.


They all turned to see a man in a suit with rimless glasses and a man in a white coat.
This doctor was Kevin, the Master Healer, if they were not mistaken.
###Chapter 63 A Successful Surgery


"Dr. Chadwick, you're finally here! I've been waiting for you forever. Please, come quickly-my mother needs surgery right away. She's in critical condition!"Claire's eyes shimmered with tears of relief as she caught sight of Kevin. His arrival felt like grasping a lifeline after hours of drowning.


She was surrounded by relatives, yet none could offer the kind of help her mother desperately needed. Only a skilled doctor could turn things around, and Kevin's presence finally gave her a sliver of hope.


Claire and her mother had always leaned on each other. Her father hadn't even bothered to show up-not even when his wife's life hung by a thread. All because she hadn't given him a boy.



"I understand," Kevin said, his tone even but serious."But after reviewing Mrs. Robertson's case, I must be honest-her condition is extremely complicated.Even with my experience, the operation only has a fifty-fifty chance of success. Unless..."


Unless his mentor, the legendary Dr. Q, was here to assist.
Before he could finish, Claire cut in, her voice tight with urgency, "I believe in you. Even if there's just a fifty percent chance, it's still worth it-for my mom's life!"



To Claire, those odds were better than none. She'd rather fight with hope than stand by and lose her.



Afraid Kevin might second-guess his decision,she quickly added, her voice filled with emotion, "It means so much that you came. I know people wait over a year just to get an appointment with you. We're only this lucky because of my uncle Carl's persistence."



"Your uncle Carl?" Kevin repeated, then turned toward the man in question, his brows lifting slightly."I was invited by Mr. Rodger Holden. Your uncle Carl had nothing to do with it."



Kevin had a fair grasp of the Holden family's inner workings. Had it not been for a past favor from Rodger, he never would've made this special trip.


"What?" Claire blinked, clearly caught off guard.


"We're all family here. No need to get stuck on the details," Carl said with a forced chuckle, quickly trying to defuse the tension. "Let's focus on Eliana's treatment."



It was true-Rodger had contacted Kevin. But due to
business obligations, he'd sent Carl in his place.Claire's assumption had simply gone uncorrected.


A quiet,mocking chuckle slipped from Grace,who had remained silent until now.



Rumors about Carl weren't flattering-most called him incompetent and arrogant. Now, it seemed, he was also eager to bask in credit he hadn't earned.



"What are you laughing at?" Claire started.


Kevin's surprised and genuinely delighted voice cut her off. "Miss Miller! What a surprise-what brings you here?" He hadn't noticed her until that moment.


"The patient inside is my aunt," Grace replied,composed and steady.



"What? The patient is your aunt?" Kevin's eyebrows shot up.



Turning to Claire and the rest, he said with unmistakable certainty, "With my mentor here, there was no need to call me at all! She's more than capable of handling this surgery."



His statement stunned everyone into silence.


"Time is critical. Miss Miller, would you join me in the operating room?" Kevin asked, his eyes gleaming with excitement.
The thought of assisting his mentor in surgery electrified him. He was already glad he'd come.


"What? Dr. Chadwick, are you seriously letting Grace assist you?" Gianna asked, her voice thick with disbelief.


Kevin's expression turned cold. "I'm assisting her,not the other way around. Got it?"


Gianna stood frozen, her jaw nearly hitting the floor.Had she misheard? No-she hadn't. It was SO unbelievable.


Kevin had no interest in arguing. Time was slipping through their fingers. He turned back to Grace with quiet respect, silently urging her to lead the way.


"I'm going in now. Don't worry about Aunt Eliana.I won't let anything happen to her," Grace said confidently, casting a reassuring glance at her parents.


"Alright, go on. I believe in you!" Julia replied, her voice filled with pride and trust.


Rodger, though visibly surprised, was no fool.Watching the reverence doctor showed toward his daughter, he understood one thing clearly-Grace wasn't just capable. She was extraordinary.


With that, Grace and Kevin moved swiftly toward the
pre-op room, their footsteps echoing down the hall as the rest of the Holden family remained behind-silent,each lost in thought.


Gianna sat stiffly, her expression clouded wvith disbelief.She couldn't fathom how someone raised in an orphanage could possess such advanced medical skills.



The idea gnawed at her. Maybe Grace had seduced Kevin into backing her? It wouldn't be the first time a beautiful woman used charm to gain influence.Perhaps this was all part of her plan-to win the Holden family's trust and secure Eliana and Claire's gratitude.



It felt more believable the more she considered it.Kevin was young and single, so it made sense that Grace would enchant him.



After over fifteen hours of this extremely difficult and sophisticated procedure, the operating room light finally turned out.


Before long, Eliana was wheeled out.


"How is my mom?" Claire inquired, with a worried expression on her face.



Immediately, the rest gathered around.



"Don't worry, the surgery went really well," Grace
replied, taking off her mask.
###Chapter 64 To Shift The Story


After the gruelling hours in the operating room, Grace couldn't hide the tiredness in her face.


Claire, Carl, and the others followed closely as the nurses wheeled Eliana back to her hospital room.


Only Julia and Rodger stayed behind, their eyes clouded with worry as they watched over their daughter.



"You must be worn out,sweetheart," Julia said softly,steering Grace toward a small break room down the corridor."You were on your feet for hours... I brought some soup and pastries. Come sit. You need to eat something."



The break room was still and quiet-one of those rare moments where time slowed down just enough to breathe.



"Thank you, Mom," Grace murmured, her eyes landing on the food with a flicker of gratitude.



She'd performed countless surgeries before-some that stretched nearly two full days. She'd long grown used to powering through hunger, aches, and the
sharp sting of exhaustion.



But this time, she had family surrounding her with care and warmth.



She took a spoonful of soup. It didn't have the finesse of a five-star kitchen, but it tasted like home-and that meant more than perfection ever could.


"Silly girl, no need to thank me," Julia smiled,her voice brimming with affection. "You're my greatest joy. But even so... I don't want you to stay in this field.It's too draining."


There was no suspicion in her tone-no question about how a girl who'd grown up in an orphanage could master such complex surgical skill. She cared only about one thing: whether her was pushing herself too hard.



To her, Grace was just her beloved daughter-someone to be cherished, looked after, and spoiled.



Rodger agreed with a soft nod. "Your mom's right-you're our pride. But medicine takes a toll. If you ever get tired of this life, you don't have to keep going.I'll take care of everything."



Rodger wasn't blind. Deep down, he knew Grace wasn't just an ordinary girl. Her abilities, her insight-there wvas far more to her than she let on.
And yet, with each day spent in her company, his unease faded. She'd never once let them down-never given him a reason to doubt her intentions.


Especially now, with Julia recovering steadily and even his own health finding a strange sense of balance again-he couldn't deny that Grace had something to do with it. 2



So instead of suspicion, he gave her the one thing she'd rarely known: complete, unwavering trust.1


"Okay," Grace said,a real smile lifting her lips.


After eating a little, she accompanied them back to Eliana's room.



Eliana was awake now, but barely. The surgery had drained her body, and she lay quietly, her eyelids fluttering and lips barely able to move.


Claire,usually sharp-tongued and self-absorbed,now handled her mother with surprising tenderness. She dabbed Eliana's forehead with a damp cloth and tucked the blanket around her shoulders.


"The surgery went well," Kevin explained, standing just behind Grace. His posture was humble, like someone reporting to a senior rather than an equal."There were signs that the cancer had started to spread.The next stage-treatment and recovery-will
be just as important."



"Thankfully, Aunt Eliana had the best of care today,"Gianna added quickly, eager to pull attention away from Grace. "It's all thanks to Master Healer's hands-on effort. No wonder the surgery succeeded."


She tried to steer the spotlight elsewhere-to shift the story,bend the truth.



But Kevin didn't play along. His professional tone didn't waver. "No. I only assisted. Today's success was all due to my mentor. Without her leading,things might have gone differently."



He wasn't exaggerating. Even now, he couldn't stop replaying Grace's precise moves in the operating room.Her skill didn't come from money, fame,or lineage.It came from relentless practice and something harder to define-instinct.



The room fell quiet. Gianna, caught off guard, froze mid-thought. What was wrong with this man? She had handed him the credit-why wouldn't he just take it?


"Grace is amazing. I always knew she was special,"Julia said,glowing with motherly pride as she reached over to squeeze Grace's hand.


Gianna forced a smile. "Dr. Chadwick, you're being too modest." Then, pivoting with fake warmth, she added,"For the follow-up treatments, we'll still need your
expertise,of course."



But Kevin remained clear and blunt. "There's really no need. I didn't do much. I won't be handling her recovery either. She's in the best hands already. My mentor can take care of everything."



Gianna could barely keep her expression in check. Her polite mask threatened to crack. What was going on?Had he lost his mind? Was this Grace's doing? Some kind of manipulation? How could he speak like this-so confidently, so willingly stepping aside?



Meanwhile,Eliana,though pale and visibly worn down,was fully conscious-and her eyes settled on Grace,steady and unreadable, carrying a weight that was hard to name.
###Chapter 65 Aim For The Rejuvenation Pill



Eliana, who had once firmly opposed Rodger's decision to adopt Grace, now found herself quietly humbled. That very orphan she despised had just saved her life.



The emotion welled up so suddenly, it left her momentarily speechless. She didn't quite know how to describe it. Gratitude? Regret? Both?


Gianna,ever persistent, tried to downplay Grace's role.She kept insisting that it was Kevin who had pulled Eliana back from the brink of death. But Eliana wasn't naive. She could piece the truth together on her own.



Besides, if it hadn't been for Grace's sharp warning back then, she might never have realized how serious her illness truly was.


The thought made her lips press together in hesitation.After a moment's pause, she finally looked at Grace and murmured,"Thank you."


Just two simple words-but coming from Eliana,who was naturally proud and rarely admitted fault, they carried immense weight.
Gianna,upon hearing this, was stunned-and completely unwilling to accept it. Though her face remained composed, a storm of unease churned inside her.How swiftly had this wretched Grace managed to charm even Eliana? No, she wouldn't allow that.Absolutely not.



With a carefully measured tone, Gianna said, "Aunt Eliana, I've heard of a rare medicine called the Rejuvenation Pill. It's supposed to be very effective for your condition. There's an auction in a few days where it will be available, and Claire and I will do everything we can to get it for you."


Gianna intentionally included Claire in her statement,subtly expressing her willingness while ensuring that Claire would be the one footing the bill.


Claire, oblivious to her scheming, quickly declared,"Yes! I've heard those pills are amazing for recovering from serious illnesses." If they could save her mother,she'd stop at nothing to get them.


"Indeed, the Rejuvenation Pill is excellent for post-surgical recovery and can even help prevent the spread of tumor cells. Three pills eliminate the need for chemotherapy," Grace assured, a bit surprised that Gianna and Claire were aware of the drug.



"That's wonderful news," Eliana responded, her will to survive intensifying. At the thought of escaping the
torment of chemotherapy, her heart swelled with hope and gratitude toward Grace.


Everyone knew how brutal chemotherapy could be-the side effects alone were enough to break a person.The idea of bypassing that pain lit a fire of determination in Eliana's heart.



If the pill could truly spare her such suffering, then no price would be too high.


"Perfect! Mom, I swear I'll get the Rejuvenation Pill for you on the day of the auction!" Claire's eyes gleamed with resolve.


But that glimmer of hope didn't last long.


"The Rejuvenation Pill isn't easy to come by," Kevin interjected flatly. "It's a rare treasure and highly sought after. There will only be two pills available at the auction-and Mrs. Robertson needs at least three."He almost rolled his eyes at Claire's naïve enthusiasm.Did she really think this miracle drug was as easy to get as a loaf of bread?


"I... I didn't know that," Claire stammered, anxiety creeping into her voice.



"Don't worry for now," Rodger cut in, offering reassurance. "When the time comes, take Grace with you to the auction. Forget the cost-just make sure you get those two pills." He had no grasp of the
medical side of things, but if everyone said the medicine could help, then he would spare no expense.


When a family stood united, there was nothing they couldn't overcome.



Tears welled in Eliana's eyes as she lay on the sickbed.It was in moments like this-when life hung by a thread-that one truly saw who cared without condition.



Following Rodger's advice, Julia, who was gentle and devoted,continued to reassure Eliana, "Yeah. Let's try our best to obtain those two pills. When the time comes, we'll figure out a means to get another one.There will definitely be a way."



Meanwhile, Carl-who had remained silent thus far-was growing more and more disgruntled. Why should their family's wealth be poured into saving Eliana? She had married into another family. Shouldn't her husband be footing the bill? Yet here they were,watching as Eliana's husband offered neither money nor help, while Eliana drained the Holden family's resources. She had even tried to come back to her mother's house to seize things for Claire when she thought she was dying.How shameless could one get?



The more Carl thought about it, the more bitter he felt-especially with his wife always muttering that Rodger and Eliana were set to take over the Holden
family's properties, leaving him with nothing.


Resolving to take action, Carl decided to speak to Eliana's husband soon and demand he share in the financial burden for Eliana's care.








When the day of the auction arrived, Grace accompanied Gianna and Claire to the grandest and most exclusive auction house in town.



"This auction house belongs to the Pearson family,"Gianna said, holding up a gold-edged invitation as though it were a trophy. "Not just anyone can walk in -you need an official invitation." Her voice carried a deliberate air of pride.



Thanks to Claire, Gianna was invited for the first time and was there to expand her horizons.


However, she couldn't resist showing off in front of Grace as though she were a frequent visitor.


"You're correct. My mother made a lot of effort to receive two invitations. I can hardly bring you in, even though you don't have one," Claire said.
###Chapter 66 They Were Outbid



Claire felt a flicker of anxiety and a dip in confidence.


Eliana had pulled every string she could, leveraging her connections to secure two invitations-meant originally for Claie and Grace. After all, one was her daughter, and the other was the doctor who had saved her life.Grace was expected to play a critical role in her upcoming treatment and recovery.


But Gianna? What exactly was her contribution?Though she had brought up the Rejuvenation Pill, she hadn't done anything meaningful.


Eliana's original intention had been for Claire and Grace to attend together. However, a close friend of hers had offered a favor, mentioning that even without an official invitation, it was still possible to bring one extra person along.



The downside was that anyone entering without an invitation would be seen as riding someone else's coattails-hardly a flattering position.



Claire and Gianna shared a good relationship,and Claire couldn't bring herself to let Gianna be the one left out. Besides, Gianna had always carried herself
with pride, and her ego would never tolerate being the tag-along guest.


And so, Grace was the one who ended up without an invitation.


"You heard everything, right? Even if you don't have an invitation, there's still a seat for you, so don't stress,"Gianna said in mockery.


Seeing Grace's lack of reaction, she assumed she was flustered. A sense of petty satisfaction swelled in her chest. Finally, a chance to get even-for the way Grace had outshone her at the hospital.


But then, Grace merely offered a dispassionate,"If you're done talking, let's go." Then she strode calmly toward the auction entrance. These two were really overreacting.


All this drama-was it truly worth it over something as trivial as an invitation?



"Don't..."



Gianna began, ready to launch into another round of veiled jabs. But before she could finish, Grace brushed past her, retrieving a sleek black card encrusted with shimmering diamonds.


The staff member at the entrance immediately straightened. He received the card with both hands,
his posture turning deferential.


"You are our most esteemed Supreme VIP client.Please proceed to the second-floor private room."


Second-floor private room?! Gianna and Claire froze in place, utterly stunned. Although it was their first time here, they knew well enough what the second-floor private rooms meant-they were reserved for the auction house's top-tier clientele, requiring a quarterly spend of over ten million to qualify. In terms of wealth and status, those who were allowed access to the private rooms were in a different league.


The private rooms on the second floor were already extremely remarkable, with the exception of the greatest private room on the third floor.


Above that, the only private room on the third floor was legendary-exclusively held for the head of the Pearson family.



Grace came in, and the two of them hurried after her.They had assumed Grace was tagging along under their privilege. Now it was clear-they were the ones riding hers.



"This is so luxurious," Claire whispered in awe.


No wonder it was a room for a Supreme VIP.It wasn't particularly large, yet everything inside-every tile,every decorative piece-spoke of elegance and
wealth.


A massive floor-to-ceiling glass window stood at the front, crafted from a special one-way material. They could see everything in the auction hall, while no one below could see them.


Gianna and Claire, despite their polished upbringing in high society, now looked like wide-eyed villagers visiting the city for the first time, marveling at every detail.


Just being in that room made them feel like the most important people in the world. They began taking selfies for Instagram, each photo paired with a showy caption.



Soon,the auction officially began.


Gianna and Claire leaned forward, intrigued by the rare items presented-but neither dared place a bid. They needed to conserve every coin for the Rejuvenation Pill.



Grace, on the other hand, reclined in her seat,expression unreadable. Her thoughts were elsewhere.She was already considering whether she should lower the price of the Rejuvenation Pill herself.


After all, this was the Holden family's money, and Eliana's husband wasn't contributing a single dime.Grace had no desire to profit from her father's wealth.
"It's starting! The Rejuvenation Pill is up for auction!"


Gianna and Claire instantly perked up, visibly thrilled and ready for a heated bidding war.


Even though the starting price had been lowered to one hundred thousand per pill, it skyrocketed almost instantly-soaring to one million, then five million,and soon ten million-with no signs of slowing down.


The Holden family had allocated a budget of fifty million for this auction. But at this rate, even securing one pill seemed nearly impossible.


Grace hadn't expected the pills she crafted to attract such overwhelming demand.


Still, it wasn't surprising. These rare, life-saving pills were a godsend for the sick--and a magnet for the rich.


If spending tens of millions could offer even the slimmest chance of outrunning death, then to these wealthy elites, it was money well spent.


"Fifty million!" Claire shouted through gritted teeth,her voice trembling with determination. She had to get at least one pill.


But then came a cool, clear voice from the third floor -elegant and poised. "One hundred million dollars."
One hundred million for just one pill? It was madness.




Gianna and Claire sat frozen, their minds reeling. At last, they felt the sheer intensity of the competition at these elite auctions.




This time, they were hopelessly outbid-completely out of their league.
###Chapter 67 Was It Fate



The bidder in the third-floor private room clearly had no intention of playing fair-one offer, and they doubled the price without blinking.


Everyone else understood what that meant. That level belonged to the Pearsons.Going up against them wasn't brave-it was foolish. Anyone smart enough knew better than to keep bidding.


The moment that powerful offer came in,most participants fell silent and backed out. Challenging the Pearsons meant throwing their money away and inviting a public defeat.


At first, Claire was bold, puffed up by the idea that Rodger would cover the cost. She thought she might take on whoever was upstairs and win the two pills through sheer determination.



But as the numbers kept climbing, and the opposing bidder showed no sign of backing off, her courage vanished. She was no match for that kind of money.The figures were so outrageous they left her stunned.All her confidence drained away, and she quietly gave up.



Both Claire and Gianna were left humiliated. They had
promised Eliana they would win the pills, no matter what it took.



But tonight, they realized just how brutal the auction scene could be. These people weren't bidding with money-they were bidding with power.And Claire and Gianna had none to match it.


"What are we going to do now?" Claire whispered,voice cracking. "We didn't even get one pill... what's going to happen to my mom?" For all her usual pride and tantrums, nothing scared her more than the thought of losing her mother.


"Don't worry," Grace said calmly. Her tone was even,almost soothing. "Just two pills. We didn't win them tonight, but give me a little time. I promise, we'll get more."



Strangely enough, Grace was almost glad they lost.This way, her father wouldn't have to spend such a ridiculous amount of money on those pills.



As for the pills themselves-Grace knew she could make them. If she pushed herself a little harder,she could refine three or four more in about two weeks.



She quickly ran through the details in her mind. She still had enough rare herbs to get the job done. The only thing that took time was the refinement process -but she could handle that.
Moreover,Eliana had just come out of a major surgery and would need a full month to recover before starting chemotherapy. As long as Grace could finish making the pills within that time, there'd be no need to worry. For the sake of her parents, she was more than willing to put in the work.


"Wait, really?" Claire looked up,hope flashing in her eyes. "You can get the pills?"


But not everyone shared her belief. Gianna, standing beside them, looked like she'd just heard somnething laughable. She burst into laughter, the kind that wasn't friendly at all.


"Grace, come on. You think you're some kind of medical genius?" she scoffed, eyes full of mockery."That surgery only went well because Dr. Chadwick was there. He let you take the credit. Now you're acting like you saved Aunt Eliana all by yourself?" Her voice sharpened. "Even Dr. Chadwick couldn't get his hands on those pills. And you think you can? Don't be ridiculous."


With no guests around to impress, Gianna dropped all pretense. She sneered, her dislike clear as day.


"Claire, don't fall for her nonsense. Let's go." She tugged Claire's arm and pulled her away, not even sparing Grace another glance.
Claire didn't protest. She was still too anxious, too overwhelmed to think clearly. If she'd paused for even a second, she might have questioned how Grace had ended up in one of the VIP roomes in the first place.She might have wondered what kind of person Grace really was.



Grace didn't mind. Watching them leave only gave her peace. Finally, she had a moment of silence.



She leaned back and sent a quick message to Patrick,updating him about the Rejuvenation Pill.


Meanwhile, up in the third-floor VIP room, a tall,striking man sat with relaxed confidence,his custom-made suit outlining broad shoulders and a refined build.The watch on his wrist gleamed under the soft light,and his tie sat perfectly in place-everything about him was sharp,elegant,and powerful.



It was Colton.



At that moment, Dominick approached, holding out a small, intricately designed room with both hands.Inside it was the pills they had just spent a fortune on.



Colton took the room without a word, his face unreadable. "Who was in the second-floor VIP room?"he asked. "The one who tried to outbid me."



Whoever it was had guts-foolish guts, but still guts.
Dominick didn't hesitate. "That would be people from the Holden family."


"The Holdens?" Colton raised an eyebrow. The name rang a bell. Ah, yes-the family that had adopted Grace.



Dominick paused before continuing. "And if I'm correct... the person bidding was Miss Miller herself."


As Colton's closest aide, Dominick understood his boss perfectly well.


The moment Colton paid his attention to the second floor,he quietly went to check. And what he found nearly made his heart skip a beat.


He knew one thing for certain-when it came to Grace Miller, his boss was anything but indifferent.


"Grace Miller?" Colton finally reacted, a flicker of something crossing his face. "Her... again?"



The last time they fought for an item in the underground market. And now here they were once more-this time, both after a life-saving medicine.



Was it fate?



Without saying another word, Colton stood,brushed down his suit, and stepped out of the room.
Downstairs,Grace had just leaned back into the plush seat, quietly sipping a drink and texting. The calm was a welcome break. Then a knock came.




Before she could even respond, the door opened.And there he was. Colton.
###Chapter 68 Colton's Other Identity



Grace wasn't surprised when Colton showed up.


After all,the Pearson family owned this auction house,and the third floor was their personal viewing area.



It only made sense that someone capable of offering such a staggering sum for the Rejuvenation Pill would be Colton. And for Colton, who had recently undergone detox, the pills would be especially useful,acting as a restorative aid in his healing process.


But what puzzled Grace was why he had come looking for her out of the blue. She asked directly, voicing her thoughts, "Do you need something from me?"


"I did1. I didn't realize it was you bidding for the pills earlier. If I had known, I wouldn't have tried to outbid you," Colton replied honestly.


He signaled to Dominick, who was standing behind him,to bring the expensive pills forward. "If you are in urgent need of them, they are yours."


Dominick swiftly handed her the finely crafted box.


He couldn't help but feel a sense of shock at how
willingly Colton gave up the pills. Was it possible that he had developed feelings for Grace?



"These are for me?" Grace arched a brow. "You paid a hefty price for them. You should keep them. They are beneficial for your recovery."


"It's fine. You healed me, and I'll manage even without the two pills," Colton replied, acknowledging her past help, especially when she had saved his life.If she was this eager to obtain the pills, ithad to be urgently required.


It probably wasn't easy to produce these pills.Otherwise, with her level of skill, she would have brewed up a fresh batch by now.



Grace wasn't one to stand on ceremony.Since he was insistent, she accepted the box without hesitation.


Eliana needed the pills urgently, and Grace planned to make more soon and repay Colton double. She didn't want to owe him a debt.



"Thanks. I'll be going now," Grace said, offering a brief nod of appreciation before taking the box and leaving.


After Grace left, the warmth in Colton's expression vanished, replaced by his usual cold demeanor. This brought a sense of relief to Dominick. The way Colton had looked at Grace had been unlike anything
Dominick had ever seen from him.



He wanted to ask Colton why he had given away such valuable pills, but he didn't dare speak up.


Later, Ryan showed up. After hearing what had happened, he wasted no time voicing the question Dominick dared not ask. "Seriously? You just handed those priceless pills over to Grace Miller? What's going on? Are you falling for her?"


To most who knew Colton, he came across as calculating,ruthless, and emotionally detached.Yet he also showed unwavering loyalty and generosity toward his close friends and subordinates.


Still, his generosity was never without purpose. It usually came with expectations.


Therefore,why was he so kind to Grace?



Colton wasn't just any mnan. With eyes constantly watching him and a secret identity to protect,he couldn't afford emotional entanglements with just any woman. Unless she had something of real value to offer him.



At Ryan's comment, Colton's calm, unreadable eyes narrowed slightly. Just as he was about to respond, his phone buzzed in his hand. He instinctively picked it up,and his pupils suddenly constricted.
Without a word to Ryan, he turned and headed straight back to his private room on the third floor,where everything he might need was within easy reach.



Once inside, he immediately began navigating his phone, clearly handling something urgent.



Having known him for so long, both Ryan and Dominick recognized the shift in mood and took up positions at the door to block any interruptions or prying ears.



Colton's phone wasn't an ordinary device. It was a custom-built model with several advanced systems.


As he swiped, the interface shifted to a different system, revealing a specialized program filled with lines of code.



While the codes might have seemed like gibberish to others, Colton understood them instantly.


He then navigated to his email and opened a top-secret message safeguarded by multiple layers of encryption.



After reading its contents, he erased it without hesitation.



Noticing that Colton appeared to be done, Ryan walked over, his usual carefree attitude replaced with
a rare seriousness.



"What's going on? Did they hand down new orders?"he asked, a thread of worry creeping into his voice.



Though Colton now held immense power and influence, it hadn't always been that way. He had gone through relentless hardship and shown unwavering grit to rise to where he stood today.



While he feared no one now, the one who had shaped and trained him into the formidable force he'd become still had a hold on him. If an order came down,he had no choice but to carry it out.


This was what had forged his cold, unfeeling persona,making him appear detached, emotionless, and incapable of placing real trust or affection in anyone.



"They have assigned me to eliminate someone,"Colton said calmly.


"Who is it?" Ryan asked, expecting it to be another drug lord or gambling kingpin.


"A secretly cultivated national genius," Colton answered.	1
###Chapter 69 Two Factions



"What? What are you talking about?" Ryan blinked,clearly confused, unable to grasp Colton's words.


"It's the top genius secretly trained by the southern faction," Colton explained, his tone unusually patient.


Despite his immense wealth and privately trained forces, the upper ranks of the nation were beyond his reach. No matter how powerful he became, he still couldn't override the authority of the state.


Even the highest powers had to answer to justice-at least in theory. But beneath that official surface, the reality was far more complex.


As far as Colton was concerned, the national leadership was secretly split into two rival factions-northern and southern-both claiming to serve the country,yet constantly engaged in a covert power struggle.


Colton belonged to the northern faction. He had been nurtured by its leader, a connection that had elevated both his influence and theirs.


As Colton rose in strength, the northern faction's hold on power deepened.
Two years ago, Colton had completed a high-stakes mission to dismantle a massive drug cartel. He captured the kingpin alive, securing a critical victory for the northern faction-one that decisively outshone the southern faction.



But the success came at a steep cost. During the operation, Colton had been poisoned with a rare and lethal toxin that nearly claimed his life.



The incident almost shattered the northern faction's dominance. Yet, against the odds, they held their ground and continued to lead.


In the aftermath, rumors began to circulate. Word reached Colton that the southern faction had quietly cultivated a top-tier genius-someone unmatched in hacking, combat, business strategy, and other elite skills. Her intellect was said to be extraordinary, her versatility beyond belief.


However,everything about her was sealed in secrecy.This so-called genius-engineered and nurtured by the nation itself-was a ghost. Not even Colton could uncover any concrete details.


Only one fact had been confirmed: she was female.Her name, her age, her face-none of it was known.


All that searching,all those dead ends-Colton figured it was time he handled things personally.
"So,the southern faction finally has something worth showing off," Ryan said, brow tightening in thought."That genius of theirs might even be able to match you. No wonder they've had such a string of victories lately."



"Her age and identity remain a mystery," Colton said coolly. "Uncovering her will take time."


It explained everything-the southern faction's rapid advancements in the past two years. Their foreign intelligence network, military breakthroughs, and talent development likely all stemmed from her efforts.



That woman's efforts were probably the cause.



"I think she's an elderly woman. From there, we could begin the hunt," Ryan conjectured once more.



Geniuses like Colton-those who rose to legendary status at a young age-were exceedingly rare. If that female genius was truly a woman of such remarkable capabilities, then she likely wasn't young either.


After all, how else could she have cultivated such a formidable skill set?


"Not necessarily," Colton replied, his voice cold and razor-sharp. "I will find her."
"Then it's clear-you've gained a formidable enemy,"Ryan said, his tone sobering. "Unless you completely sever ties with the northern faction, you'll have no choice but to defeat that woman."



If she remained unchecked, the hardline elders of the southern faction would never give up their pursuit.


Though both factions claimed loyalty to the nation,their clashing philosophies and cutthroat competition often turned them into enemies.



"I'll make sure she's out of the picture," Colton said flatly. "And I'll walk away from the northern faction."His eyes, deep and impenetrable, revealed nothing.


To Colton, neither the female genius nor the political factions held any real significance. They didn't stir his emotions. They didn't even register.


He absently tapped his fingers on the tabletop-a quiet, rhythmic sound that only intensified the oppressive stillness hanging in the room.


The only reason he hadn't cut ties yet was simple-leaving now would ruin the fun.



Colton thrived in the shadows. Why not go all in this time? Let them tear each other apart while he watched from the sidelines. Now that would be entertaining.
The atmosphere in the room had grown oppressively heavy. Dominick didn't dare make a sound-he didn't even breathe too loudly, quietly standing by, waiting for instructions.


Sensing the shift in mood, and realizing the topic had been thoroughly dissected, Ryan pivoted-slipping back into his usual lighthearted tone.


"By the way,Colton, I really think it's great that you've taken a liking to Miss Miller. She's quite the woman,"Ryan said with a grin. "Not only did she save your life,but she's incredibly skilled. She's got talent in stone gambling, probably aces every academic test, and always stays calm and sharp. Honestly, she's a perfect match for you."


At last, it all made sense to Ryan-why Colton gave Grace such special treatment. He clearly wanted to win her over and use her as a weapon against that mysterious genius.


It was a brilliant strategy.Typical Colton-calculating,methodical,always three steps ahead.


"Oh?" Colton arched a brow, expression unreadable."Did I ever say l intended to pursue her?"


"Didn't you?" Ryan pressed, still grinning. "Why else would you treat her so well? Isn't it all part of the plan?Use her to eliminate that mysterious genius and bring
down the northern faction in the process?"



After all, Grace was gorgeous, so it was the ideal plan,and there would be no loss!
###Chapter 70 Undermining Grace Again


Ryan wilted under Colton's steady gaze, nerves fraying until he nearly let out a squeak. Only when Colton shifted his eyes away did the tension finally break.


A sneerescaped Colton as he walked off, leaving any words unsaid.



When the door closed behind him, Ryan let out a shaky breath, pressing a hand to his chest before he shot a questioning look at Dominick,who'd watched everything in silence. "Can you explain that? What's with that sneer? Did I mess up? I thought he liked Grace!"



Dominick hesitated, edging away fom Ryan's reach."I... I couldn't say. No one's ever been able to guess what he's thinking," he replied, then darted out after Colton before more questions could come.


Colton's thoughts remained a mystery. He wore his detachment like armor, and his interest in Grace might have run deeper than simple gratitude-though what else lay beneath, Dominick wasn't brave enough to imagine.


Whatever the truth, he would never dare ask.
Returning home from the auction, Gianna and Claire carried with them only disappointment, dreading the moment they'd have to face their family members,but they couldn't avoid it.


Claire's voice trembled with regret as she spoke. "I'm sorry, Mom. We weren't able to win the Rejuvenation Pill-the bidding was overwhelming, and there was no way to compete."


The gap in resources left her helpless, unable to change what had happened.


A gentle sigh escaped Eliana. "Given that we were up against the Pearsons, it's hardly surprising we lost out,"she said, her disappointment tempered with understanding rather than blame for her daughter.


The thought had lingered in her mind that there might not be a cure for her at all. Having come this far and still being alive already felt like more than she could have asked for. The rest was in fate's hands.


At least she had been given a little more time. Once she regained some strength, she fully intended to confront her husband and reclaim what rightfully belonged to her.


Whatever she managed to win back, she would leave
for her daughter's future, hoping that, even in her absence,Claire would never have to struggle.


Julia's voice rang with reassurance as she stepped forward, having accompanied Rodger for this visit."Try not to lose heart, Eliana. Those pills aren't your only hope. With Grace by your side, you'll get the care you need, and I believe you'll recover."


Rodger echoed his wife's encouragement, adding his own quiet conviction. "Julia's absolutely right. Stay optimistic-your mental outlook is just as important as any medicine."


Their combined support eased some of the weight pressing on Eliana's chest, and her mood gradually lifted.



Yet, trouble always seemed to find its way in.Someone piped up with a tone dripping with false concern. "You know, I really think we might've gotten those pills if Grace hadn't objected. She said it cost too much and didn't think it was worth the risk. She was worried about us being able to pay, so..."


Gianna was the one stirring the pot. Still harboring resentment towards Grace, she jumped at the chance to speak poorly of Grace behind her back, hoping to sway the family's opinion.


Claire knew full well that Gianna's claim was a
fabrication-Grace hadn't said anything of the sort.


But,catching Gianna's pleading look and remembering all the years they'd been friends, Claire kept quiet,even if it left her uneasy.



Julia was quick to jump in, her voice sharp and unwavering. "That's out of the question! Grace would never act that way!"


Even though her time with Grace had been short,her faith in the girl never wavered.



There was also the practical side to consider. Why should Grace worry about the price? The Holden family would have covered the expense, not Grace herself, so what possible motive could she have for objecting?


People weren't so easily misled.


Any trace of warmth in Julia's expression toward Gianna vanished, replaced by a clear, cold distance.


Caught off guard by Julia's stern look, Gianna felt a stab of guilt, her eyes darting away before she quickly resumed her act, still clinging to her supposed sincerity.


Rodger's words followed, calm but resolute. "Let's not place blame on Grace. She's always been thoughtful and dependable. If her intentions weren't good, she
never would've gone to such lengths for Eliana's surgery."


While Rodger didn't display his affection as openly as Julia,his faith in Grace ran deep.


Every moment spent with Grace had only made his respect grow-she was levelheaded and talented,no matter what others whispered.


Surrounded by such unwavering loyalty and wvarmth toward Grace, Gianna's frustration festered, the truth settling in that her influence had faded.


Her calculated attempts to undermine Grace fell flat,her motives now plain to everyone,leaving her feeling exposed and out of place.


If only she'd thought to bring Ethel along. With Ethel's support, she might have found an ally and avoided this humiliating defeat.


At that moment, Grace stepped into the room,her arrival only deepening Gianna's sense of unease.


The second Grace entered, everyone gravitated toward her, with Julia's worry shining the brightest.


Julia hurried over, fussing with gentle affection."Grace, I thought you would go home and catch up on your sleep. You must be tired."
Brushing off the concern with a quiet composure,Grace replied, "Fatigue isn't an issue. I came to deliver the Rejuvenation Pill for Aunt Eliana." Her calm announcement sent a quiet shockwave through the room, the news landing like a pebble dropped into still water.###Chapter 71 A Change In View




A mocking smile flickered across Gianna's face."Rejuvenation Pill? Grace, did you hit your head and forget we lost that auction? Or are you living in some fantasy where you managed to get one?"


Nobody in the room wanted to dredge up their failed attempt at the auction. The subject had already been quietly buried.


Yet Grace walked in, bold as ever, casually claiming she'd secured the legendary pills. It almost sounded like a bad joke.



Gianna jumped at the chance, eager to put Grace in her place.


"Just because you're empty-handed doesn't mean everyone else has to be," Grace responded coolly,slicing through Gianna's smugness without raising her voice.
"Are you actually saying you got them?"


Grace ignored her completely and went straight to Eliana's bedside. From her bag, she produced a box and opened it, revealing two delicate pills.


"Aunt Eliana, these are for you. I only managed to bring two, but I'll get more soon. You only need to take one a week, so three or four should do the trick."



She was confident that two weeks was plenty of time to create more.



"This is wonderful!" Eliana's pale face brightened instantly, her eyes reflecting newfound hope.


Suspicion twisted Gianna's features. "You expect us to believe those are real? Aunt Eliana, you know how impossible it is to get your hands on even one, let alone two. You really think Grace could just pull this off?"



Sarcasm dripped from every word as she turned to Grace. "Or did you pick those up from some back alley witch doctor? Are you sure they're not just poison?"


Claire's nerves began to fray, uncertainty flickering across her face. How could Grace get her hands on medicine worth hundreds of millions so easily?


"Mom, maybe we should hold off... what if they're counterfeit and end up making you worse?" Claire's concern was genuine, fueled more by fear than mistrust of Grace.



Julia moved as if to defend Grace, but a gentle gesture from her daughter kept her quiet. Grace offered a look that was steady and full of calm reassurance.



Returning Gianna's gaze, Grace's voice rang out-cool, unyielding."Funny how the louIdest skeptics are always the ones who've never achieved anything themselves."


"If it's real, tell us exactly how you got them."Gianna's patience had thinned to the breaking point,but she stood her ground, refusing to let Grace's smugness chase her off.


Grace arched her eyebrow, keeping her face like a closed book. "Even if I told you Mr. Pearson handed them over himself, you wouldn't buy it."


"Mr. Pearson? That's outrageous. Why would a man like him trust something so valuable to you-someone who grew up in an orphanage?"


Gianna almost burst out laughing, the whole idea struck her as downright absurd.


"Let's put a stop to this." Julia's eyes grew stormy,and she shot Gianna a look. "Gianna, do you realize how harsh you sound toward Grace right now?"


For all her sweetness and innocence, even Julia could not pretend she hadn't noticed Gianna's sudden change.


Caught off guard, Gianna faltered. The sharpness in her voice had escaped her until now, and she wished she'd been more careful.


Grace answered, her tone level and her words deliberate, "Mom, I'm telling the truth. Colton Pearson gave them to me himself. I did him a favor once, and this is how he chose to thank me."


She didn't bother with lengthy explanations. She faced Eliana and said, "If you have faith in me, take these pills. I promise they'll do what you need."


No hesitation flickered across Eliana's face. "I trust you completely."



After everything Grace had done-pulling her back from the jaws of death-Eliana found it impossible to question her. From this point forward, she knew her recovery would rest entirely in Grace's hands. That kind of faith came easily now.


Rodger sealed the matter with a decisive nod. "If Grace stands behind the medicine, so do l. And since Eliana has no doubts, that should be enough for the rest of us."



He had heard enough. Quietly, he made up his mind about Gianna as well.
Now that Rodger had spoken, both Gianna and Claire kept silent, not daring to argue further.


Meanwhile, Julia lifted her chin, pride written across her face. The light in her eyes was so warm;Grace nearly laughed at the sight-her mother could be endearingly cheerful at the oddest moments.


Bit by bit, family members trickled out the door.


Grace lingered, her attention fixed on laying out every detail of Eliana's medical care and the path forward. If Eliana stuck to her advice, she could look forward to decades more-twenty or thirty years would be well within reach.


For someone already past fifty, hearing she might see her seventies or even eighties brought a sense of relief she had not felt in years.


Silence soon filled the space, with only Eliana and Grace left behind. After wavering for a while, Eliana finally found her voice.


"Grace, I truly owe you everything. If not for you, I doubt I'd still be alive. Thank you for saving me."


Nothing less than a heartfelt thank you would do.She could not pretend Grace hadn't changed her fate.


Memories flooded back-she remembered when this quiet young woman first stepped into the family home. Eliana herself had met her with suspicion,even hostility.


Life had a way of turning the tables. In the end,Grace was the reason she still had another chance to live.


After all, with her remarkable medical talent, Grace could have chosen any path. Why would she covet the Holdens' wealth? People far richer than her own family would have lined up for her help, ready to pay any price.


Watching this composed and quietly remarkable young woman, Eliana realized she had come to see her in a whole new light.
###Chapter 72 The Devil
No need for the gratitude. I didn't do this for you-it was for my parents." Grace didn't sugarcoat anything. With people she didn't care much for, she saw no reason to be polite or spare their feelings.


She was just being honest. If Eliana hadn't been her father's sister, she wouldn't have wasted her time trying to save her.


Time was precious to her, and she didn't give it away freely-not unless it was for the people she loved.


Eliana understood the message behind Grace's bluntness. She didn't argue with it either. But her opinion of Grace had started to shift.


People naturally admired those with true skill. And Grace, despite her age, had just pulled someone back from the brink of death with calm precision.That kind of ability drew respect, even from those who didn't like her.
So,although Grace didn't act warm, Eliana wasn't offended. In the end, Grace had saved her life.


They didn't talk much beyond what was necessary.They weren't close enough to chat about personal things, and both knew it.


Grace kept it professional. She explained the next steps in Eliana's recovery plan clearly and thoroughly.


Her approach wasn't like that of most doctors. And with the help of the Rejuvenation Pill, the entire recovery process would be smoother. The pain would be easier to manage, and the illness wouldn't last as long.



If things went according to plan, Eliana could return to a normal life in under three months-as long as she stayed away from heavy drinking.


When Grace finished explaining, she didn't stick around for pleasantries. She turned and left.


They weren't close, and staying would only make things feel stiff. Besides, she had more pressing matters waiting. She didn't have time for small talk.


Not long after Grace left, Claire came in,followed by a servant carrying a tray of food.


"Claire, I need to talk to you. And I need you to listen carefully."


"Why are you being so intense?" Claire asked nervously. For a moment, she feared her mom's condition had suddenly worsened.


"It's about Grace. She's not someone you want as an enemy. And be careful around Gianna. Instead,spend more time with Grace. And I mean it-genuinely befriend her."


Grace wasn't ordinary. She was sharp, capable, and never one to tolerate games. If treated with sincerity,she'd return it tenfold. But if anyone tried to trick her or treat her with false kindness, she'd walk away without a second thought.


"Wait-what? I thought you said Gianna was mazing, and that we should stay close so we can look out for each other?"



Now that she realized this wasn't a health scare,Claire's tension melted, and everything else felt less important.


"That was before. Things have changed. Just. do what I say, Claire. I wouldn't lead you wrong."


Eliana had once hoped that Gianna and Claire would form a strong bond-they were cousins, and Gianna seemed dependable, polite, even admirable. It had felt safe to put her trust there.


But now, looking more closely, Eliana had begun to see through the surface. Gianna was cunning. Claire,on the other hand, was too trusting, too straightforward. She might be used or misled without even knowing.


But Grace was different. Eliana had watched her closely. She felt sure that Grace was discreet and would never play dirty tricks.
Claire might not realize it now, but building a true friendship with Grace could change her life for the better.



What Eliana didn't know yet was just how right she was-and how much she would one day thank herself for this decision.







After leaving the hospital, Grace didn't go home. She had arranged to meet Patrick instead.


"Is there a new assignment?"


They met at one of their company's private wineries.It was secure and quiet, with only their people around.



Patrick asked the moment she arrived.



If something new was brewing, especially something involving higher powers, it had to be handled carefully.


"Not quite," Grace replied. "No new task-just a warning. Word is, the Devil from the northern faction has his sights on me. He doesn't know who I am yet,but he's searching."


Grace had been aware of the tension between the northern and southern factions for a long time.


She was state-trained, handpicked for elite operations. Her real allegiance wasn't to the Holdens -it was to the country.


That idea might sound cold, like she was property,not a person. But she didn't flinch from it. She'd made peace with it and was committed to the missions given to her. She was their best asset.


As for the so-called "Devil", that was a nickname she and Patrick had come up with in private.


They didn't know exactly who the person was. What they did know was that he was the northern faction's secret weapon, just like Grace was for the southern side.



So, just as she couldn't figure out who the other person was, they couldn't easily find out who she was either.


That fragile balance was exactly why the two factions remained divided. Neither one was willing to step back or give the other the upper hand.


"What if they find out who you are?" Patrick asked."They'd probably try to kill you." He was concerned.


"They can try," Grace said with a small shrug. "But the state wouldn't let that happen. They'll protect me." She gave him a confident look. "I've got my own people too."


Even though Grace was cherished by her faction's leaders and had no intention of ever betraying them,she still built her own safety net, her own circle of people she could count on.


That way, no matter what happened, she wouldn't be left defenseless.
###Chapter 73 Dashing Their Dreams
Grace tossed around several possibilities in her mind about the Devil. Could the person be a bald man in his middle years?



People had looked into it from every angle, but the individual's true identity remained locked behind layers of national-level encryption.


Since the person wasn't the result of a government training program, she guessed youth was off the table. There was no sign of a natural prodigy,either.


Patrick gave her a nod. "I'll digaround and see if something turns up."


Despite his reputation for joking around, he took his assignments seriously when it counted most.



These days, he had pledged his loyalty to Grace without reservation.
With a dangerous enemy fixated on her, he couldn't ignore the fact that her days would not be calm.


Their enemy might not know her true background,but eventually, her social ties, connections, and daily patterns would be exposed.


Determined to unmask and destroy her, this foe would stop at nothing. Her team needed to stay alert and ready to outmaneuver them.


"You're in charge of this, Patrick," Grace told him.She didn't expect much would come of it, but it was better to be safe than sorry.


Attacks aimed at those close to her or the places she managed were a real possibility, so she had to be ready for that.






With Eliana's crisis managed, Grace slipped back into the routine of an ordinary student, quietly blending into the background at school.


For someone with her credentials, sitting through lectures felt like a bad joke. She already held a postdoctoral degree, and several gifted scholars-Kevin and Terry among them-counted her as their mentor.



Still, campus life provided the perfect cover, a way to stay invisible while plotting her next moves.


She kept at it partly because her parents hoped she would enjoy a happy student life. Letting them down was the last thing she wanted.


Gianna,meanwhile, grew more uneasy every day.


Since leaving the hospital, she noticed a subtle but unmistakable shift in how Rodger, Julia, and even Claire treated her.


She couldn't put her finger on it, but she was no longer the favorite girl she used to be. The trouble started when Grace entered the Holden family.She had been a thorn in Gianna's side from the beginning.Gianna refused to let things stay that way -she was ready to push back.

With Terry on the lookout for standout students,Gianna saw a golden opportunity. If she could impress him, a recommendation to the elite Summit University might be within her reach.


Support from all the faculty put Gianna in a strong position. If she managed to win over Terry,recognition and respect would finally be hers. That triumph would put Grace firmly in her shadow,proving that raw talent outshines connections and relentless hard work any day. A wave of calm washed over Gianna at the thought. She threw herseIf into thesis preparation, determined to dazzle Terry when the moment came.



Excitement buzzed through the campus on the day Terry made his appearance. Both students and teachers were keen to leave a good impression.


Ellie offered Gianna a gentle push of encouragement."Gianna, the dean both picked you to greet Prof.Warren. This is your shot-make the most of it and let your strengths shine. Your thesis was crafted specifically for his research interests and ideas. I
know he'll be impressed."


Ellie had spared no effort, delving into Terry's published work and academic pursuits to give Gianna the best possible advantage.


Success today wouldn't just boost Gianna's reputation-it would elevate Ellie's standing as well,earning her respect and perhaps even a heartfelt thank-you from the Holden family. Everyone stood to gain.


With a spark in her eyes, Gianna answered, "Don't worry, Ms. Dixon. My thesis is rock solid, and I'm sure Prof. Warren will be pleased." Having kept up with the latest direction of his research, she was convinced this win was already hers. Once the recommendation letter was secured, she'd be sure to repay Ellie for years of guidance.


Both teacher and student were riding high on hope when the department head swept in and dashed their dreams. "Why are you two loitering here? Prof.Warren's already arrived-and Mr. Baldwin took Grace Miller to greet him."
"What?!" Both Gianna and Ellie cried out together."Grace is meeting Prof. Warren too? How did that happen?"


The department head gave them a withering look,worlds apart from the dean's usual patience. "Grace Miller is our top student this year. Who else would we choose?"


Academic performance spoke louder than anything else at this school. Grace had achieved a flawless score, earning first place statewide-naturally, she would represent the institution.


"No, that's impossible! She must have cheated!"Gianna blurted out, unable to hide her frustration.


"Is that so? Go ahead and try cheating your way to a perfect score. I'd love to see you pull that off," the department head said, sarcasm in his voice as he raised an eyebrow. Rolling his eyes again, he left them standing there with their excuses sounding more foolish by the second.
###Chapter 74 A Talent-scouting Mission

As far as the department head was concerned,achieving a perfect score without drawing attention would require real cleverness and strategy.


He snapped, "Move it already! If you keep standing around, I'll pick someone else!" With an exaggerated eye roll, he turned away, clearly done with Ellie and Gianna, and stalked off, leaving them behind.


Simmering with resentment, Gianna forced herself to stay quiet. As soon as she secured her guaranteed admission, that department head would be the first to get a taste of her triumph. Honestly, what made him think he was special? All he had was a family connection to the principal-hardly worth bragging about.


Ellie, standing at Gianna's side, felt her own frustration building. With a track record of top students and consistent spots on the honor roll,both she and Gianna deserved more respect. Yet in front of the department head, their achievements seemed invisible. It was too irritating.


No matter how irritated they were, neither wanted to risk losing the spotlight to Grace and Anthony.Together, they hurried off toward the reception.


Terry's arrival sent ripples of excitement through the entire campus. Organizers had pulled out all the stops, arranging ceremonial greeters and picking standout students from every class.


Stepping into the crowd, Gianna quickly realized she wasn't the only one who'd been chosen to greet Terry. Each class had someone there.


While a twinge of envy lingered, at least Grace wouldn't have the stage all to herself.


Spotting Grace off to one side, overshadowed by the other representatives, Gianna's confidence returned.


By now, Terry had stepped onto the scene. Clad in a simple white casual outfit, he drew the attention of students and school leaders as he moved toward the sprawling lecture hall.


Four sharply dressed bodyguards walked beside him,keeping close, while an assistant managed the details of his visit.



Terry's reputation preceded him. Many whispered that he'd soon join the ranks of the nation's top academics. His groundbreaking work in both environmental science and artificial intelligence had left a lasting mark.1



A figure of national importance, he had arrived at the school on a talent-scouting mission. Naturally,everyone vied for a sliver of his attention. The possibility that Terry might single them out was too enticing to ignore.


With Ellie expertly navigating the crowd, Gianna seized her chance to approach Terry, eager to flaunt her credentials and even slipping seamlessly into fluent French as she introduced herself and described her recent publication.

 For a moment, Terry looked impressed with her enthusiasm. But then, his expression changed. A puzzled frown crossed his face. "Tell me, why are you speaking a foreign language? There's not a foreigner in sight."


Terry's tone held both confusion and subtle disapproval.


That open question in front of everyone made Gianna shrink inside, cheeks burning with embarrassment.She'd simply hoped to demonstraté her proficiency in a foreign language. Yet, his question twisted her attempt into something less dignified.


A few nearby students tried-and failed-to stifle their laughter, only adding to her humiliation.


From the sidelines, Grace, ever the observer,couldn't resist muttering under her breath, "What an idiot."


"Prof. Warren, Gianna recently went to France for vacation, and she got so caught up in the environment that she accidentally blurted out some French when she got carried away," said Ellie,jumping in to shield her student.


"I see," Terry replied blandly, not pursuing the matter further.


Without wasting another second, he made his way toward the lecture hall. The crowd behind him scrambled to keep up, not wanting to be left behind.


People had followed without question. That was the power of someone truly capable-no need for extra words.


When Terry entered, he found the hall already brimming with faculty and students. His arrival was met with a round of eager applause.


With Gianna trying to look important by striding close beside him, she almost played the part of his aide.


Terry launched into his lecture, diving straight into the fast-evolving world of artificial intelligence.


Al had become the talk of the town, and with his expertise, Terry broke down its latest trends and future possibilities for everyone present.


The coming decade, he explained, would belong to those who could master artificial intelligence. Great fortunes and influence awaited those with the skill to lead in the field.


Plenty of students dreamed of chasing success in Al,though few would truly master it.


"I've read several remarkable papers from you guys.It makes me proud to see such sharp minds taking shape." Terry's gaze swept the room, and he looked genuinely pleased. At last, the nation's young talents were beginning to blossom.


Praise from someone of Terry's stature was a moment of happiness for students and teachers alike.



"Special mention goes to Gianna White, Johnny Holden, and Beatrice Green. Your grasp of artificial intelligence is truly exceptional."
###Chapter 75 Could She Really Be This Remarkable
Terry's words instantly delighted the three students he had mentioned, and even their teachers couldn't help but share in the moment of recognition.


Ellie had expected Gianna to catch Terry's attention,but Johnny being praised had taken her by surprise.


Though Johnny was in her class, he had always been more relaxed about academics. His grades lacked the consistency of Gianna's, and he certainly wasn't as obedient or eager to please.


Because of this,Ellie had never intended to invest in him. Now that a student she had overlooked was suddenly singled out by Terry, her surprise was inevitable.



Still, despite her initial shock, a deeper sense of pride and satisfaction began to grow.
Two of her students had received praise from Terry.That could only improve her chances of earning a promotion this year.


"Johnny, you're amazing! Congratulations on being praised by Prof. Warren!" Beatrice said cheerfully,her bright smile lighting up her face.


Though she wasn't in Johnny's class, her seat happened to be beside him.


"Um, it's nothing, probably just luck," Johnny replied,caught off guard by the attention. The compliment from the girl he liked made him scratch his head shyly, a quiet joy blooming in his chest.


He usually spent his free time tinkering with computers and had even taught himself a bit of hacking. That hobby had sparked his interest in artificial intelligence.


Besides, the legendary leader of the International Hacker Alliance was his idol. Joining that elite group was more than a fantasy. It was a dream he quietly clung to. Driven by that dream, he had immersed  himself in early studies and secret research, hoping that one day, he might actually be worthy of joining that prestigious organization.
"Johnny, you're so talented, yet you stay humble and quiet. I really admire that," Beatrice added,gazing at him with genuine admiration. She had a knack for choosing words that would make him feel special-and more devoted to her.


"I'm flattered." Johnny's ears turned slightly red from her praise. A warm flush spread through him as he lowered his head, shy but happy.


Meanwhile, Gianna sat near Terry in the front row,proudly holding her place as one of the student representatives. Hearing her name spoken by Terry filled her with pride. Still, she felt a twinge of resentment at having to share the spotlight. There was only one place at the top. And it should belong to her! Everyone else-Johnny, Beatrice-was nothing when compared to her.



She cast a deliberate glance toward Grace,who sat a short distance away, seemingly unfazed by the  recognition. She smirked and, feigning casual concern, said smugly, "Grace, what a pity. Professor Warren didn't mention your name. You'd better keep working hard, and don't let your parents down.Wouldn't want to disappoint them again."


"They'll probably be disappointed forever. Some people just aren't meant to succeed, no matter how hard they try." Ellie, ever quick to gossip and proud of her judgment, chimed in with a biting remark when she overheard Gianna's jab.



Unfortunately for them, their words failed to provoke Grace. As if she hadn't heard a thing, she remained calm, not sparing them even a glance. Not a flicker of emotion crossed her face.



Ellie had never met a student who dared ignore her so completely. When she was being sarcastic or outright scolding her students, they typically responded with either reverence or fear."


"Why the silence? Do you think that perfect score was something you earned? Getting complacent already?" Ellie snapped, her voice tinged with

 disbelief.


She simply couldn't accept that Grace had achieved a perfect score on her own. In all her years of teaching, no student had ever done so-especially not a transfer with no decent academic performance.It just didn't add up.


The SAT would eventually reveal the truth-there'd be no room for tricks or shortcuts there. It would lay everything bare.


Grace finally turned to them, casually scratching her ear. "I thought a dog was barking just now," she said flatly. "Turns out it was just you talking. What were you saying again?"


Her words landed like a slap, and Ellie's and Gianna's expressions instantly darkened. A few student representatives stifled their laughter. They had long grown tired of Ellie's arrogance but never dared to speak up. Now, someone had finally said what they had only dared to think-and it was glorious.


"You-" Ellie began, nearly shaking with rage, but some lingering sense of reason held her back. This wasn't the right place to explode.


Just then, Terry's voice, charged with excitement,cut through the tension.


"The articles published by the students I mentioned earlier were all excellent," he declared, his tone lively,"but the most outstanding and impressive one is..."


He paused, letting the suspense build, his eyes sweeping across the room in search of someone.


"Grace Miller. Her insights on artificial intelligence were extraordinary-arguing not merely that Al replaces jobs, but that it propels the theory of surplus value into a quantum realm. This isn't just a scientific breakthrough; it's a clever critique of humanity's inflated sense of intellectual supremacy!"


Terry couldn't contain himself. His praise for Grace spilled out in a passionate torrent, each line more emphatic than the last. It was as though the entire academic world had been turned upside down by her work.
Gianna and Ellie sat frozen, their minds blank with shock. Even Johnny looked dazed, eyes wide with disbelief.



Grace? His adopted sister? Could she really be this remarkable?

###Chapter 76 Impossible To Stay Unnoticed


"Are you talking about Grace Miller?!" Gianna stood up, unable to contain her disbelief.


A cold wave of shock rolled through her. The very idea seemed absurd, like someone had decided to play a cruel joke. Grace, of all people?


Gianna's loud reaction caught Terry's attention. He glanced her way, only to realize Grace was seated quietly beside her.


Unfazed and composed, Grace sat with the same serene confidence she always carried. Despite his age, Terry found himself admiring her poise and self-assurance.


"Yes, that's right-Grace Miller," Terry assured, his tone unwavering. "If anyone's uncertain, my assistant will upload her published article to your school's forum.Feel free to check for yourself." The certainty in his words suggested he had no doubt that even the faculty would recognize the strength of Grace's work.


"Prof. Warren, there has to be a misunderstanding,"Gianna said, her voice tinged with desperation."Grace only came here after my uncle adopted her from some small-town orphanage. She hasn't even studied here for a full year." The thought that Grace could outperform her felt utterly impossible.Someone like Grace shouldn't have access to high-level resources, Gianna insisted inwardly. Surely the papers had been switched-maybe her own work was credited to Grace by mistake.



Picking up on Gianna's not-so-subtle accusation,Terry's assistant cut in, his response sharp and unflinching. "There's no mistake at all. The article belongs to Grace Miller. Do you honestly believe Professor Warren and I could mix up something so important? Both your paper and Grace Miller's will be posted for everyone to see. The truth will speak for itself."
For someone who had once been at the top of the class and had become Terry's protégé, the assistant's confidence in Grace's work carried considerable weight.


Still, Gianna refused to let go of her doubt, herlips parting to launch another protest, only for Terry to speak over her. "Actually, there's another reason for my visit," he announced, his tone shifting the mood in the room. "I'm searching for an exceptional student to join my team in the future. If they agree to my terms, I can guarantee direct admission to Summit University-completely tuition-free."


That announcement rippled through the classroom,igniting a surge of whispers and excitement. Rumors about Terry's visit had circulated for days, but hearing the offer firsthand sent a charge through the air.



Most students buzzed with the hope that the coveted spot might be theirs, though everyone expected Gianna would be chosen.

Gianna's eyes lit up with hope and expectation as she looked to Terry, longing for confirmation.


Not a single glance came her way. Terry's silence grew heavier by the second, slowly eroding her certainty. Gianna remembered introducing herself,convinced she'd made an impression-so why was she being overlooked now?


Before long, Terry put an end to any lingering confusion. "To be clear, I've already chosen who'll receive this opportunity. Grace Miller is my pick."


That blunt revelation left Gianna speechless. Ellie,equally thrown, struggled to understand how everything had turned upside down. Why Grace, of all people?


Ellie, finally regaining her composure, sprang to her feet. She pointed to Gianna first. "Prof. Warren, are you positive there's no mix-up? This is Gianna White..."



Her hand shifted toward Grace. "And that's Grace Miller."
Surely Terry had made an error; nothing else made sense.



A hint of irritation crept into Terry's reply. "I know exactly who's who. My eyes work just fine. One of them stands out for her looks, and I'd never confuse the two... not for beauty, and certainly not for brains."


Grace's reputation for beauty was hardly a secret;Terry's words left no doubt who was the one stood out.



Gianna's face burned, mortified by the public dismissal.


As if that weren't enough, Terry continued, "Besides,Grace Miller was once my mentor. It's not just about who I want; it's whether she's willing to accept the offer."



What in the world?! Was this some kind of twisted joke? Grace had actually been Terry's mentor once?!


It hit with the same jolt as being told pigs had sprouted wings and taken to the skies.
Grace had done her best to slip beneath the radar,keeping her head down and her steps quiet. Still, no matter how carefully she moved, it was impossible to stay unnoticed.


She pressed her fingers to her forehead and let out a long sigh, wishing for invisibility.


A soft complaint slipped from her lips. "Would it kill you to keep that quiet?"


"When people start doubting you, Grace, someone's got to set them straight. I wasn't about to let them keep questioning your talent." Terry offered a crooked smile, completely unapologetic.
###Chapter 77 Repeatedly Refusing Terry

Everyone just froze, eyes wide. They were still processing the fact that Grace was Terry's mentor.


Terry's reputation stretched far and wide. A brilliant mind, the kind you read about in the papers, with a squad of bodyguards sent straight from the top brass.



The idea that such an important figure, the sort the government kept under lock and key so rival nations wouldn't take him, had once learned from a teenager,felt almost like a practical joke.


Life, though, loved to serve up stories that made no sense.


Grace herself was a hidden treasure, her talents handpicked and shaped by people in high places. For her, mastering any art was effortless, and hacking came as easily as breathing. Computer code was nothing more than a playground for her mind.


Long before anyone had heard of Terry, he trailed after Grace, eager for her advice and direction.Every bit of his present-day glory traced back to those early days.


The first time he saw Grace, his jaw dropped. He reacted just the same way as everyone else noW-utterly shocked and in awe.


He no longer found any of this surprising. In fact,he'd traveled here for Grace alone.



Not long ago, he had figured that tracking her down again would be a real ordeal, but instead, Grace showed up at the school herself and dashed off a research paper without breaking a sweat.


Her seemingly offhand effort was anything but simple. Layers of meaning and clever observations ran through every paragraph, sparking revelations for anyone sharp enough to catch them. Terry knew at once that this piece was nothing short of extraordinary.


But for the ignorant people, he would have never dreamed of letting such brilliance go public on a mere forum.


He could count on one hand the number of people who, like Grace, had earned the title of prodigy in both artificial intelligence and hacking before hitting twenty. There had only ever been three.


The first hailed from the influential Pearson family,the second led the Clark household, and then there was Grace.



Among these celebrated minds, Grace held the distinction of being the youngest, a record nobody had managed to surpass.


With a calm yet unwavering voice, she said, "Prof.Warren, you have my apologies, but I do not wish to join your team, and I am not seeking a recommendation to Summit University."
Attending this school served a dual purpose for Grace: keeping her true intentions hidden from the watchful eyes of the southern faction and, even more importantly, honoring her parents' wishes.


Julia and Rodger, wanting nothing but the best for her,encouraged her to focus on her studies here. To respect them, she remained for a while longer.


Already holding two postdoctoral degrees, Grace saw little value in treading the same academic ground, planning instead to move on and chase after new ambitions.



That blunt rejection hit Gianna like a cold shock,slicing through her composure and leaving her stunned. It stung all the more because everything she craved seemed to come so effortlessly to Grace,who appeared utterly indifferent to those very things.Each word felt like another blow to her pride, leaving a heavy ache in its wake.


"I would never presume to ask you to join my team as a student," explained Terry, his voice filled with a nervous hopefulness. "Actually, I was hoping you might serve as an advisor, share you wisdom with us when you have the time."


Everyone witnessing the scene could only gape,astonished by the reversal: Terry's respectful plea,and Grace's cool detachment.


Even with such a golden chance handed to her,Grace remained unmoved. She responded once more, "That does not interest me."


Her mind was already set on more pressing matters,including tracking down the elusive "Devil" working for the northern faction-a task that left no room for distractions.



Securing even a junior spot in Terry's team was enough to keep most students up all night, lost in wild hopes and anticipation. However,Grace viewed the very thought as a headache waiting to happen,sidestepping it as if it were a trap laid in her path.


Observing Grace brush off such a rare invitation sent Gianna's temper soaring. Ellie, meanwhile, could barely contain her distress, her breath shallow with regret for scorning Grace before. Cursing her own actions, she realized she'd sabotaged any chance of joining the elite teaching ranks herself-leaving Anthony to claim the prize.


Unfazed by Grace's steady refusals, Terry tried once more, saying, "I promise we won't burden you. You could come by when you wish, and offer guidance only if you're in the mood. Would that be acceptable?" His persistence was nothing short of relentless, unwavering in his hope to win Grace over.


Gradually, the audience transitioned from begrudging acceptance to something closer to resignation, their spirits dulled by the back-and-forth between Terry's respect and Grace's cool indifference.



Despite heading a lab at the highest echelon of national research, Terry found himself rejected time after time by Grace.


The situation shocked everyone.


Of all those watching, only Gianna seemed truly bitter about Grace's dismissal. Many of the students,who had once dismissed Grace as a nobody,now found themselves quietly in awe, their attitudes shifting toward admiration.


Meanwhile, Grace paid no mind to the crowd's shifting moods. After weighing her options, she finally gave a small, resigned nod and responded,"Fine. I'll do it."


Refusing any longer, especially after Terry's very public request, felt almost inappropriate.


In the end, she chose to treat the whole thing as a small service for her homeland, a favor she could grant with minimal fuss.
###Chapter 78 Gianna's Reputation Crumbled
Finally gaining Grace's nod of agreement, Terry felt as if he had just won a Nobel Prize. His joy was so overwhelming,he could barely contain himself.


Terry-normally a man who measured every minute-had initially planned to stay at the school for only an hour. But swept up in his excitement, he extended his visit to half a day, eagerly discussing artificial intelligence and elaborating on the Nature paper he had recently published.


Once Grace's identity was revealed, she had wanted to quiet the swirling rumors. So, she joined Terry in presenting the current state of Al and its projected development over the next twenty years.


Her insights weren't just impressive-they far surpassed Terry's. She even clarified several of his points and seamlessly filled in technical gaps he had overlooked.


Once she began speaking in earnest, her explanation flowed naturally, accessible and profound. Everyone,from curious students to seasoned staff, found themselves captivated.


The teachers in the room couldn't resist pulling out their notebooks, jotting down notes with sincere attention.


Despite having no slides, no script, and no prior notice, Grace spoke with clarity and depth,effortlessly sharing her knowledge and revealing the strength of her foundation and remarkable intellect.


By the time Terry left, the audience still wasn't satisfied-they wanted more.


He had mentioned earlier that he would upload the papers written by Grace, Gianna, and a few others to the school forum for everyone to review and compare.


After the assembly ended, eager students rushed to the forum to read Grace's paper.


True to Terry's word, the paper was there-exactly as promised, leaving no room for exaggeration or fabrication.


Then came Gianna's turn. Her paper, which she had once considered insightful and sophisticated,appeared clumsy and incoherent in comparison.


"Did you hear? Gianna actually questioned Professor Warren, thinking he made a mistake, when her paper reads like pure garbage!" someone snorted.


"Seriously! And that old hag Ellie thought Gianna would become famous from this and she herself could gain a promotion," another student added.


"What a complete humiliation!"


The forum exploded with unanimous praise for Grace, practically deifying her, while Gianna and Ellie -once perched at the top-were thoroughly torn down.



Gianna's reputation crumbled. Now, she became the object of ridicule.


She broke down, crying uncontrollably in the restroom.



Sadly, no one came to check on her. She was left alone, humiliated, with nothing to show when facing the Holdens again.


In stark contrast, Johnny showed no visible reaction to Grace, who had so abruptly become part of his family and daily life.


Still, he couldn't resist the urge to read her paper secretly. And when he did, he was stunned. It was brilliant. Many Al principles he had previously found confusing suddenly made sense. The clarity of the paper lifted a mental fog he hadn't even realized was there.


He sat in the school library, lost in thought. Wasn't Grace just the orphan girl adopted from a small orphanage? How could she be so knowledgeable about these new technology, have such a broad viewpoint, and have such a long-term vision? How was it possible for someone from a tiny, less developed city to have access to such knowledge?


As Johnny sat there, buried in his own questions, he noticed Grace walking by.


"Hey, what are you doing here?" he called out,quickly stepping in front of her and pulling her aside.


If it had been anyone else, Grace would have brushed them off without a second thought. But this was Julia's youngest son. So, she humored him."Looking for some research materials."



In reality, she was there for a very different reason.She needed a quiet space to stealthily access a company's private network and search for criminal records.



She was on assignment from her superiors-an order she couldn't refuse, one with no room for failure.


"You? Looking for materials?" Johnny's voice held a strange tone-part disbelief, part curiosity. It wasn't clear whether he found her too brilliant to need to study, or too ordinary to bother.


Grace didn't care to unravel it. "Did you stop me just to ask that?"


"Well, not exactly," he replied, scratching the back of his head awkwardly. Curiosity finally got the better of him. "Where did you learn all that stuff? And... are you into hacking,too?"


For reasons he couldn't explain, he had a growing suspicion-Grace just seemed to know everything.


Just then, Grace spotted someone approaching-Beatrice. She was likely here for Johnny.


Something clicked in Grace's mind. Instead of answering his question, she asked one of her own."Johnny, are you really into Beatrice? Have you ever thought she might not be who she seems?"


"What's that supposed to mean?" he asked, brows furrowed. The sudden shift in topic caught him off guard.


"Like... maybe she's been cozying up to some older man behind your back," Grace said as Beatrice paused close by and quickly ducked behind a bookcase.


Beatrice was terrified.


Grace grinned.
###Chapter 79 Stirring The Pot

Beatrice hadn't expected Grace to say that to Johnny.Could Grace have actually noticed something?


No way. She had been extra cautious-picking quiet spots, always looking over her shoulder. There was no way Grace could have seen her with any man.


"What kind of garbage are you talking about!"Johnny snapped, his voice rising sharply with anger.


A few heads turned from nearby tables in the library,brows furrowed in irritation. He forced himself to lower his voice but still glared at Grace, clearly fuming. "Stop trying to stir things up between me and Beatrice. She's not that kind of girl. If you ever bad-mouth her again-even if Mom's around-I'll teach you a hard lesson!"


"Johnny, are you really saying you'd hit me-even if Mom were standing right there?" Grace looked at him,wide-eyed, her face a picture of innocence.


"-" His words caught in his throat.


He knew his mother had always sided with Grace. To an unfair degree. She'd spoil Grace endlessly and scold him for the smallest things. If she ever found out he laid a finger on Grace, she'd probably beat him herself and throw him out of the house.


Sometimes, he couldn't help but feel like he was the one adopted.


"Anyway, just don't say anything bad about Beatrice again. I trust her," he muttered, sounding far less sure of himself now.


"Alright. Mom asked you to come home early tonight for dinner. Don't stay out too late," Grace said as she turned to leave.


From behind, she looked like the same sweet girl as always-but up close, there was a mischievous curve to her lips.


Beatrice must have overheard them.
Sooner or later, the truth would surface. And now that Grace had caught on to Beatrice's game,Beatrice might react soon. Once she did, it would only be a matter of time before everything unraveled.


Grace hadn't forgotten how smug Beatrice had acted during the whole same bags fiasco.


Now that she had some free time, she figured it wouldn't hurt to stir the pot a little-especially if it meant exposing Beatrice.


Besides, she owed it to her parents to protect her clueless brother from being played like a fool.


"Dinner? As long as you're home for dinner, no one really cares if I show up or not," Johnny muttered, the bitterness slipping out before he could stop it.


Then, just as he remembered something important,he let out a soft curse.


He had wanted to ask Grace about hacking stuff. But somehow, she had completely thrown him off. He hadn't gotten to ask a single question before she 
walked off.


Then again... what would she know about internet and computers anyway?


"Hi, Johnny,"


a sweet, familiar voice said. Beatrice walked over with a bright smile that looked so natural.


Johnny's mood instantly lifted. That smile always worked on him.


"Are you here to study?"


"Mm-hmm." she nodded. "Exams are coming up, sol need to put in the extra hours."


Something about that reminded Johnny of Grace's question. "Do you study at home every day?" he asked suddenly. "You haven't... been going out or eating with anyone else, have you?"


Usually, Beatrice could've handled such questions with ease-made up some sweet excuse or laughed it off.

But after overhearing his talk with Grace, his questions instantly made her uneasy.


Guilt pressed down on her chest, and suddenly,every word he said felt like it was hiding a deeper meaning-like he was testing her without saying it outright.


She forced her nerves down and gave him a soft,practiced smile. "The exams are so close-l've been locked in with my books at home. I want to get into the best university in the city."


She even tilted her head and blinked sweetly,looking completely innocent.


The moment Johnny saw that face, any doubts he had vanished. He didn't question her further. Instead,he mentally scolded himself for listening to Grace's nonsense.



The Beatrice he knew, even with her modest upbringing, was hardworking and fulI of drive. Her smile could light up a room, and she always seemed genuinely kind. She'd often ask him to tag along to buy snacks and feed the stray cats and dogs.


There was no way a girl like her was mixed up with shady older men. Grace was probably just trying to stir things up-or maybe she'd gotten it all wrong!


Feeling guilty for ever questioning Beatrice, Johnny reached out and gently took her hand. "Would you tutor me sometime? I want to get into the same university."


The meaning behind his words was clear-he wanted to stay with her, even after graduation.


This love-struck boy would stay wNrapped around her finger, offering whatever support he could.


He didn't handle the family money, but he saved faithfully, and while it wasn't nearly as much as what she got from other men, it still added up.


Plus, he was good-looking, and his family name carried weight. He might not have much now,but he was bound to be wealthy someday. It was just a shame his mother was so tightfisted, never givinghim enough allowance.


Still, Beatrice planned to keep him close while quietly getting what she needed from other men.


For now, she tucked those thoughts away and gave a shy smile. "But my grades aren't as good as Gianna's. Wouldn't it be better to ask her instead?"


Of course, she didn't mean it. It was just part of her act.
###Chapter 80 Lost To The Same Person
Johnny immediately shook his head and said, "I don't want Gianna tutoring me.I only want you."


Though he and Gianna were related, their relationship had always been shallow, more for appearances than genuine connection. There was hardly any interaction between them outside formal occasions.


Johnny was well aware that Gianna, proud and self-assured, respected his brother solely because of his talent and status.



But when it came to him, she barely hid her disdain.Even though they were classmates, he had gotten in through his father's influence, while Gianna had earned her spot through sheer merit. That fact only deepened her contempt.


"Alright, if I have time after school, I'll tutor you,"Beatrice replied, her warm smile lighting up her face. Lately, she'd had a minor falling-out with her benefactor, which left her with time to spare.Entertaining Johnny was convenient-and it didn't hurt to keep him dangling.


Her smile was gentle and reassuring, the kind that soothed Johnny's restless heart. That was also part of the reason he was so drawn to her.






After leaving the library, Grace had planned to take a taxi home.


She had already let Julia know she'd be staying late to study, so there was no need for her to come pick her up.


Julia had responded with a flurry of cheerful emojis,even promising to make Grace a special dinner that night.


Grace thought about how Julia always insisted she eat more, which could be a bit much at times.


She wasn't trying to diet, and her fast metabolism meant she never gained weight easily. Still, her appetite had always been modest.


Just as she stepped through the school gate, a sleek,top-of-the-line Lamborghini glided to a stop in front of her.


It was a newly released model, with only three of its kind in the world. Grace, being a motorsport enthusiast, had followed its debut closely.


But considering her current role as a hardworking student, she'd set aside her dream of owning a car for the time being.


Now,seeing one up close, it was hard to look away.


What stunned her even more was the person stepping out of the car-it was none other than Colton.


"What a coincidence, we meet again," he said smoothly.


"What are you doing here?" Grace asked, lifting an eyebrow. "The anniversary of my alma mater is coming up,"Colton explained with ease. "The principal called personally and invited me to attend."


Grace found that odd. Someone like him didn't need to show up just to accept an invitation. "So why come in person now?" she asked, curious despite herself.



"I just finished discussing a few things with the principal," he replied casually.


"Alright," she said, not bothering to ask what they talked about. Business matters never interested her.


"Are you heading home? Let me give you a ride,"Colton offered, his tone leaving little room for refusal."You saved my life once. Offering you a lift is the least | can do."


He had gone out of his way to be considerate, and it would feel rude to turn him down. Besides, it spared her the effort of hailing a taxi-something her naturally lazy side welcomed.
So,without hesitation, Grace slid into the passenger seat.


As the car pulled away, Lizzie exclaimed, "Gianna,look. Grace Miller sure moves fast-looks like she's switched men again!"


Just moments earlier, Lizzie and Gianna had witnessed Grace stepping into a sleek, unfamiliar car with a man.



They hadn't seen his face-he had his back to them -but his towering height, commanding presence,and refined attire spoke volumes.


Even from behind, he radiated sophistication. And that car-flashy and impossible to miss-was in a league of its own.


"She's always had a flirtatious streak," Gianna replied, her voice calm, her face emotionless.Yet her words dripped with venom, betraying the irritation bubbling beneath her composed surface. "Given her lowly background, it's not surprising. Clinging to wealthy men is probably her way of running from the past."


"What a shame! Her cumulative scandals would seriously damage the Holden family's reputation if they were made public," Lizzie said, wanting to win Gianna over because she knew she didn't like Grace.



Gianna said nothing, but the frustration twisting in her chest was difficult to ignore.


Whether it was the recent exams or Terry's endorsement, she had lost-to the same person every time. Grace.


Even Ellie, her teacher, now seemed to harbor quiet regret over the choices she'd made.


Time after time, Gianna found Grace stood in her way, stealing the spotlight and pushing her further into the shadows.


But it didn't matter. With the upcoming anniversary celebration on the horizon, a wave of alumni-now influential figures in various fields-would be returning.
Rumor had it the head of the Pearson family would be among them. That meant the game wasn't over yet. She still had a chance. A chance to step on Grace and rise again in a blaze of glory.






"I've made a patch of Rejuvenation PilI. I'll bring some to you next time," Grace said suddenly, her voice steady as they drove through the city.


Thanks to Colton's support, Eliana no longer had to wait in frustration.


Grace never liked owing favors. Giving him some pills felt like a fair return-with a little interest.


After all, she'd earned far more from their last deal than she had ever expected.
###Chapter 81 Whose Enemy
"Next time? And when exactly will that be?"


Colton wasn't just making small talk-he wanted a solid answer. With Grace, things could easily be dragged out for weeks.


To Grace, it sounded like he was just eager to get his hands on the pills.


"There's no rush. The poison's already cleared from your system. Your body's back to normal. Whether you take those pills or not won't really make a difference now."


Colton didn't drop the subject. "So? When are you planning to give them to me?"


"Saturday sounds good? I don't have any classes then, so I can bring the pills to you myself," Grace said, her lips curving slightly. He really wasn't patient.
"Saturday's fine. Bring me the pils and I'll treat you to a meal." He added the offer as if it were no big deal, but that last part mattered more to him than he let on.



Grace didn't turn him down. Those pills didn't come cheap,and in return, a meal was a small ask.


After that, the conversation quieted. Neither of them was big on small talk, and the silence inside the car settled in fast-calm, still, almost eerie.


But Colton was used to silence. Being reserved and distant was second nature to him. Sitting quietly like this didn't feel strange at all.


Then they both noticed it. A car was following them.


Neither of them said anything. Instead, they both subtly glanced at the rearview mirror.


Colton pressed harder on the gas, hoping to lose the car behind them, but it was no use-the ones tailing them were skilled trackers. They were sticking close without letting up.
Colton's calm gave way to irritation. "Hold on," he muttered, and with a sharp twist of the wheel,the car jerked forward, swerving and drifting through traffic with practiced skill.


But the pursuers didn't back off. They matched him move for move and even rammed into the back of his car.



Even though Colton's car was reinforced and bulletproof, the vehicle chasing them was just as tough-clearly built for this kind of job.



Grace quickly realized this wasn't some random ambush. These people had serious, powerful backing.


Could it be the so-called "Devil" from the northern faction? Had they finally tracked her down?


Even though there were two factions, they all came from the same core organization, which made it hard to tell whether the attackers were from the southern faction or the northern faction.

 Only the person who gave the order would know for sure.



Colton's mind was going through the same possibilities. If his cover had been blown, maybe the southern faction had finally made a move to get rid of him.



Whoever they were, it was impossible to figure out right now. And with the chase getting more intense by the second, the only option left was to face them head-on.


Colton's car, built for speed and power, held its own with ease, making it tough for the pursuers to gain the upper hand.


They didn't care about crashing or about damage-they were clearly here to finish the job.


Out of nowhere, another car appeared, cutting them off and forcing Colton toward the edge of a narrow bridge.


There was no time to think. Jumping out would be

the safest option.


"Jump now!" Grace shouted, throwing the door open and leaping without waiting for his reply.


Colton reacted instantly. Before she even landed, he grabbed her mid-air and shielded her with his body as they tumbled down the embankment.


Thankfully, they hit soft grass instead of concrete,rolling roughly but escaping with just a few scrapes.


Above them, the two black cars didn't stop or check -they made a sharp U-turn and sped away,disappearing without a trace.


The way they moved-fast, focused, and without hesitation-made it clear they were professionally trained.


There was no doubt about it now-they had been sent by someone high up in the ranks.


Grace's calm gaze sharpened, a flicker of anger rising beneath the surface, while Colton's eyes narrowed, dark and dangerous.
"What just happened?" he asked. "I'm always direct with people. I don't have enemies. Are you sure this wasn't meant for you?" Colton played it cool, acting like he had nothing to do with it, casually trying to shift the blame onto Grace.



"I'm just a student," she replied, eyes wide with innocence."Why would I have enemies?"


Colton raised an eyebrow. "Right. A simple student.Not an underground miracle healer with a secret side job?"


"And you, Mr. Pearson, a company president with power and connections-shouldn't you be the one with a longer enemy list?" Grace shot back, not missing a beat.


Neither of them said it out loud, but the same thought ran through their minds. "This attack was meant for me-it had to be someone from the other side."


They held back from admitting it, worried that saying too much might expose who they really were.
Still, deep down, they both were sure those people hadn't shown up by chance. They were the targets.


"You're hurt. Let me take you to the hospital," Colton said as his eyes landed on the red scrapes scattered across Grace's arms.



They weren't deep, but they stood out-and for some reason, that made him feel strangely unsettled.


As for the southern faction, he fully intended to make them pay for it!


"No need. I'm a doctor. I'll clean it up and apply some ointment at home." Unfortunately, she hadn't brought any of her medicine today-if she had, the wounds would've started healing within hours.



Grace was already in a bad mood, and the thought of her mother seeing the scrapes and getting all worried only made it worse.


She clenched her fists slightly. She would never let go of the attackers from the northern faction. This wouldn't be forgotten.

 "No." Colton gave her just one firm word before pulling out his phone and calling Dominick to come pick them up and head to the nearest hospital.


Somehow, the assistant showed up almost instantly,proving that Colton was even more capable than she'd guessed, with a sharp, well-prepared team always at his side.
###Chapter 82 Not Dating





After having her scrapes patched up at the hospital,Grace ducked into the restroom for a moment.



Ready to rejoin Colton and leave, she spun on her heel, only to hear a voice she recognized instantly,thick with tears.



"Grace! Oh, my darling! Are you alright? I was worried sick!"



Julia's sudden appearance left Grace momentarily stunned. The evidence of her mother's sobbing was unmistakable-red, swollen eyes and an emotional disarray that spoke of minutes spent weeping.


Standing close by, Rodger looked equally stricken,anxiety carved into every line of his face.



Grace tried to offer a reassuring smile. "I'm okay,really.How did you find me here?"
"How could we not come the minute we heard about your car accident? It terrified us! I can't tell you how relieved I am to see you safe!"


Just hearing the news of Grace's crash had nearly sent Julia into a faint.


Fresh tears glimmered as Julia scanned Grace from head to toe, unable to hide her distress at the sight of those shallow, red marks on her daughter's skin.


"Mom, honestly, it's nothing-just a few scratches,"Grace assured her gently.


Rodger's concern deepened as he pressed the issue."Are you absolutely certain? I really think it's best for you to get a thorough examination. Sometimes injuries hide beneath the surface and only reveal themselves much later. What if something starts bothering you after we've already left? That's what worries me the most."



Nodding vigorously, Julia echoed his concern. "He's absolutely right! Let's have a doctor check you out from head to toe right away," she insisted. Any amount of waiting or extra cost was a small price for knowing Grace was truly alright.


Reaching for his phone, Rodger was ready to call a doctor, but Grace reached out and stopped him in his tracks.



"No need to worry, really-I know my own health better than anyone. Don't forget, medicine is my field," she insisted with a gentle but confident smile.


To prove her point, she spun around lightly and even bounced on her toes, almost daring them to doubt her flexibility and strength. She looked like she might break into a cartwheel any second.


Her liveliness finally eased some of their worry.Julia's tension faded just a bit, though she still clung to her motherly concern. "I should have come to fetch you myself. It's too risky for someone your age to go home by yourself."


The comment almost made Grace laugh. In truth, she was probably the last person in the world who needed protecting.
Switching gears, she threw out a question to shift the conversation. "So tell me-how did you two know to find me here?"


Julia, easily sidetracked, started to answer. But before she could finish, Colton made his entrance,freshly bandaged from his own treatment.


"It was Colton!" Julia blurted out in relief. "He told me what happened-if not for him, I'd have had no idea where to look. You really gave me a scare this time,sweetheart..." Her voice shook, threatening tears all over again.


A flicker of surprise crossed Grace's face. What business did Colton have talking with her parents?


Elite families often crossed paths, sharing connections through business, tradition, or even arranged marriages-none of that was out of the ordinary.


Still, Grace eyed Colton warily, unable to shake a wave of suspicion.

Wearing a look of harmless innocence, Colton explained, "While you were tending to your cuts,your mom's calls kept lighting up your phone. I went ahead and answered, thinking she'd want to know what was going on." He glanced over, his face full of apology. "Honestly, I wasn't snooping.I just thought it'd be worse not to answer her."



Julia broke into a bright smile, brushing off any concern. "No need to say sorry! Without your help,we'd never have known about the accident. If anything,I'm grateful."


Grace could only sigh, lips curving into a faint,bewildered smile.


In a quiet tone, she leaned closer to Colton and whispered, "Did you really have to tell my mom?I was on my way home anyway-she wouldn't have found out."


Telling her parents had never been part of the plan.Grace intended to slip home quietly, dab on her own custom ointment, and wake up the next morning with barely a mark left behind. No one would have guessed a thing.


A soft laugh escaped Colton as he leaned closer,lowering his voice to a private whisper. "I thought it'd be nice if your folks realized you and I... share a connection. Who knows, maybe you'll give me a proper introduction soon."


Grace stared, taken aback. "Wait-what's that supposed to mean?" The families were familiar with each other already, so what was the point in introducing him to her folks?


Meanwhile, Julia took in the sight of Grace and Colton murmuring together and saw something entirely different.


She gave Rodger a nudge, whispering,"Honey,look at those two... Aren't they just perfect? They seem so close-maybe there's already something going on between them!"



A fierce blush shot across Grace's cheeks."Mom!It's not like that. We're not dating!"
Rodger's posture stiffened at once, concern flickering in his eyes. "That's right. Girls your age shouldn't be thinking about romance just yet."


Colton could hardly hide his amusement as the scene played out. Everything was falling neatly into place. Instead of bristling at Rodger's sternness, he wore a smile.


"You have a point, Mr. Holden. Grace should be focused on life's bigger adventures before she even considers dating."
###Chapter 83 A Command He'd Regret





Rodger's suggestion met with immediate acceptance from Colton, who understood that Grace's time as a student was drawing to a close.


Whether she was finalizing her plans for college or not,she was never one to pour all her focus into textbooks. Academics alone never satisfied her restless mind. Secrets trailed in her wake,and her talents stretched far beyond school walls.


Soon enough, the day would come when Grace stepped out of academia and into the wider world,and Colton's predictions would be set in motion.


Julia leaned in with approval. "That's just it, Colton.Grace is young and impressionable. The last thing l want is for her to fall under the sway of the wrong crowd. If you have the chance, do me the favor of watching over her," she said, trusting Colton's judgment far more than her own sons'.
Grace's prospects would be well-guarded if Colton stood watch; no sensible man would dare cross that line.


"You have my word, Mrs. Holden. I'll see to it personally," Colton replied, calm and certain. There was no way he'd let any man get close to Grace.


Grace wanted to object, thinking that her mother's standards for "reliable" guardianship were questionable at best.


Nightfall crept in, and with a few parting words,Rodger and Julia gathered Grace and set off, leaving Colton behind.


The family had barely turned the corner when Dominick slipped from the shadows, his presence quiet but sure. "Sir, I've uncovered that those behind today's incident are connected to the higher-ups."


A sharp glint entered Colton's eyes. "Which side-southern or northern?"



Only the true powerbrokers could orchestrate
something like this, and Colton knew it.


Dominick looked away, feeling a bit awkward.
"Honestly... I haven't been able to confirm that yet."


Colton, however, had already put the pieces together. The supposed divide between north and south was more smoke than fire; in reality, they all answered to the same country.


That never stopped ambitious souls from splintering into rival camps, each one unable to share power for long.


In the end, none of it mattered to Colton. He was already convinced the old man from the southern faction was behind the trouble.


"If that's the case, there's no point keeping the research institute open at Frostveil Mountain," Colton said,his tone resolute.


Dominick hesitated, unsure if he'd heard right. "You mean...?"


A cold light glinted in Colton's eyes. "The southern
faction is cultivating all kinds of plants up there,isn't it? Wipe them out. I want them to regret crossing me."


The thought left Dominick uneasy. He couldn't help but offer a warning. "Word is, those plants belong to the female genius of the southern faction.Destroying them might cause an uproar."


People in power held her in high regard, and making an enemy of her was asking for trouble that lasted a lifetime.



Rumor had it she loved collecting rare things-strange plants, exotic insects, and even venomous snakes. Stories went around that anyone who ended up on her bad side never met a happy ending.


A dismissive smile played at Colton's lips. "Let her raise hell. I hope she does. The more she resents me,the better," he replied, never realizing that one day he would regret ever issuing that command.


He figured the only/ way to unmask that woman was to push her buttons until she revealed her true identity.


Any information about her had been carefully concealed by the southern faction, and every attempt to dig deeper had come up empty.


A respectful nod from Dominick signaled he understood. "Right away, sir," he replied, then slipped out to carry out the orders.






Meanwhile, at the Holden residence, it was already past dinner time. Johnny and James still lingered on the living room sofa, having waited for everyone to return.



Watching his family file in, Johnny immediately noticed that Grace looked perfectly fine, not a hair out of place, and it made him wonder if their parents had been duped by her antics once again.


He shot her a skeptical look. "Wasn't it said you were in a car crash? You look just fine to me," he remarked, his voice edged with disdain as he eyed her immaculate clothes.


"You had Mom and Dad running all over town,thinking something terrible happened. All that panic for nothing," he muttered, not hiding his irritation.


Julia, however, missed the tone entirely. "Oh, Grace,you should have seen how anxious Johnny was! He ran right over to check on you and nearly cried with relief," she responded, completely misunderstanding his sarcasm.



A twitch pulled at the corner of Grace's mouth. How did Julia always manage to mistake Johnny's biting remarks for genuine concern?


Johnny could barely contain his irritation at his mother's ability to twist every situation and almost let his frustration show.



From across the room, James finally broke his usual silence. "Now that we know everyone's all right, let's eat. You're probably all hungry."


Carrying the weight of being the oldest, James had a reserved nature and had begun taking on more responsibility, working closely with Rodger on family business.



Julia, beaming with pride, latched onto his words."See? James cares about you. He doesn't want anyone missing dinner. Let's all sit down together,"she said, convinced of her eldest son's reliability and warmth.



Johnny rolled his eyes at his mother's habit of making every remark about Grace, especially since James hadn't singled out anyone in particular.


He chose not to argue, instead trailing after the others as the family made their way to the dining table.


A sense of nostalgia washed over Julia as she realized how long it had been since the entire family had shared a meal.


"Having Grace at home brings such joy. Even James shows up for dinner more often these days," Julia remarked, her voice soft with sentiment.

James managed a gentle reply. "Of course. Family meals matter, especially when Grace is here," he said, his words warm, though his gaze remained distant, subtle, and unnoticed by most.
###Chapter 84 Not Sibling Care
The emotional toll of Grace's accident weighed heavily on Julia. Whether it was the shock or simply exhaustion from so many tears, she found herself drained by the end of dinner. She decided to wash up early and retreat straight to her room.


Nevertheless, she refused to let her nightly ritual slide. Bringing a mug of warm milk to Grace before bed had become almost sacred-a habit rooted in her belief that her daughter, still too thin from her difficult years before joining their family, needed every ounce of nourishment and care.


Evenings always saw Julia knocking on Grace's door,milk in hand and a ready excuse to share stories or simply linger together a bit longer.


Fatigue,however,left Julia spent tonight.


Passing the baton, she asked her son to deliver both the milk and a bit of brotherly warmth-to use this
moment to grow closer to Grace.


James, ever the dutiful and thoughtful son, never hesitated when his mother called on him. He gave a quick nod and set off down the hall.


It wasn't long before he stood outside Grace's room,mug in hand, tapping softly at the door.


"Come in."



Seeing James enter instead of Julia caught Grace off guard. That nightly ritual of milk and quiet conversation was Julia's domain, a rare, cherished moment they both looked forward to.


James crossed the threshold, offering a gentle smile."Mom's wiped out tonight, so she asked me to take over milk duty," he explained, his tone calm and kind,his eyes soft with warmth.


Yet, behind the kindness, Grace detected something else-a faint but unmistakable sense of distance.



She'd sensed it for a while now. Outwardly, James acted as loving as any brother, his gestures echoing
their parents' affection, but something always felt held back. His gaze, steady and quiet, never quite lost that subtle reserve.


Perhaps it was all just a performance for Julia's sake,James putting on the mask of the attentive older brother because that was what his parents expected to see. Or maybe, at his core, he was simply the kind of person who kept a subtle barrier between himself and the world.


Grace found herself leaning toward the former,suspecting that genuine affection wasn't part of the equation for James.


Honestly, she couldn't blame him. She was still the newcomer here, and expecting him to treat her like real family right away would have been naive.


She lifted the mug with a small nod. "Thanks,James." The words were simple, but polite.


A sip brought comfort-Julia's careful touch evident in every warm, familiar swallow.

James quietly observed, eyes catching on the milk's pale mark on the edge of her lip-a fleeting glimpse of innocence, making her seem much younger than she usually did.


For a heartbeat, the urge to reach over and wipe it away nearly won out, but awkwardness crept in, and he pulled back.


There she sat, swaddled in pink pajamas, her hair damp and curling softly over her shoulders-a gentle domestic scene.


He weighed the idea of offering to heIp dry her hair,the words on the tip of his tongue. The part he was meant to play was obvious, but stepping into it felt somehow false. Better to stay silent than force a gesture that wasn't real.


Grace sat quietly, as unbothered by the hush as ever,but she could tell James was uncomfortable with the stillness. Determined to keep the peace in the Holden household, she considered breaking the silence, hoping to ease whatever tension lingered between them.
Oddly enough, she never experienced this kind of strained silence whenever Colton was nearby. Even in wordless moments, his presence felt easy-natural,like breathing.


Yet with James, and truthfully with most people, that comfortable feeling just never seemed to settle in.


Eventually, James broke the hush. "Go ahead and finish your milk. Then get to bed early. You've got classes in the morning."


Grace responded with quiet courtesy, "Alright. You should get some rest too. Work comes early. Good night." She always tried to mirror politeness, still hoping to carve out her own place in this family.


He gave her a brief nod, turning to leave-then stopped short, seemingly on impulse. Reaching for the towel tossed over the chair, he set it gently atop her wet hair.


"You really shouldn't wash your hair so late," James scolded, keeping his tone soft. "And make sure to dry it off next time, or you'll wind up sick." With that,
he slipped out of her room.


For a moment, Grace paused, rubbing the towel into her hair, a flicker of surprise lighting her face.


Just now, she'd caught something unfamiliar in his gaze-an absence of the usual distance, maybe even a hint of warmth.


Was it possible he'd changed his mind about her? Or had she been reading him wrong from the very start?


Grace never wasted energy obsessing over questions that had no clear answers. Letting go of uncertainties was one of her quiet strengths; she never saw the point in tying herself up with needless worry.


Nevertheless, she reached for the hair dryer,diligently drying her hair before climbing under the covers for the night.


Meanwhile, in the house, James had barely stepped into the hallway before being grabbed and yanked sideways into the next room.
Johnny,waiting just outside his own door, was the culprit. His grip was firm and his glare sharper than usual. "James, what's with you suddenly acting so friendly toward her?"


Sharing a wall made these late-night ambushes all too easy.


With a steady voice, James replied, "She's part of our family now. That's what Mom wants, and I'm just following her lead. Why does it bother you if I treat her kindly?"


Patience laced James's words as he tried to bridge the gap with his younger brother. "You might not be Grace's biggest fan, but she's always respectful and never gives anyone trouble. There's no harm in showing her a bit of sibling care."


Johnny cut right through the explanation, saying,"Cut it out. I've watched you. That's not how someone looks at a real sister."



For a split second, something complicated flickered in James's expression-something too fast to pin down.



"Getting used to someone new in the family isn't automatic," James admitted, voice turning earnest as he slipped into his big brother role. "Still, it's up to us to make her feel like she belongs. That's what I'm going to do-and you should try,too."
###Chapter 85 Adrianna's Glowing
Johnny found himself wondering if he truly understood James anymore.


There had been a time when he was certain they were close, their small age gap making Johnny feel as though he knew everything about James.


Now, he could not shake the feeling that he was staring at someone completely unfamiliar.


Was it possible that James had fallen under Grace's spell too, just like their parents had?


Not long ago, Johnny was convinced that he and James were the only ones in sync within the family.Was he wrong?


"James, don't tell me you're another one who's fallen for Grace's act. Why should I have to treat her like a sister when even Gianna never got that title? And another thing-Mom actually gave her the special
mug. The one you just brought in was supposed to be for me and Mom!" he blurted out.



James heard his brother's frustration and simply shook his head, finding Johnny's behavior more childish than ever. Arguing about a mug seemed completely ridiculous to him.


"Just give it a rest. Like Mom said, we're supposed to be one big family." James spoke those words to Johnny, though it sounded like he was reminding himself too.


He finished what he had to say and walked out,unwilling to waste more time bickering with Johnny.


"Yeah right, as if I care about playing happy family with her. Grace is way too sneaky," Johnny muttered to himself, even though James was gone.


There was never a moment when Johnny truly liked Grace. He always felt like her presence left him on the outside of his own family.


The one thing he refused to forgive was how she
tried to come between him and Beatrice, making it sound like Beatrice was seeing some older man! The idea seemed impossible to him.


The more he dwelled on it, the more agitated he became, so Johnny reached for his phone and sent Beatrice a message, hoping she would reassure him.


Even after waiting quite a while, he received no reply from her. He assumed she had probably already gone to sleep, since she always stuck to her bedtime schedule.


At that very moment, however, Beatrice was resting in another man's arms.


Her parents barely paid attention to her, wrapped up in their own concerns, so they never questioned where she went or what she did. Things were much different for Johnny, who grew up under strict rules at home.







As the days passed, all the seniors became completely absorbed in preparing for the SATs,pouring their energy into this single pursuit.


With so much pressure in the air, only a small handful seemed calm and at ease.



A wave of happiness washed over Adrianna today.


The dark mark on her face, which doctors once claimed could never be removed, had vanished entirely.


Grace took one look and offered a nod of satisfaction. "That's impressive. The treatment worked even faster than I expected.It's half a month early."


Clearly, Adrianna had followed every instruction closely, and that effort paid off with such amazing results.



Gratitude filled Adrianna's voice as she squeezed Grace's hand. "Grace, I can't thank you enough. If it weren't for your help, I wouldn't feel as confident as l do now."
For a while now, that dark mark had been fading, and that alone had lifted her spirits.


This morning, when she woke to see her skin clear and glowing, a burst of pure joy ran through her.


Beauty meant a great deal to Adrianna, so she could not help but feel deeply grateful and thrilled.


"Try not to worry about how you look. You have a beautiful soul. You know, there's beauty everywhere,but finding someone with a beautiful soul is rare. Just believe in yourself," Grace explained.


Of everyone in the class, Adrianna stood out as Grace's dearest friend, and seeing her this happy made Grace feel truly delighted.


"Maybe so, but I owe you so much. If there's ever a day you need anything, I'll be there right away!"Adrianna said, her voice full of genuine gratitude,secretly thinking she would do almost anything for Grace. Even if it meant blurring the lines between friendship and something more.
Grace just laughed it off and waved her hand. "You don't need to make a big deal out of it."


Honestly, compared to treating Colton's serious condition, helping Adrianna with a mark feIt like a minor favor.


Her thoughts drifted to Colton again. For reasons she could not explain, he kept finding his way into her mind.



She gave her head a quick shake, determined to push thoughts of him away.


A voice rang out, surprised and loud. "Wait, did Adrianna really lose that giant mark?"


Someone else chimed in, "How did she pull it off?Without that mark, she's actually pretty, even prettier than Beatrice!"



"Looks like she didn't just lose that mark. Her skin's so much clearer and brighter. She's glowing now!"


Many classmates had been watching Adrianna's progress quietly, noticing every little change.

Now that her skin looked so healthy and the ugly mark was gone, the change seemed more impressive than anything a surgeon could do.


Charles could not help but notice how different Adrianna looked, too.


News traveled quickly, and once the girls in the class realized Grace was behind the transformation, all of them wanted to know her secret.


After all, almost everyone wanted to feel beautiful.
###Chapter 86 Becoming Popular

Whispers and curious glances had swirled around for ages before a girl finally found the nerve to step up to Grace. "Hey, Grace... where did you get that spot-fading skincare? Would you mind sharing the name?|saw how well it worked on Adrianna."


Grace met the question directly. "That's actually a homemade formula-a family secret. You won't find it on any store shelf."


It was a blend she'd invented herself, something she wasn't planning to share widely.


A flicker of disappointment flashed across the girl's face, though she couldn't help herself from trying again. "Well... could I maybe buy some from you?picked up way too many sunspots on my last trip,and nothing I tried seems to help."


This time, Grace responded without hesitation,"Sure,I can make you a jar."
Not expecting such an easy yes, the girl was left blinking, her prepared pitch suddenly unnecessary.Her surprise melted into a bright grin. "That's wonderful! Just let me know the price and I'll send you the money right now!"


At this school, nearly every student either had deep pockets or a sharp mind, and most had both.


Draped in luxury brands, most of these students simply assumed that Grace's skincare must be both high-quality and within their budgets-everyone seemed eager to get their hands on a bottle.



"Grace, count me in too! Could you make one for me?"



"I'm looking for something to help brighten my complexion and clear up some breakouts. Is there anything in your collection for that?"



Before long, the group treated Grace as if she ran her own little beauty shop, crowding around with requests and wish lists.
None of them realized that Grace's formulas were, in fact, Dr. Q's masterpieces-priceless creations in the world of skincare.



Put up for auction, these products could easily rake in millions, far beyond what any typical student allowance could handle.



But in the spirit of friendship, Grace surprised her classmates. "Don't worry about paying. We're al friends here, so these are on the house."


Her classmates received the offer as a gesture of goodwill-a thoughtful present rather than a transaction.


At first, a few wondered if they'd misheard, but when Grace's words were confirmed, delight swept through the group.


Even those who had once kept their distance or harbored quiet doubts about Grace now found themselves warming up, drawn in by her kindness.


Adrianna couldn't help but notice the change,

genuinely surprised at how easily the class atmosphere shifted to one of friendliness and acceptance-and she felt a quiet pride in the moment.



There was no denying it: the beauty products Grace shared worked miracles, delivering results that other brands couldn't even promise.


Within days of trying Grace's skincare, the girls in her class saw their reflections change-clearer,brighter,with not a single side effect to worry about.


This was worlds apart from the store-bought brands,which too often left users with lingering problems.


It didn't take long for word to travel; soon, stories of the "Grace effect" were circulating through every hallway and lighting up the school's online forums.


Previously, most of these girls blended into the background, never quite standing out for their looks.


Some were blessed with good bone structure but plagued by stubborn skin; others had clear skin but forgettable features, while a handful had both but always seemed to fade from memory.


Grace's gifts changed all that. Now, their complexions glowed, their personal style sharpened,and they walked with quiet self-assurance.


Adrianna's transformation stood out the most. Once written off as the class's least attractive, she lost the dark mark on her face and emerged as a genuine beauty, drawing comparisons to Beatrice for charm and poise, though still falling a bit short of Gianna.


As friendships with Grace warmed, so did the girls'willingness to listen. They eagerly followed her tips on clothing and hair, their appearances leveling up with each suggestion.


Confidence followed. It showed in the way they moved, the way they laughed, the way they met the world directly.


Grace quickly found herself the center of attention,admired and adored by nearly everyone in her year.
Her positive influence didn't go unnoticed;classmates who benefited from her help cherished her all the more.


Even students outside her class felt pangs of envy,wishing they could be close to Grace.



Soon enough, the demand became too great to ignore. Through friends, classmates, or shy notes slipped into her hand, beauty-obsessed girls from all over campus started asking if there was any way to buy Grace's magical creations.



Turning down a business opportunity wasn't in Grace's nature-she decided there was no reason not to profit from her talents.



For students from other classes, though, her price tags weren't the generous deals she'd given her classmates. Instead, she set rates that reflected the true value of her formulas-numbers more suited to luxury boutiques than school hallways.


The jaw-dropping prices left some girls reeling.
Sticker shock set in. Who could actually pay so much just for skincare?


A few were desperate enough for flawless skin to scrape together the money, but most quickly gave up after hearing the cost.


Lizzie complained to anyone who'd listen. "That bumpkin Grace Miller claims she made those creams herself, but look at what she's charging! Six figures for a small jar-she might as well be robbing us in broad daylight." Secretly, she wanted nothing more than to get her hands on a jar.


Gianna, still smarting from her own recent failures,rolled her eyes and offered advice with forced indifference. "She has always had a knack for scheming. Just let her be. You should focus on your grades and getting into a good university."


Since Terry's last visit, Gianna's usual self-assurance had all but vanished, replaced by a constant undercurrent of nerves.


Meanwhile, Ellie was watching her own career slip through her fingers. About all she could do was push Gianna to keep her head down and aim for the top universities in the country.


Otherwise, all the energy she'd poured into Gianna would have been wasted.

###Chapter 87 What Matters Is Who You Are
Lizzie's real aim was to stir up Gianna, hoping she'd explode at Grace for the outrageous pricing.


Gianna,however, wasn't about to take the bait. She prided herself on her flawless skin and her upbringing as part of the Holden family, and she saw no point in tossing away good money on Grace's fancy concoctions.


Landing a spot at her top-choice university was her priority-she could always settle old scores with Grace once she'd secured her future.


Realizing that Gianna remained perfectly composed,Lizzie had to set her plans aside for now.


Meanwhile, Beatrice found herself growing increasingly anxious.


Fear crept in as she wondered if Grace had

uncovered her secret relationship with that much older man. She'd planned to play it safe, but lately,the man's attention and the gifts had dried up.



Depending on Johnny wasn't much help either. He hadn't started working yet, and every penny he spent still had to pass through his parents' hands.


Their rules about money bordered on the absurd.Johnny's allowance was a fraction of what Grace got -hardly enough to fund Beatrice's tastes.


If Beatrice hadn't met Julia and seen the uncanny resemblance between mother and son, she might have suspected Johnny was the one who'd been adopted.


With Johnny's limited resources, Beatrice's lavish habits were in jeopardy. For now, he would have to be her last resort.



She couldn't help but notice that those long nights spent keeping her sugar daddy entertained had started to show on her skin. The glow she once had was gone, replaced by a sallow, tired look-no wonder the man was losing interest.


It was clear to Beatrice that she needed Grace's famous skincare now more than ever.


Once, she would have laughed at the idea that Grace could offer anything of value. But after watching Adrianna's dramatic transformation-witnessing the former laughingstock become one of the school's beauties-Beatrice found herself unable to argue with the results.



"Leave this to me, Beatrice. There's no way she'll have the guts to humiliate you with a flat-out rejection." Chloe Robinson-Beatrice's loyal sidekick and regular beneficiary of her generosity-didn't hesitate to take the lead.



Without wasting time, Chloe tracked Grace down.


"You're just out to scam people, aren't you? Selling some random, unapproved cream for an arm and a leg-who do you think you are?"


Grace barely glanced her way. "Nobody's forcing you to buy. In fact, I might refuse even if you change your mind."


"Careful. I could easily file a complaint. You're pushing unregulated stuff and breaking the law."Chloe tried to play tough, hoping a threat might get her somewhere.


Grace just gave a small, unconcerned shrug. "Go ahead. All my products are fully certified-top-tier quality,in fact."


The truth was, her formulas had been crafted for the wives of presidents and visiting royalty. If Chloe ended up with one, it would be pure charity.


"You-" Chloe faltered, caught off guard by how unshakable Grace remained. She'd expected panic,maybe even some groveling, Instead, Grace seemed untouchable-cold and unbothered, not budging an inch.


Clearly, Chloe had misjudged her opponent.


"If it's out of your price range, just admit it. There's 
no need to throw around threats or drag Grace's name through the mud." Adrianna had always been the quiet one, rarely drawing attention. Yet with Grace by her side, she'd found a boldness that left no room for bullies, even when her voice trembled,she stood her ground.


A harsh laugh escaped Chloe. "You? Acting tough with me, you pauper? Just because you scrubbed up alright, you suddenly think you can play in my league?"


The very idea that Adrianna-once the overlooked,awkward girl-now dared to talk back was enough to make Chloe seethe.


Grace regarded Chloe with a raised brow, her stare cool and faintly amused. "Did you just call Adrianna poor? Are you really that clueless?"


She'd taken the time to learn about Adrianna's background. Three generations of military service, a direct descendant of a general, and both parents currently holding high-ranking posts-Adrianna's roots ran deep.
Yet here was Chloe, dismissing her as some penniless nobody.


That was what happened when people never looked beyond the surface.


Chloe gave a scoff, trying to hold onto her confidence. "Obviously, she's got nothing. Or did you think she was some trust fund princess? Is that wvhy you're clinging to her now?"


It was clear Chloe thought she'd figured it all out-that Grace must have befriended Adrianna for status or money.


She wasn't above snooping, either. After helping out with admin work, Chloe had peeked at more than one student's file.


Other than Charles Pearson, most students'backgrounds weren't impressive.


Her first attempt at social climbing had been with Charles, but he brushed her off without a second glance. Once it became clear that Johnny was completely wrapped up in Beatrice, she wasted no time latching onto Beatrice instead.


When it came to Adrianna, though? Chloe had seen her student record herself-nothing impressive in the background column. She believed Adrianna sat at the bottom of the school's unofficial pecking order, just an ordinary kid whose spot at Briskvale High was likely earned through sheer hard work.


Adrianna's nerves showed as she rushed to speak up. "Grace isn't like that," she insisted, glancing anxiously in Grace's direction.


Growing up in a household led by decorated officers,Adrianna's life was marked by discipline and humility.Her family's achievements were never something to flaunt, and she'd learned early on to keep her heritage in the background. She wanted friendships based on genuine connection, not on status or background.


Her mother's words rang in her mind: "Real friends love you for you, not for your last name. Just a couple of true friends are enough for a lifetime."

If Grace was going to feel ashamed by her, Adrianna figured it was better to be upfront.


After all, Grace was the one person who'd helped her shed old insecurities and find her sense of self-a friend like no other.


Grace's lips curved in a gentle smile. "That's right,"she answered softly. "What matters is who you are,not your family tree."


She knew better than anyone how little background should matter-her own beginnings were in an orphanage, and she'd never judge someone from a good,honest family.
###Chapter 88 Romance Could Wait
Grace's soft smile, paired with her gentle words, sent a comforting warmth right through Adrianna.


A rush of affection made Adrianna's heart skip. If she wasn't careful, she'd end up idolizing Grace outright.


Chloe rolled her eyes at the whole display, not bothering to hide her annoyance. "Wow, the friendship here is so moving I might cry. Listen,Beatrice is set on getting that beauty cream. If you refuse her, Johnny's going to be furious, and life with the Holdens will turn ugly for you."


At that, Grace arched an eyebrow. "Turn ugly for me?You do realize, right? My mom absolutely dotes on me-she's never been one to favor sons. I get spoiled far more than Johnny ever has."


In the past, Grace might have doubted her place,but now there was no question: Julia treated her like a little princess, showering her with love and luxuries.
She continued, a sly edge in her voice, "Didn't you catch Johnny's latest complaint to Beatrice? My mom's a platinum member at every major designer house.The shoes, the bags, the clothes she buys for me-they're all limnited edition, bought in sets. Johnny only gets that kind of attention at Christmas and his birthdays."


When it came to women like Chloe, nothing worked better than highlighting the exact things they longed for most.


Fuming, Chloe let out a huff. "You spoiled brat," she spat, her jealousy plain as day, but she had no choice but to stalk off.


Just as she turned to leave, Grace's voice rang out,cold and clear. "And Chloe, you might want to tell Beatrice this: if she betrayed Johnny, she'd better be ready for payback. Don't say | didn't give fair warning."


"What are you implying? Beatrice would never betray Johnny!" Chloe stopped in her tracks, caught off guard. She tried to sound indignant, but the defensiveness in her voice betrayed her. "Quit trying to start trouble between them!"


Grace just lifted her shoulders in a small shrug,opting to let the conversation drop.


The gesture only made Chloe more certain that Grace was out to cause drama. She shot Grace one last scowl before storming off.


As Chloe's figure disappeared down the hall, Grace's mind started to turn over what she'd just seen.


Apparently, Beatrice's involvement with an older man was something even Chloe didn't know about.


Then again, what girl would ever confess to her friend that she had found herself a sugar daddy?


In any case, Grace doubted Chloe would prove loyal if things got ugly. Their friendship struck her as shallow, more convenient than genuine.


After Chloe was gone, Adrianna stepped closer and said softly, "Grace, there's something I haven't told you. The truth is... my parents aren't ordinary
  workers. They're actually in the military..."


Words tangled on her tongue, and for a moment she simply fell silent, unsure how to explain without saying too much.


Because of the sensitive nature of her parents' work -always shrouded in secrecy-she was bound by more than just family loyalty. Even she was kept in the dark about the true details of their assignments.


Grace caught the hesitation and responded with easy reassurance, "You don't have to explain anything to me. I'm not like Chloe or Beatrice-I don't get hung up on background or status. All I want is for you to stay yourself, and for our friendship to stay solid." Power and poverty meant little in Grace's eyes; she'd met people from every walk of life, and none of it ever changed what really mattered to her.


"Grace,you really are the best! Honestly, if I were a guy, l'd propose to you on the spot!" Adrianna threw her arms around Grace, utterly delighted, the picture of a devoted fan.
There was truth in Grace's words-so long as they stayed true to themselves, nothing could threaten the bond they shared. All those other details faded into insignificance.


Grace paused, a hint of mischief in her eyes. "Well,technically, we're not old enough for marriage yet."


Romantic feelings for women had never sparked in her,and there wasn't a man on her radar either.


Right now, her mind was set on her life and goals-romance could wait.






Meanwhile, Chloe was fuming elsewhere. "Isn't it ridiculous how full of herself Grace Miller has become? First, she refuses to sell her beauty creams for a fair price, then she tries to slander you and wedge herself between you and Johnny! Honestly,she has no shame. People say she's always seen with strange men in flashy cars-who knows what she's realy up to? And now she dares accuse you of betraying Johnny!"
Chloe poured out her loyalty to Beatrice, but her words only made Beatrice's anxiety grow sharper.


Already uneasy from guilt, Beatrice couldn't take Grace's threats lightly. Waiting around for disaster wasn't an option-she needed to act.


"Forget her," Beatrice retorted, trying to sound confident. "I'll talk to Johnny myself. If I play it right,he'll make sure Grace coughs up that cream. Once that's done, you'll get your share too."


Hearing Beatrice's promise lit up Chloe's face. She wasted no time in sliding over and looping her arm through Beatrice's. "You're amazing, Beatrice. You always look out for me."


Beneath it all, Chloe was desperate for her own taste of beauty.


"That's what friends are for-I'll always have your back." Beatrice assured her, sounding proud and self-assured.



There was no doubt in Beatrice's mind.With Johnny so firmly under her sway, she believed getting what she wanted would be a breeze.


As soon as lunch rolled around, Beatrice wasted no time bringing up the subject with Johnny.


"Wait, you want Grace's skincare stuff?" Johnny blinked in surprise.


Sure, he understood the obsessian girls had with skincare-and he cared plenty about his own looks-but could Grace's concoctions really be worth all the hype?


He couldn't help but wonder how her products had become such a craze throughout the school.
###Chapter 89 Stay Away From Johnny
"Hey, did you see how Adrianna Walsh got rid of that dark mark on her face? l've been up all night studying, and my skin's been acting up. Can you ask your sister if I could get some of her stuff too?"


Beatrice knew how to get her way with Johnny. A little charm, a sweet tone-he usually gave in without much resistance. Today should be no different.


But to her shock, Johnny replied without hesitation,"No,I can't."


Beatrice's smile faltered.


Johnny must've sensed the tension and felt he was too blunt. It was rare for him to feel uneasy. "Don't get me wrong, Beatrice," he said quickly. "I just don't think you should take Grace's products too seriously.She's always mixing random stuff without any clear source. It's not exactly... safe. What if it messes up your skin in a few weeks? It's not worth the risk."
Beatrice opened her mouth to push back-she had made a promise to Chloe and didn't want to seem unreliable.


Johnny had a point. If her face broke out or worse,it'd be a disaster. No apology would fix that.


"My mom's got memberships with all the major skincare brands," Johnny added, trying to soften the blow. "I'll get you something better. Sound good?"Since it was the first time Johnny had ever turned Beatrice down, guilt crept in quickly, and he rushed to make it up to her.



In his mind, asking Grace for anything was complicated. He didn't want to owe her, and he definitely didn't want to deal with his mother's suspicions if she caught wind of this.


His family didn't know he was dating, and the thought of their probing questions made him uneasy.


Beatrice perked up. "Johnny, you're the best." Even if she only got a little at a time, luxury skincare from top brands was more than most girls could dream of.

She couldn't complain.


Johnny relaxed a little when he saw her smile again,but deep down, he felt drained. This was what girls liked,right? Being spoiled?


After lunch, Beatrice claimed she needed a nap and parted ways with Johnny. In reality, she had another man to meet.



Most people would think this could be exhausting,sneaking off between classes like this-but to her, it was thrilling. After all, being spoiled by rich men of all kinds and showered with gifts was the kind of life most average-looking girls could only dream about.


Beatrice was not able to rest, and by afternoon, the effects of skipping rest caught up with her.


The next class was PE-thankfully. She could fake feeling unwell and sneak off to the infirmary to rest.


She was halfway there when she saw a face she didn't want to see.



It was Grace.

In her memory, Grace always acted like she enjoyed being on her own. Maybe it was because no one had the patience to handle her attitude, let alone try to be her friend.Beatrice had been wanting a face-to-face with Grace for a while, and now that the moment was here, she wasn't going to waste it.


"Why are you sitting here all alone? Where's your sidekick, Adrianna?" Beatrice's tone was smug,confident that her opening jab would get under Grace's skin.


But Grace didn't flinch. She sat on a bench, still, eyes closed, like she hadn't heard a word.


Beatrice frowned, thinking maybe Grace had dozed off. She stepped closer, dropped the soft-girl act,and said sharply, "You don't have PE now. Sitting here like this, aren't you scared of getting a demerit for skipping class?"


Still, no response. Beatrice suddenly felt foolish, like she was talking to a statue.


"Are you deaf or what?!" she snapped, her voice
louder now, fueled by frustration. At last, Grace opened her eyes just a sliver.


"Are you dumb or something? I heard you barking the whole time like a stray. Does Johnny know you act like this?"



Beatrice's breath caught in her throat. So Grace had heard her all along and deliberately ignored her-just to make her squirm.


"You look like a madwoman," Grace said calmly,leaning back like she had all the time in the world.


"You've got some nerve insulting me! I'm warning you-l recorded all this. I'll show it to Johnny!"


"Be sure to include the part about which guy you were sweet-talking today. No sleep at night, no rest at noon, those dark circles are no joke."


"Shut your mouth!" Beatrice's heart skipped. How did Grace know that? Had she bugged her? It was uncanny-too specific to be a guess.


"You know I'm telling the truth." Grace's voice lost all sweetness. The calm, kind front she wore for the world had vanished. She chose who deserved it--and Beatrice didn't.



She looked at Beatrice with disdain. Johnny really deserved better.


"Slander me again without proof and I'll sue you for defamation!" Beatrice snapped, trying to sound tough,though her voice cracked a little at the end.


Grace tilted her head. "You really are gifted."Beatrice blinked. A compliment? She straightened slightly. Well, it wasn't a lie. She was talented.


But then Grace added, "You really have a talent for keeping your cool, even when your dirty little secret is out in the open. I warn you, stay away from Johnny.I couldn't care less about the rest of your sugar daddies."



Grace rarely got involved in things that weren't her business. She was known for being cold and distant.


Despite her intellect and eerie calm, she lacked certain emotional traits. Still, the Holden family had filled in those missing parts well enough-especially when it came to protecting what mattered.
###Chapter 90 Giving Her Something Real To Cry About
Grace's genes were anything but ordinary-a handpicked blend of the brightest and strongest the elite world had to offer.


From her earliest days, she outpaced other children by leaps and bounds, mastering skills before most could even talk.


Still, all those years working in the shadows for her country had turned her into more of a tool than a person, moving through life without a hint of emotion.



Joining the Holden family marked a turning point-now, she was wrapped in genuine affection. She became personal and human.


Beatrice's voice trembled as she stammered, "I...I haven't done anything! Quit making up stories! If you've got something on me, then prove it!"


But the more she turned it over in her mind,the more she convinced herself-Grace must be bluffing. If there were real evidence, Grace wouldn't waste time with threats. She'd have already exposed her to Johnny. Clearly, this was just a psychological play-a classic move to spook her into making a mistake.She'd never let herself be caught that easily.


"Fine then, bring out your evidence. I doubt it would matter-Johnny would take my word over yours any day," Beatrice retorted, her earlier nerves fading,arrogance taking root again.


Watching Grace keep her composure only fueled Beatrice's sense of triumph. Her smirk grew wider,convinced she'd seen right through the game.


With her usual hawk-likeattention, Grace noticed Johnny striding across the lawn, heading straight for them.



Talk about timing-he couldn't have shown up at a better moment.  Beatrice had been itching for an excuse to put Grace in her place for ages.


"If you'd just stayed out of things, Grace, I wouldn't have wasted a second on a nobody like you. You're just a stray with no real family. Honestly, you don't even belong in my world! But since you decided to poke the bear... well, whatever happens next is on you."


In a flash, she lifted her hands and delivered two dramatic, echoing slaps to her own cheeks.


Grace stared, taken aback.


Was this the latest twist-threats giving way to a solo slap show?


A voice cut through her thoughts, and everything clicked into place.


"Beatrice? What are you doing out here?" Johnny's voice rang out, worry laced through every syllable.


The moment he'd heard Beatrice wasn't feeling well,he'd made a beeline for the infirmary, only to spot her here by a bench and come rushing over.


But as he drew closer and caught sight of her reddened cheeks, he stopped in his tracks."Beatrice...what happened to your face?"


Instantly, Beatrice's eyes filled with tears, her voice trembling with expertly practiced distress. "Johnny...thank goodness you're here. I don't know what I did wrong-your sister just attacked me for no reason...I only wanted to talk, that's all."


"Grace did this to you?!" Disbelief clouded Johnny's face, his features hardening as he tried to process the accusation.



With a trembling voice, Beatrice continued, "| just thought... since she's your family, I should try to make peace. But she... she wouldn't even let me finish a sentence-"


Her words faded away, but the insinuation lingered heavily in the air.

 
"Grace, have you completely lost it? Who hits  someone out of nowhere like that?" Johnny's voice rang out in sharp accusation.


A sliver of doubt gnawed at the back of his mind-random violence didn't sound like Grace at all.


But loyalty had a funny way of clouding judgment,and with Beatrice looking so pitiful, heknew which side he'd take.



Before Grace could get a word in, she calmly lifted her arm and, with practiced ease, landed two stinging slaps right across Beatrice's cheeks.


The faint marks from earlier instantly flared into angry red welts, hot and throbbing.


Shocked into stillness, Beatrice could do nothing but gape, her face burning and swelling beneath the sudden blows.


Grace wasn't built like the average girl. Even holding back, her strikes left a memory Beatrice would feel for days.


"I didn't lay a finger on her before. But since she's so determined to pin the blame on me-and I can't prove otherwise-l figure I might as well live up to her story." A casual shrug accompanied Grace's words.She'd never tolerated being falsely accused. Rather than waste breath arguing, she'd rather make the accusation a fact and end the farce right then and there.


Beatrice pressed a trembling hand to her cheek,staring in disbelief. "Did you really just hit me?I can't believe you actually went through with it!"


Grace tilted her head, her voice dripping with mock cheer. "Weren't you just claiming I struck you for no reason? Now I'm only doing what I'm told. You ought to be grateful, honestly."


Usually, Grace kept to herself, but in that moment,she wielded her words like a blade, tearing into Beatrice without hesitation.


Johnny could only gape, frozen on the spot. Several seconds ticked by before Beatrice let out a pitiful whimper, tears beginning to spill, which finally snapped him out of his daze. He stepped forward, outrage coloring his tone."Grace, have you lost your mind? Why would you go after her like that? What did she ever do to deserve this?"



Grace offered a dismissive shrug. "I've already explained it. She hit herself, then tried to pin it on me.I just figured I might as well play along and give her something real to cry about."


Locking eyes with him, she watched his reaction.Her gaze held steady, cold and unblinking, as though daring him to challenge her version of the story.


He had been preparing a tirade, but when faced with that unflinching stare, the words dried up before they could leave his mouth.



A heavy silence lingered. He could do nothing but stare.



Grace's voice turned airy, almost indifferent."Whether you believe me or not, that's your call."With that, she spun on her heel and strode off,unaffected. The bell rang, signaling the end of class, and now a small crowd of students drifted past, pausing to watch the spectacle with wide-eyed curiosity.
###Chapter 91 Enemy Of Her Enemy





The ruckus quickly drew the attention of several students passing by.


Grace, Beatrice, and Johnny were all well-known figures at school, often the center of attention.


With the three of them now in a confrontation, it instantly became the subject of gossip, with students whispering and speculating about what was going on.


"|I swear I didn't slander her, Johnny. Don't you trust me?" Beatrice cried, tears streaming down her face,unfazed by the growing audience.


She had always been in the limelight and thrived on attention. Being ignored was far more unsettling for her.



What she hadn't anticipated was that Grace wouldn't follow the usual script. Beatrice had already delivered two slaps to herself, only to receive two more from Grace.



Talk about a streak of bad luck!


What made her blood boil even more was the fact that Johnny didn't slap Grace back, nor did he call her out in front of everyone.


"Don't cry. I believe you," Johnny said, trying to juggle his own frustration and confusion while attempting to soothe Beatrice. "There are too many eyes on us right now. Let's talk somewhere else."


With that, he gently took her hand and led her away.


Seeing that the main characters had left, the crowd of gossiping students quickly lost interest and began to scatter.


Only Gianna, who had been lurking quietly in a corner, and Lizzie, her ever-devoted sidekick,remained, unable to contain their buzz of excitement.


"Looks like Grace is making enemies left and right.Even Beatrice can't stand her," Lizzie commented with a smirk.

By now, nearly everyone in their grade knew that Beatrice's confident strut around campus was all thanks to Johnny's support.


Without his backing, considering her family background, she would probably still be on the same level as Grace, who came from an orphanage.


This thought stirred resentment and envy in Lizzie.She couldn't understand what Johnny saw in Beatrice. She was also attractive and came from a far more prestigious family, so why hadn't he ever noticed her?



"Well,this actually works in our favor. Like they say,the enemy of my enemy is my friend," Gianna said,clearly pleased by the situation.



"What are you getting at?" Lizzie asked, curious.


"I'm saying we are going to make a new friend,"Gianna replied.







In a quiet, deserted hallway, Johnny was gently trying to soothe Beatrice. "Don't cry, Beatrice. I know you have been wronged."


He softly pressed an ice pack to her cheek while speaking in a soothing tone. "When I get home tonight, I'll make sure she pays for this. I'll ask my mom to cut off her allowance."



"Really? But isn't your mom super fond of her?"Beatrice asked, still doubtful.


"No matter how much my mom likes her, she is still adopted. Do you think she means more than me, her own son?" Johnny said with smug confidence."I'll have my mom transfer all of Grace's allowance to me. She is only attending this school because my dad donated a lab building. Now that she is stirring up trouble, my mom will teach her a lesson. Our family is all about discipline over spoiling." Once I get the money, I'll buy you those new designer shoes.And didn't you say you have been eyeing those international-brand skincare products? I'll buy them for you!"


 
Johnny understood that Beatrice wasn't difficult to please. She loved shopping and being spoiled with gifts, so he figured he would just have to tighten his budget a bit to keep her happy.


Beatrice's eyes lit up at first, but she quickly composed herself and shook her head. "I don't want that. You have already gotten me so many things lately. It's more than enough."


"As long as you're happy, I can handle it," Johnny said sincerely.


"No, seriously. Just spending time with you, eating together, studying, and going shopping once in a while is all I need," Beatrice replied.


"Every girl enjoys shopping. I can't let you feel less special than anyone else," Johnny said instinctively.Deep down, he sensed that if he didn't treat her with gifts, he would have to work harder to keep her content.


Though he was still green and hadn't given it much thought, he assumed all girls were probably like that.


"Alright then... Thank you, Johnny. You're the best person in the world to me." Beatrice finally managed to smile through her tears.


Even though she hadn't managed to see Grace get punished on the spot, being pampered wvith luxury gifts from Johnny made for a satisfying consolation prize.


After finally calming her down, Johnny hurried off,called away by a teacher who needed him for something.


The moment he disappeared from view, Beatrice dropped her act. She lazily scrolled through her phone, replying to a few messages from admirers and tossing in a bit of harmless flirting before rising slowly and making her way back toward class.


But the second she rounded the corner, she came face-to-face with someone unexpected.


"Hi," Gianna greeted her first, her tone unusually.friendly.


Beatrice blinked, caught off guard. Gianna had always carried herself with an air of superiority and had never bothered to speak to her directly. What was she doing here now, initiating a conversation?


"Did you come looking for me?" Beatrice immediately suspected that this wasn't a random encounter.


"Yes, I wanted to talk to you about something,"Gianna replied smoothly.


"Is this about Grace?" Beatrice wasn't naive. In fact,she was quite sharp, and she immediately saw through Gianna's purpose.



Both Beatrice and Gianna were attractive and well-known at school. While Beatrice didn't quite measure up to Gianna in terms of status, the two had mostly kept their distance from one another.



But ever since Grace had transferred in, she had managed to steal their spotlight without even trying.


Beatrice was convinced Gianna resented Grace just as much as she did.



"You're right. I enjoy working with smart people,"Gianna said, nodding with a hint of approval."Then what do you want? Beatrice asked, arching an eyebrow.


"It's simple; I'm suggesting we work together. From this moment on, we could be friends," Gianna replied.
###Chapter 92 Julia Played Favorites
Long ago, Gianna never gave a second thought to anyone she deemed unworthy of her attention,always careful to guard her image and standing.


"That changed as Grace gradually stole her spotlight. She became eager to find an ally who also hated Grace.



These days, it seemed Grace had made it her mission to stir up trouble between Beatrice and Johnny, causing Beatrice's dislike for her to grow sharper with each passing day. Gianna believed the prospect of joining forces felt too good for Beatrice to pass up.


For Beatrice, it hardly mattered if the friendship with Gianna was shallow, as long as there was something in it for her.



Eventually, both girls found common ground and decided to work together.
 Plans were set: Gianna would grant Beatrice access to the Holden estate, opening doors to high society.In return, Beatrice would spread whispers and turn the tide against Grace.


Once the deal was sealed, each moved on as if nothing had happened.







Adrianna caught up with Grace, worry written on her face. "Grace, they're saying Beatrice's at it again,dragging your name through the mud. Is it true?"Not long before, she had overheard a pack of girls in the hallway, their conversation circling around Grace,Johnny,and Beatrice.


Rumors were swirling that Grace had a strained relationship with Johnny and was jealous of Beatrice.Some students even accused Grace of being insatiable.



Chloe,Beatrice's loyal companion, played ringleader,always ready with a fresh rumor to damage Grace's name. Unable to bite her tongue, Adrianna had confronted Chloe then and there, and their spat nded any hope of friendship.


Unfazed, Grace waved it off. "Let them gossip.I know what I'm doing, and I'll come out just fine."


Experience had taught her how to keep the upper hand. Laying out her strategies in silence, she preferred to wait until everything reached a boiling point before making her move.


Adrianna breathed easier. "That's a relief to hear,"she said with a soft smile.



A new kind of confidence had taken root in her.Grace had become someone she looked up to,pushing away her old insecurities and choosing, at last, to carve out her own happiness.


Grace shot her a look of warning. "You'd better stay alert. Chloe's got it out for you now, and she doesn't let things go easily."


Adrianna nodded with conviction. "I'll look after myself," she replied, genuinely uplifted by Grace's caring words. Her admiration for Grace only deepened in that moment.

  For now, Grace had other things on her mind. Her thoughts wandered to Johnny, wondering if he'd let his temper get the best of him once he got home.


It wasn't Johnny she feared-it was the possibility of upsetting Julia that truly bothered her.


After Grace's last car incident, Julia insisted on being the one to fetch Grace from school. Whenever she couldn't make it, the family's driver filled in.


That afternoon, Grace stepped through the doorway greeted not by silence but by Johnny's raised voice echoing through the house. "Mom, you have to stop handing Grace so much pocket money. And quit buying her all those clothes and gifts. She's getting all the wrong ideas from school!"


Frustration flared in Julia's eyes. "You loudmouth,that's enough! Compared to you and your reckless spending, Grace is a breath of fresh air. If anyone's losing credit card privileges, it ought to be you!"


Earlier, Johnny had strutted around, making promises to Beatrice that he'd persuade his parents to pull the plug on Grace's spending money. Now, fate had flipped the script. Instead of cracking down on Grace, his mom had set her sights on his own allowance. How ironic-it was as if he'd dug his own grave.


Trying to defend himself, he blurted out, "Why are you coming after me, Mom? I've barely spent a thing lately! Grace is the one setting up shop at school,selling things she shouldn't. What if she gets in trouble? Our family could be implicated!" His rant echoed through the hall just as Grace appeared,catching every word.


Realizing he'd been caught bad-mouthing her, his face turned red for a brief second, but pride wouldn't let him back down. He lifted his head and squared his shoulders, telling himself he was only speaking the facts.



Julia, spotting Grace at the door, quickly abandoned her frustration with Johnny. "There you are, darling.I've been waiting for you to come home so we can eat together. Wash up and join us at the table," she said,her tone softening instantly for her daughter. 
 Fearing Grace might take offense, Julia leaned in,her voice gentle. "Don't pay any mind to what Johnny said. He doesn't mean any of it. Deep down, he cares about you; he's just shy, really."


A look of confusion crossed Grace's face. Shy? Since when had Johnny ever acted shy?


With an exaggerated sigh, Johnny said, "Mom, you're so unfair. Am I actually your son? Honestly, I'd prefer not to have this sister!"



Julia only smiled, turning to Grace. "See what he does? Every time he opens his mouth, he says the exact opposite of what he feels. He loves having you around, but he's terrified you'll dislike him."


Johnny groaned, frustration building. How was he supposed to defend himself when his mother twisted everything he said? If anyone was being misunderstood,it was him.


Watching this unfold, Grace felt a twinge of guilt, as if she'd stolen some of Julia's love away from Johnny.

Julia had lost her patience. "Johnny, move out of the way. If you keep running your mouth, you can just stay at school instead of coming home," she snapped, her irritation clear. It was no secret-daughters were easier to love. Johnny just kept causing headaches.


All the swagger he had shown in front of Beatrice evaporated. It was obvious now-his mother played favorites. Maybe he wasn't even her real child;maybe he really had been picked up off the street.


Julia turned her attention to her daughter. "Grace,let's see you top your old record. Why not have more than one plate tonight?"


Rodger chimed in, encouraging her, "She's right Grace. You're still growing. Eat plenty so you'll be tall and strong."



Every meal now became a showcase of affection,with both Julia and Rodger doting on Grace, urging her to eat more-sometimes even playfully challenging her appetite. Wanting to please them, Grace managed a plate and a half, though she felt stuffed to the brim by the end.


Meanwhile, Johnny sat at the table, ignored and invisible, whether he finished his food or left it untouched

###Chapter 93 Talking To Johnny
Any sign of enthusiasm vanished from Johnny's face,leaving him looking completely defeated.


Clear favoritism was on display, no question about it.Even his own dad had switched sides, falling into the ranks of those parents who only had eyes for their daughters.



Years ago, arriving home meant his dad would greet him with questions about his day at school. These days, every conversation seemed to orbit around Grace and her latest achievements.



What was the big deal about having a daughter,anyway? Why was she suddenly the center of the universe?



One thing he knew for sure-if he ever had kids,he would make sure to have a son. Someone who would carry himself with pride and face life head-on.Unbeknownst to him, he would one day have an adorable daughter and would shower her with all the love he could give.



The evening meal offered him at least one consolation. His mother hadIn't forgotten about him;she appeared at his door with a glass of milk as well.


Spotting the identical "mother-daughter" mugs in their hands, disappointment hit him all over again.Those mugs were rare, the sort of thing you could search for endlessly and never find, even with a fortune to spend.


And yet, his own drink came in a flimsy plastic cup,the type handed out for free when you bought groceries. Overlooked once more, Johnny fought back tears he was too proud to let fall.


He stormed into his room, slammed the door,and nursed his frustration. He made a silent vow to outshine everyone-he would ace his classes, earn a spot at the top university, and make his parents regret not appreciating him.


Just a few feet away, laughter and warmth floated from Grace's room, as if their closeness could seep through the walls.


"Darling, James spends most of his time at the office these days... and as for Johnny, he sometimes says things the wrong way, but no one could doubt how much he loves you-maybe even more than I do,"said Julia, her words gentle as she reached for something behind her.


A brightly wrapped gift box appeared in her hands as if by magic.


"Take a look at what your brothers picked out for you -it's that special designer collection, the one that's so hard to find. They might not say it out loud, but there's no question how much they care. You must accept it."


Nothing seemed off limits for Julia, who tried every possible approach to ensure Grace felt at home,determined to weave her into the family fabric come what may.


"Sure. Just let them know l'm grateful, okay?"replied Grace, perfectly aware of her mother's intentions and choosing to play her part with effortless grace.

Julia didn't let up. "And... do you get along with them?"



A quick nod followed. "I do. They've both gone out of their way to make me feel welcome. I've never once felt left out."



With a teasing glint, Julia took it a step further. "So tell me-who holds the top spot in your heart? Me,your brothers, or your dad?"


Grace stopped for a moment, wondering if her mom was actually fishing for affection.


"You, obviously," answered Grace, her answer flowing out smooth and genuine, but with just the right touch of sweetness.


Because when it came down to it, no one matched Julia's level of care. Her father and brothers were wonderful, of course, but the bond with Julia was on another level.


A modest smile played on Julia's lips, but she was bursting inside, already plotting how she'd haul her husband away for a celebratory drink in their room.

"Mom, I'm going to go find Johnny and talk for a bit before bed. You should get some sleep, too."



"Sure, go ahead! You two should spend more time together. And if you ever get stuck on your assignments, don't forget, your brother is a top ten student in his class," remarked Julia, her encouragement brimming with pride.


"No problem," responded GGrace.



Truth be told, Grace never struggled with school-every test came easy to her, so tutoring was hardly on her mind.


Still, she did have something important to bring up with Johnny tonight.


After Julia departed, her mood light and cheerful,Grace rose from her chair and slipped out into the hallway. She stopped at the next door and gave it a polite knock.



"Who is it? Come in."



Recognizing Johnny's voice, Grace pushed the door open and stepped inside.


Never before had she set foot in his room.



Compared to hers, Johnny's space felt dimmer and much smaller. The decor and layout-there really was no contest. No denying it-the contrast stood out.


"What brings you here?" asked Johnny, caught off guard by her appearance. Expecting their mom,he hadn't bothered checking.


Now he was left wondering what Grace wanted.


"Relax, Johnny," replied Grace, letting out a gentle sigh. "It's not like I'm here to start trouble."


"Who's calling me tense? What are you doing here,anyway? Don't telI me you've shown up for payback or something," said Johnny, instantly stiffening as if expecting trouble.


A quiet sigh escaped Grace as she rubbed at her temples, choosing not to circle around the issue."Are you still upset with me?"


A gentle tone colored her words, and her eyes glimmered with such innocence that she looked like a helpless fawn.


Seriously-was she really trying to win sympathy with that act?


"I am still upset. What of it?" Johnny declared,folding his arms and scowling. "And you can save those sad eyes for someone else.I'm not falling for it."



Grace spoke softly. "I know you clashed with Mom earlier... and that Dad put a freeze on your allowance."



Johnny's routine lately had been a mess-nights out,sometimes not even coming home until morning.That behavior was what got his card privileges revoked in the first place.


Call it karma, because consequences landed quickly.


Earlier that day, he had even strutted around bragging to Beatrice about how he'd make sure their parents shut off Grace's spending. And how did that turn out?
 Their household had always played by the same rule -sons get tough love, daughters get pampered.


Grace ended up with a black card and no limits.Johnny? Stuck with a pitiful debit card and a $5, 000monthly ceiling. He couldn't help but think it was sad.


Back before Grace arrived, the question of fairness never even crossed his mind. He would scrape together any birthday money, holiday bonuses, and every bit of loose change, just to surprise Beatrice with little gifts.


Now, his dad even put a freeze on his allowance.


"Did you come in here just to gloat? Is this your victory lap? Listen-"


Before Johnny could even finish his complaint, Grace extended a bank card in his direction, her gesture calm and unhurried.


###Chapter 94 Grace's Plan

"What do you mean by this?" Johnny asked, his brows furrowed in confusion.



Grace truly was an odd one. He had been in the middle of sharply rebuking her, laying bare his frustration and disappointment, when she suddenly extended a bank card toward him. What exactly was she trying to say with this gesture?


"I know you're upset about what happened today,and I do regret losing my temper and hitting Beatrice," Grace said softly. "This is my personal bank card. I know Dad suspended yours, so I'm giving you mine."


It was the first time Grace had ever been so compliant-so unusually eager to make amends.


Of course, she didn't actually regret slapping that two-faced Beatrice. If anything, she'd do it again without blinking. But there was no reason Johnny

needed to know that.



"You're giving this to me? Are you serious?" Johnny asked, still eyeing her with skepticism.


"Yes. I'm serious."


"You're not worried I'll max it out?" he pressed. The card was nothing special-just a regular debit card,certainly not the sleek black one their mother had once handed her, the kind that came with no spending limit but didn't allow cash withdrawals.


This one probably held whatever meager savings Grace had managed to squirrel away through her frugal habits. Honestly, it might not even be enough to buy Beatrice a full skincare set before it hit zero.


"No," Grace said evenly. In truth, it would take a lot more effort than he realized to drain her account.



Johnny paused, battling with himself in silence.


Eventually, he drew himself up, adopting a tone he imagined sounded firm and effortlessly cool. "Alright then, since you're insisting, I'll accept it. But you better not lay a hand on Beatrice again, understand?"


"Understood," Grace replied.



"And stop being so cold and withdrawn," he continued, gaining steam. "When you see me,say hi and smile. Focus on your grades instead of selling those shady, unapproved products at school. It reflects badly on the family. Got it?"



"Got it."



Johnny blinked, taken aback by how easily she agreed. The long, stern lecture he'd rehearsed in his head suddenly felt unnecessary. He cleared his throat. "Okay, you can go now."


Grace turned to leave. She had barely taken two steps when Johnny called after her, "Wait-I don't know the PIN!"



"I'll text it to you," she replied sweetly, flashing a soft smile over her shoulder.



That wide-eyed, innocent look made Johnny waver.For a split second, he wondered if he'd been too harsh.



But he quickly shook off the guilt trying to creep in and waved her away. "Never mind, just go."


He couldn't afford to go soft. Tomorrow, he was going to use that card to get Beatrice something nice.



"Alright," Grace said with a nod and left the room.


As the door clicked shut behind her, a small,triumphant smile curled on her lips.


She'd played Johnny like a fiddle.


No, she hadn't apologized properly. And no, she hadn't comforted him either. But it was all for his own good.


She knew without a doubt that he would end up using the bank card to buy luxury gifts for Beatrice.


During her time in the Holden household, she had kept her distance on the surface-but in truth, she had been carefully studying each family member's personality. She had figured out early on that Rodger and Julia genuinely cared about her. James, for all his soft-spoken charm, was emotionally detached. And Johnny? He was hopelessly blinded by love. He never spent on himself, always savng his allowance to splurge on Beatrice.


So when Beatrice's flings with other men eventually surfaced one day-as Grace knew they would-Johnny wouldn't even try to take back the gifts he'd showered on her.



But now, things had changed. From this moment forward, every shilling Johnny spent on Beatrice would be Grace's money. Each transaction would be clearly documented.


And when the breakup finally came, Grace would make sure Beatrice returned everything she had taken.



Grace wasn't the type to let things slide. Anyone who.dared to mock or challenge her would eventually face the consequences.


When the time was right, she would repay them-not equally, but double.






The next day.


Within just a few hours, Grace's phone had been buzzing nonstop with bank alerts-each one for a modest transaction.



Annoyed by the constant interruptions, she eventually switched her phone to silent.



She hadn't expected Johnny to be this restrained.For someone born into privilege, he was surprisingly tight-fisted.


Maybe he was still testing the waters, trying to confirm if her card truly had enough funds for him to spend freely. Or maybe he hadn't started shopping for Beatrice yet and was just easing into it.


But that was fine. Grace was certain it was only a matter of time before he began using her card to spoil Beatrice with expensive gifts.


Once Beatrice started receiving them regularly, her greed would only grow. She would begin to expect more-demand more-never satisfied with what she had.


If, by then, Johnny managed to open his eyes and cut ties with that vain, materialistic woman, it would be a relief.



If not, he would be the one left broken.



Because he was no match for someone as manipulative and cunning as Beatrice.
  ###Chapter 95 Visiting Ethel
It was the weekend, a rare day off.


Grace, who had always been an early riser thanks to her strict internal clock, had gradually been spoiled by Julia-gently coaxed into the habit of sleeping in.



In her previous foster home, she was dragged ou of bed by seven sharp every morning, expected to cook breakfast and run errands like an unpaid maid.


But here, at the Holden household? She once got up at seven, strolled around the house, and didn't see a single person awake. She figured she might as well go for a jog, only to run into Julia-who had happened to rise early-and Rodger, already dressed for work. That was the day the couple discovered Grace didn't sleep in, even on weekends.



Julia had been appalled. Without hesitation, she swept Grace back to her room, motherly affection written all over her face as she said, "Grace, this is the Holden family, not one of those dreadful places you used to live. You should sleep in until the sun is high in the sky. That's perfectly normal here. You're still growing, and getting more sleep is good for you.We don't have a habit of getting up early on rest days."


Just as she finished, Johnny came downstairs and objected, "Mom, how can you say that? You always told James and me that we should build good habits by going to bed early and getting up early!"


Julia looked momentarily embarrassed, but Rodger quickly jumped in to support her. "Johnny, you must have misheard. Go back to bed and get more sleep-you're still growing too."


Seriously? At this hour, they usually dragged him outside for morning exercises. And now? The rules had changed just like that. Johnny grumbled all the way back upstairs, but he was secretly thankful for.Grace's influence-it meant a rare lazy morning for him,too.


All in all, it was Julia and Rodger's doting nature that had slowly encouraged Grace to adopt this new routine.


But today, she didn't have the luxury ofsleeping in.She had to get up early to visit Ethel with Julia.


She'd heard about it the day before. Apparently,Ethel's health was declining, and she wanted her family close.


Eliana, who had recently undergone major surgery,was also staying at Ethel's residence to recover.


It felt like the perfect time for Grace to check on Eliana's condition.



Rodger had an important meeting at the company and couldn't go with them.


Johnny had already made plans to play basketball with his classmates. And James, being the future successor of the Holden Group, had to tag along with Rodger for hands-on experience at the company.


That left Grace to accompany Julia alone.


"See? Nothing beats having a daughter!" Julia sighed warmly. "Those boys are always off dloing their own thing. But having a sweet daughter by my side, now that's real comfort."



The driver dropped them off at Ethel's residence.The old lady was basking in the morning sun out in the garden, munching on snacks and looking perfectly content.


She was surrounded by people, like a queen flanked by her loyal attendants.



Among them were familiar faces-Gianna, Claire,and Eliana.



Grace was taken aback when she saw Beatrice. Why had she come here? Grace recognized the issue as soon as she saw Beatrice sitting near Gianna.



"Julia, Grace, you're here! Come join us; we're enjoying some desserts," Eliana called out cheerfully.



It was just past nine in the morning-an ideal hour to indulge in dainty dessers and elegant pastries while basking in leisure.
Since Grace had saved Eliana's life, the latter no longer looked at her with disdain. Instead, she greeted Grace with warm enthusiasm, fully aware that her continued health-and perhaps survival-depended on Grace.


No matter how wealthy or influential one might be,aging and illness were inevitable. With someone like Grace in the family, Eliana had learned to adjust her attitude.



However,.not everyone saw it that way. Some still questioned whether Grace had truly saved Eliana,convinced she was merely basking in Kevin's reflected glory.


"Grace, you're just in time. I've heard from Gianna and Beatrice that you've been neglecting your studies and started a business?" Ethel spoke up, her tone sharp and disapproving. Every time she saw Grace,a headache seemed to follow. Without a blood connection, it was difficult for her to feel any genuine affection.



Even though Eliana swore by Grace's role in her recovery, Ethel still refused to believe it. How could a girl under twenty lead a high-risk surgery that lasted over ten hours? It sounded absurd.


Moments earlier, Gianna had whispered that Grace wasn't focused on school anymore and had begun selling skincare products. The notion disgusted Ethel. Was the Holden family so poor that Grace had to resort to such petty sales? It felt like a stain on their reputation.


Even if Grace was trying to win their approval, Ethel was far from impressed.


"Yes, you could say that. They really wanted it,sol tried to get some for them," Grace replied calmly.These weren't just any products-they were high-end skincare items once reserved for royalty.


"Ridiculous! You're a student-you should be concentrating on your studies. What exactly are you trying to prove?" Ethel snapped, her irritation bubbling over. Grace always seemed to get under her skin.


"Ethel, how can you say that about Grace?" Julia most interjected, her usual gentle demeanor shifting as her tone turned firm. "If she has the ability to manage this, it's a good thing-far better than burying herself in books alone."

 ###Chapter 96 Fighting Her Own Battles
"Are you still standing up for her? It's because you've pampered her too much that she's become completely uncontrollable!"


Ethel's face darkened, frustration igniting her heart condition once more.



In her view, Grace's defiant streak was obvious. At this rate, with how much they were indulging her, it was only a matter of time before something truly disastrous happened.



Then again, she thought Rodger never should have married Julia, who always got on her nerves.


From the sidelines, Beatrice watched with satisfaction gleaming in her eyes. Seeing Grace being put in her place was the kind of scene she relished. Her resentment toward Julia ran deep-if the Holdens had adopted her instead of that nobody,she would've outshined Grace a thousand times over. "Mom, don't say that. I actually think Grace is wonderful. Everyone shines in their own way," Eliana said brightly, her voice full of warmth as she openly took Grace's side.



Realizing Eliana had been completely won over by Grace made Gianna feel sick. But for now, she couldn't find an angle to stir up more trouble.


"Grandma, don't get too worked up. You haven't been feeling well lately. Try to focus on resting and keeping your spirits up," Gianna said sweetly.She knew exactly how to keep Ethel on her side.


Beatrice wasn't about to miss the moment either.Despite still being a student, she was a natural at social manipulation.


With a graceful smile, she offered, "Mrs. Holden, I heard from Gianna that you've been having aches and pains lately. I know a little about massage-would you like me to help ease the tension?"


"That would be lovely. You're such a considerate girl," Ethel replied, her tone softening at once. If Gianna had brought her along, then surely this girl had been raised well.


Beatrice stepped forward eagerly, her hands already in motion as she began to massage Ethel's shoulders. She carried herself with the poise of someone polished and attentive.


The men she had once entertained always raved about her massages-she'd even taken professional lessons to perfect the technique. And now, alI that training was finally proving useful.


"Mmm... Not bad at all. You've got just the right pressure, and you know exactly where to press. I'm impressed," Ethel murmured, clearly enjoying the massage.


"Exactly," Gianna jumped in smoothly, seizing the opportunity to take another dig. "Massages, at worst,are harmless-unlike some people who insist on acting like doctors, performing surgeries, and recklessly selling meds. That's when things start getting dangerous."


Everyone present picked up on the veiled insult without needing names. Julia's face immediately turned grim.


"Of course, medicine isn't something to take lightly.Eliana, your brother should help you find a proper specialist for a second opinion," Ethel added sternly,her voice lined with distrust toward anyone outside the realm of officially recognized doctors-especially Grace.



"Mom, I only trust Grace. She understands my condition better than anyone. She's the only one I'll allow to treat me," Eliana declared, her tone firm and final.


This wasn't just about liking Grace. Eliana genuinely believed in her ability. And deep down, she remained deeply grateful.


Julia had been ready to speak up in Grace's defense,but before she could open her mouth, someone else jumped in.


"Mrs. Holden and Gianna do make a good point.Grace grew up in an orphanage-how much real education could she have possibly received? There's no way she understands advanced medical science."
It was Beatrice. Buoyed by the recent compliments from Ethel, she couldn't resist the urge to chime in.Spotting Ethel's clear dislike for Grace, she eagerly took the opportunity to lecture Grace.


Julia had never cared much for the girl to begin with.And now, hearing her openly demean Grace pushed her patience to the brink.



She was about to strike out when Grace gently pulled at her sleeve, telling her to wait. Grace then gently raised her voice. "Beatrice, I doubt your own family background is anything to boast about." Her tone was light, lips curved in a half-smile, but the steel in her voice was impossible to miss. "A gambling father,a sickly mother, and a little brother still in primary school... If we're laying everything bare, your situation's hardly an upgrade. You're only here thanks to my dear brother's generosity-he's been paying your tuition and living costs."



There was a quiet satisfaction in standing her ground. That was why Grace had stopped Julia-she preferred to fight her own battles.
Her words landed with force. Beatrice's face turned crimson, her eyes darting as she scrambled for a response but found none.


Ethel, who had been watching from the sidelines,suddenly took a second look. Just moments ago,she had found Beatrice charming-elegant, well-groomed, decked out in luxury brands. She had assumed the girl came from a respectable,well-off family. But now? A troubled background? A charity case funded by her grandson? Ethel's eyes grew cold, tainted with the same contempt she felt for people lower in society. There was no doubt that people in her society were categorized into ranks.


"Wait... Johnny's been paying her bills?" Julia's eyes widened, disbelief flashing across her face.


She had always been strict with her son, tightly managing his allowance-nothing like the leniency she extended to Grace.



And yet, even with so little at his disposal, he had still managed to support Beatrice? That could only mean one thing-he'd been saving and sacrificing just for her.


A heavy feeling settled in Julia's chest. Was her son truly growing attached to this girl? She didn't likethat thought one bit!

###Chapter 97 Using Beatrice's Very Own Trick Against Her
"That's not the case at all. Johnny never paid my way. Scholarships and working part-time kept me afloat. My parents are not destitute, either. It's not like people are saying," said Beatrice, her tone firm but steady.


Never in a million years would she confess to scheming for money from her sugar daddies,or that her family leaned on her to make ends meet. And letting the Holden family see her as some desperate girl chasing after a rich heir was out of the question.


"Full scholarships don't just fall from the sky," replied Grace, not missing a beat. "Unless you rank in the top three, it's nearly impossible. If memory serves,you never even cracked the top ten." Grace wasn't about to let her off the hook and ruthlessly refuted her claim.
 Stepping in as Beatrice's champion, Gianna spoke with confidence. "Grace, you're still new here.Beatrice used to be one of the top three students.She's always worked hard, and her parents have respectable jobs."


Experience told Gianna that neither Ethel nor Julia would bother checking the details, so she helped uphold the lie and keep things calm.


Besides, she didn't see any harm in Johnny and Beatrice being tangled up together.


A part of her hoped Johnny wouldn't find someone with brighter prospects-he had never paid her special attention, no matter how she tried.


On top of that, he had a knack for speaking harshly to her, and the thought of him living happily grated on her nerves.



With Gianna's intervention, Ethel accepted the explanation and decided it wasn't worth probing further.


Across the room, the butler entered with a steaming pot of coffee. Hoping to make a good impression on Ethel, Beatrice hurried forward and offered to pour her a cup.


Stories about Ethel's enduring grip on the Holden Group had made their way to Beatrice, courtesy of Gianna. Even after stepping away from the business due to her health, Ethel's word still carried weight throughout the company.


"Mrs. Holden, Gianna mentioned how much you appreciate a cup of hot coffee. Please, let me serve you a fresh one," remarked Beatrice, her hands busy with the coffee set. She couldn't help but notice Grace standing quietly at her side.


A sly idea took root in Beatrice's mind almost immediately.


The plan changed the instant her fingers wrapped around the cup. Instead of passing it to Ethel, she plotted to let the scalding liquidspill onto her own skin, making sure it happened away from prying eyes.



Her intention was to act the victim and point the  finger at Grace.


Unfortunately for her, Grace had been paying close attention, always ready for any schemes Beatrice might cook up.


Not a single move slipped past her watchful eyes.


Just as Beatrice moved to set her plan in motion,Grace deftly intercepted the cup and, where no one else was watching, deliberately tipped the hot coffee onto her own hand.



A sharp cry escaped her lips. "Ow, that's burning hot!" exclaimed Grace, her eyes brimming with tears she fought to hold back, then with trembling accusation, she turned to Beatrice."Why would you do that to me, Beatrice? I simply mentioned your background? Why the hostility?"



Grace had never struggled with a performance-making accusations was practically second nature,and she played the part flawlessly.



Right as her final word left her lips, everyone in the room shifted their focus to her, and at that perfect moment, tears spilled down her cheeks.


"Oh no, Grace, what happened? Are you hurt?!"Julia's voice rang out in alarm. The sight of Grace's red,scalded hand, along with her sorrowful tears, left her heart aching with worry.


Grace had always been her pride-a gentle,thoughtful child who almost never let her feelings spill over, let alone cry. Watching her daughter now,full of pain and brimming with injustice, left Julia's calm heart twisting in anguish.


"What were you thinking? Grace barely rebuked you,and yet you went so far as to pour hot coffee on her?At your age, to harbor such spite shows something is deeply wrong."


The scheme unraveling before her eyes left Beatrice speechless. Never had she expected Grace to flip the script and use her very own trick against her.


Helplessness settled in, and she could hardly stand it. "That's not true. I swear I didn't do it! She poured it on herself!" she explained, desperation leaking into every word.
The possibility of Julia becoming her mother-in-law one day was never far from Beatrice's mind. No matter her frustrations, she couldn't afford to antagonize Julia.


"Grace isn't unreasonable. There's no way she'd burn herself on purpose," retorted Julia, her tone cold and final. "You've hurt my daughter and now you're lying about it. Please leave."


For the first time, Julia's protective side surfaced so fiercely that she ordered a guest out without hesitation.


Quickly, she called the butler to fetch the first-aid kit and leaned over Grace, her words full of concern."Does it sting badly?"


"Really, Mom, there's no need to worry. It doesn't hurt much at all. I have burn ointment in my room, so I'll be back to normal soon." Grace hoped to put her mother at ease.



Worrying her mom wasn't on the agenda. She'd made sure before acting that the coffee was only comfortably warm-not hot enough to leave any marks.



Beatrice's self-preservation instincts would never allow her to risk real pain. No one knew that better than Grace.



"Maybe this was just an accident. Beatrice could have bumped Grace by mistake, and the coffee went flying. Aunt Julia, try not to be too upset," Gianna interjected, although her patience with Beatrice's blunders was wearing thin, especially since they shared the same precarious position.
 
###Chapter 98 Ethel Fainted

Life in Beatrice's household was a constant struggle;money slipped through their fingers and trouble wNas never far behind.


Still, her striking looks and talent for reinventing herself ensured that no one ever looked down upon her.



To be told to get out of someone's house was an insult she could hardly process.


Finding Julia so unyielding-willing to kick her out over an adopted child-struck Beatrice as both outrageous and deeplyembarrassing. The thought of leaving in disgrace, only for Grace to broadcast her downfall at school, sent a chill down her spine.


Determined not to go quietly, she clung to the hope that Gianna's voice might sway Julia's decision.


On the other side, Julia paid no heed to Gianna's pleas. Her patience with Gianna had thinned,and her resolve hardened. No matter what, she would not forgive the girl who had hurt her daughter.


"How could all of this be a simple accident..." Julia started.


Suddenly, Ethel-already frail these days-was overcome by the rising tension in the room and collapsed before anyone could react.


Panic shot through the gathering. "Mom, what's happening? Why did you pass out so suddenly?"


"Grandma, please wake up! Don't scare us like this!"shouted Gianna, rushing to her side.


Chaos swept through the halls.


Without missing a beat, Eliana dialed both the ambulance service and the family doctor. Gianna and Beatrice instantly dissolved into tears, putting on a synchronized show of worry and confusion.


Claire remained rooted to the spot, utterly lost about how to help.


In the midst of the chaos, Julia urged Grace to tend to Ethel. Gianna stepped in to block her,fully aware that Ethel had no patience for anyone without proper medical credentials-she only placed her trust in professionals. Grace, lacking any formal background,would never be permitted to lay a hand on Ethel.


Gianna's confidence was unshakable: even if Ethel regained consciousness, she would surely take her side.



A stroke of luck placed the family doctor just minutes away. Arriving in record time, he kept Grace at a distance and immediately set to work. "Mrs. Holden's health issues are longstanding. It appears her blood pressure was left unchecked, causing a blockage and this fainting spell. She'll wake up soon. But for her safety, she needs a full examination at the hospital."



Relief washed over the room at the doctor's verdict.Within moments, the family began ushering Ethel out for urgent care.


Each member of the Holden family trailed after her,leaving Beatrice-always on the periphery-to quietly make her exit.



Before slipping away, she took a moment to hiss at Grace, who was walking alone, saying, "Grace, do you see how it is? You'll always be on the outside.Don't get too comfortable. They might toss you aside just as easily."


"Appreciate the heads-up," replied Grace with a light laugh. "Maybe you're rightabout tomorrow, but right now, I have everything I need."


Flashing her sparkling bracelet, she breezed past Beatrice, linking arms with Julia and nestling close in a show of intimacy.


She had long since mastered the art of provoking jealousy in others.


Just as she expected, a quick look over her shoulder revealed Beatrice's cheeks burning with rage. That bitter expression filled her with a dark sort of delight.


Meanwhile,the Holden family gathered quietly in the hospital corridor while Ethel underwent her series of medical tests. Being the primary donors of this elite private hospital ensured Ethel skipped the usual queues and received immediate care.


Not long after, her trusted doctor appeared to share the results. "Mrs. Holden's condition is fairly typical among seniors. It's a cardiovascular issue, but there's no reason to panic. With medication, it should remain under control."



Those words brought visible relief to the anxious family members-after all, such health problems were to be expected in someone of Ethel's age.Consistent medication and check-ups would likely keep things in check.



Out of the blue, Grace spoke up. "That's not the whole story. Her situation is much more critical than you think. Medications and routine visits won't be enough. If nothing changes now, she could suffer a stroke, paralysis, or even a heart attack in less than three months."



Everyone froze, her grave warning sending a collective chill through the room.
Gianna was quick to lash out. "Grace, don't talk nonsense! Grandma will recover just fine. Do you even realize how ominous that sounds?" Tears streaming down her cheeks as she ramped up the drama.



Sophia Holden, Carl's elegantly dressed wife, joined the chorus with a scowl. "Who let this girl in here,cursing Ethel with talk of death? Where's her respect?" Her voice and posture were as fierce as her flashy jewelry.


"Please, don't misunderstand Grace," Julia replied,rushing to shield her. "She's only concerned for Ethel's health and spoke from the heart."


Truly, Grace's background set her apart-raised under the state's watchful eye and shaped by a rigorous elite program, she never really learned the everyday warmth that came from family.


Seeking to bridge that gap, officials arranged for her to live with adoptive parents and discover what home life meant.



Over time, Grace became more open and approachable, though she still had a ways to go before fully fitting in.
###Chapter 99 Sowing Discord
Young lady, you shouldn't speak without understanding the situation. I've been Mrs. Holden's attending doctor for years. Who would know her health better than I do?"


Jacob Blake, the specialist overseeing Ethel's care,didn't bother hiding his irritation. Being questioned by a young girl was clearly beneath him.


"Precisely because you think you know her condition,her health has never truly improved," Grace replied,her voice calm.


"These are age-related issues! Full recovery is impossible. It's already a miracle we've eased her symptoms!" Jacob's frustration boiled over, his tone defensive and indignant.


"It's not that she can't be treated-it's just that her body won't return to what it once was. But stabilizing her condition and relieving her symptoms is achievable," Grace explained patiently, directing her words toward those with little medical background.


Had it not been for her parents, she wouldn't have bothered justifying herself, let alone speaking so gently.


But to Jacob and Gianna, her calm reasoning sounded preposterous, like the ramblings of a dreamer who didn't understand science.


"| believe Grace is right. She saved me when I was gravely ill: I might not be entirely cured, but I can now hope to live another twenty, even thirty years. If she could heal me, then helping Mom should be well within her abilities," Eliana said, her voice filled with quiet conviction.


"Aunt Eliana, it was the Master Healer who saved you. Grace only assisted. She shouldn't claim credit for that. And even if she did help, it's not the same thing. This isn't her field!" Gianna countered quickly,her tone tinged with disbelief.


Eliana's illness had been gastrointestinal-nothing like the cardiovasc ular complications Ethel was dealing with.



Besides, Gianna had never truly believed Grace had taken part in any surgery.



"Enough. There's no need to argue anymore. Mom's condition is stable, so let Dr. Blake continue her treatment. We shouldn't change doctors without good reason," Carl said firmly, his voice carrying the weight of final authority.



With Rodger away on urgent business, Carl's wNord held sway in the family.



Julia, whose husband was absent, chose not to push the issue further. She decided it would be best to let Ethel decide for herself once she regained consciousness.


After all, it was Ethel's health on the line.


Once Grace and Julia left, the others gradually followed. Only Gianna remained, staying behind with a look of devoted concern, deliberately putting on a show as she sat quietly by Ethel's bedside.
The next morning, Ethel slowly opened her eyes. The first face she saw was Gianna, who had been part of her life since childhood.


Seeing Gianna still there, apparently having stayed the entire night, touched her deeply. In that moment,she believed Gianna cared for her more than any of her own children did.



"Grandma, you're finally awake! I was so worried.Thank goodness you're alright," Gianna exclaimed,her voice trembling with emotion. "Grace would've made a terrible mistake if things went her way. Here,drink some water-it'll help your throat."Her reddened eyes conveyed a mix of relief and concern,though her words subtly cast Grace in a negative light.



"What did she do to me?" Ethel asked, alarmed by the implication that something had gone wrong while she was unconscious.



Gianna hesitated, pretending to struggle with the truth before finally speaking. "With her little bit of medical knowledge, she accused Dr. Blake of incompetence. She claimed you'd suffer a stroke,become paralyzed, or even have a heart attack in three months."



"That girl is wicked! Spewing such nonsense!" Ethel burst out, her temper flaring. Her dislike for Grace grew even deeper.


To her, such grim predictions sounded more like curses than concerns.



Watching her plan take root, Gianna felt a quiet wave of satisfaction. Everything was going exactly as she intended.







Meanwhile, Beatrice wasn't ready to give up just yet.She had nearly earned Ethel's approval-until the old woman collapsed.



Knowing that Gianna would never willingly reintroduce her into the family fold, she decided to take matters into her own hands. She would visit Ethel herself and try to win her favor.

With her plan in place, she swiftly prepared a pot of chicken soup and made her way to the hospital room Gianna had mentioned.



The Holden family's wealth was unmistakable-Ethel was receiving specialized care in a spacious, private ward.



Beatrice swallowed her envy, straightened her posture, and knocked politely before stepping inside.



Only Ethel and Gianna were present-the setting was ideal for her to make a favorable impression.


"Mrs. Holden, how are you doing today? I made some chicken soup to help you feel better," Beatrice said,her voice gentle, her expression carefully arranged to seem sincere.



Gianna's irritation flared at the sight of Beatrice's overly sweet demeanor. Ethel, however, was unappreciative as she had forgotten about her.


She was a little contemptuous of Beatrice's lowly origins.

"No need; I have customized meals prepared by nutritionists. However, I'm grateful for the gesture,"Ethel answered.
###Chapter 100 Running Into Colton
Beatrice had been brimming with confidence,silently practicing just how she'd play the role of the thoughtful guest to win Ethel over. Yet when Ethel met her efforts with such chilling disinterest-mixed with a dash of contempt-every ounce of her enthusiasm fizzled out.



Her mind spun in confusion. Only yesterday, her attempt to curry favor with a simple massage had earned her a stream of praise. Was this sudden shift really all aboout her family's status?


Each new thought brought fresh waves of humiliation. Instinctively, she glanced at Gianna,searching for some support.


Gianna,however, couldn't even be bothered to look her way. As far as she was concerned, Beatrice had made a fool of herself yesterday-and now she wanted to challenge her for Ethel's affection? The idea was laughable.
 With practiced sweetness, Gianna addressed her in a voice soft enough for Ethel to hear. "Beatrice, my grandma's just woken up. She's still fragile, and my uncle and aunt are on their way here now. How about you head home for a bit? I'll message you later, al right?"


Beatrice saw right through the sugary act. She knew Gianna had a talent for manipulation, and her reputation for scheming was well-earned.


"I'm leaving then," replied Beatrice, her voice cool and measured, though inside, bitterness twisted tight.


Had she foreseen this outcome, never in a million years would she have risked crossing Julia the day before.


She had barely disappeared down the corridor before Julia and Rodger entered the hospital,trailed by James, Johnny, and-front and center-the family's darling, Grace.


With Ethel's fragile state, there was little surprise in seeing them put on a show of concern, regardless of whether their care was genuine or just for appearances.


Trailing the family into Ethel's room, Grace offered a polite greeting, but the old woman's response was little more than a dismissive glance. If anything, Ethel looked as if she wished Grace would disappear altogether.


No offense was taken on Grace's part. She was only present out of consideration for Julia and Rodger.Affection was a two-way street, and she had long ago learned not to extend kindness where it wasn't wanted.



Refusing to waste another moment on hollow exchanges, Grace slipped quietly out of the room,eager for a breath of fresh air-and a chance to check out the hospital's facilities for herself.


This wasn't just any private hospital, after all. Two of its founding doctors had earned international fame,and both had once been students of hers.


Her steps carried her toward the elevators when she suddenly felt a gentle puIl on her sleeve.

 The grip was soft, almost hesitant.


Turning to see who it was, Grace found herself facing Colton, every bit as striking as she remembered.


"I wasn't expecting you here," Grace remarked, one eyebrow arching in mild surprise. There was a time when seeing him in a hospital would've made perfect sense, but these days his health stats were nearly flawless-he definitely wasn't a patient.


"Just dropping by for an employee who's unwell,"Colton replied with ease. "What brings you here?"



"My grandma's sick. I'm checking up on her," Grace answered, her expression unreadable. All the while,her thoughts whirred-what kind of staff member could prompt Colton himself to pay a visit? Clearly,this person held his deepest trust.


A few more stiff remarks passed between them before both settled into silence. The silence hardly felt awkward-these two had always been comfortable with their own company, never needing words to fill the space. Onlookers might have felt uneasy, but to them, the hush was perfectly natural.
Sensing the lull, Colton broke it with a casual suggestion. "Are you heading out now? How about grabbing a bite together?"


Grace didn't hesitate. "I'll pass. My family's here-I'll be leaving with them."


Normally, rejections didn't faze Colton, but her instant, unbothered refusal struck a chord of irritation he hadn't expected.


A low chuckle escaped him, and his gaze lingered on her for a moment. "No wonder you're everyone's favorite. Always the obedient, well-mannered daughter."


His words had a playful edge, neither warm nor romantic-just teasing, and a little ambiguous.


Grace accepted it with a shrug. That was true enough; in front of her parents, she played the role to perfection.


"Dr. Q," Colton called out again, voice dropping as if sharing a secret, "lately, I can't shake this chill-feels like there's something still off inside. Maybe that old toxin flaring up? How about you come by and check me out? Name your fee."


His sharp gaze searched her bright eyes, searching for any hint of weakness. Most would miss the steel beneath her innocent appearance, which only made him more eager to push her buuttons.


"Honestly, you're probably just run-down.Try looking after yourself for once," responded Grace, deadpan and unbothered. Clearly, she had no doubt her treatment was flawless.



Colton nodded.


Elsewhere in the hospital, Beatrice's phone buzzed-her mother's voice spilling through the speaker, full of complaints and demands for yet another doctor's visit.



The endless cycle of her mother's misery-usually sparked by her father's string of affairs-left Beatrice weary. Still, ignoring her mother would mean risking a public meltdown, complete with tears and drama right outside her school gates. That was a humiliation she couldn't afford.
Shoving her phone into her bag with an irritated frown, Beatrice moved toward the elevator, but something just ahead brought her to a sudden halt.


Within arm's reach, Grace was deep in conversation with a man-one so striking he seemed plucked straight from the pages of a fashion editorial. Every detail, from his composed demeanor to his custom-tailored suit, radiated power and wealth most people could only dream of.


The cold confidence in his bearing was like nothing Beatrice had ever witnessed.



Yet there was Grace standing there, clearly on friendly terms with him.


A memory flickered. Could this be the mysterious man Chloe once mentioned, the one rumored to have picked Grace up from school?
