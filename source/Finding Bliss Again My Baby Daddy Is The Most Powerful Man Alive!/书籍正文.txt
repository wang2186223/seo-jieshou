###Chapter 1 She Was Pregnant,But The Child W...
Kayla Graham was pregnant, but the child wasn't her husband's.



She stepped out of the consultation room, her hands shaking as she held the pregnancy test results. Her legs felt unsteady, and her mind hadn't caught up with the shock that had just hit her



Only a month ago, she had tied the knot with her boyfriend of five years. But on their wedding night,she found out he'd been cheating-his phone was loaded with intimate pictures of him and another woman.



Devastated, she drowned her pain in alcohol, and in her haze, she stumbled into the wrong hotel room,waking up the next morning beside a man she didn't know.



That night, she hadn't gotten a clear look at his face -only the memory of his overpowering presence,nearly suffocating, and the vast room that seemed to swallow her whole.



In the morning, too ashamed to stay, she slipped out in silence, never looking back. She never could have imagined that a single reckless night would leave her carrying that man's child.


Kayla had no idea what to do-restless, anxious, and overwhelmed.She was desperate to find a way out.


Her phone buzzed just then, snapping her back. A message from her husband, Liam Graham.


"Kayla, I'm outside the hospital,waiting for you."


Staring blankly at the screen, she slid the phone back into her pocket and moved toward the elevator without a word.



For days, the nausea and dizziness had lingered. When she could no longer brush it off, she finally went to the hospital, only to be blindsided by the news of her pregnancy.


As Kayla stepped out of the hospital, the first thing she saw was Liam's black car waiting by the curb.


Drawing in a breath, she hurried toward the car.


Liam got out of the car and walked around to open her door. He looked even more striking and refined in his crisp black suit.


"What did the doctor say?" he asked.


"Just a stomach upset," she said, voice flat. "You've always had a thing for spicy food. You'll need to ease up. It's not good for your stomach."


Kayla gave a slight nod The moment she slid into the car, a subtle trace of flowery perfume for women hit her. Liam never used air fresheners-he hated them.That scent could only mean one thing: another woman had been here



Liam reached over and gently ruffled her hair. "I'll take you home so you can get some rest. I need to return to the office for a bit."



"Okay," she mumbled.


While the car waited at a red light, Liam answered an incoming call.


Kayla shifted slightly and felt her hand graze against something soft. She reached down and pulled out a pink silk scarf.



Her eyes narrowed, fixed on the scarf-it looked far too familiar to be a coincidence. She had once seen the scarf in one of the pictures on his phone.


When Liam hung up, he turned with a warm smile."Kayla, I'lI drop you off first, then I-"


She interrupted him, raising the scarf. Her voice was sharp and firm. "Who does this belong to?" Liam's eyes flashed with a hint of panic, but he covered it up with a strained chuckle. "Must be from a client earlier today. I'll return it tomorrow."


He reached for the scarf,but Kayla yanked it back and said defiantly, "Liam, I want a divorce."


Liam threw back his head in disbelief. "Kayla, it's just a scarf! Why are you blowing this out of proportion?You can't throw the word 'divorce' around like it means nothing."



Kayla gave a cold, humorless laugh. "How much longer were you going to keep lying? You left me on our wedding night for her,didn't you?"


Liam stared at her, stunned, a rare disoriented look in his eyes. "It was a last-minute meeting. You've got it all wrong."



Kayla had no interest in hearing his excuses.He had betrayed her, and now she carried another man's child.Their marriage was beyond saving.



"Out of respect for the years we've shared, let's end this peacefully," she said, her tone icy.


Without waiting for a response, she pushed open the door and stepped out.


Liam sat motionless behind the wheel, his fingers  clenched so tightly they turned white. Then, with a furious roar,he slammed his fist against the steering wheel.



Kayla took a taxi home. As she stepped into the living room， her eyes landed on their wedding photo一framed perfectly at the center, the two of them beaming with joy. Now, the image struck her as bitterly ironic.


On the night of their wedding, she had seen explicit images of Liam with Tricia Moss, tangled in compromising poses.


That single blow had shattered everything. Five years of loyalty had meant nothing.


Kayla dropped to her knees, hands pressed tightly to her chest as the anguish she'd bottled up came crashing out in a flood of raw emotion.


Tears spilled freely, refusing to stop.


She didn't know how much time had passed before her sobs finally quieted. All she knew was the emptiness that followed.



Liam arrived home late that night.


Kayla lay still in the bed, facing away. When he pressed against her back, she didn't flínch. Instead, she shut her eyes His skin carried the chill of the night as he wrapped his arm around her over the blanket. "Let's stop fighting,Kayla. I'm sorry for earlier. It won't happen again.I love you."


She shifted, pulling away from his touch.



Liam let out a low chuckle, his voice smooth, almost teasing. He undressed quickly and slid toward her.


"Let's have sex tonight. Your period should be over by now,right?"
###Chapter 2 The Man She Had Slept With Was Her...
On their wedding night, Liam had come home past midnight. That night, Kayla had claimed she was on her period to avoid being intimate with him. And now.after everything, he still believed that saying sorry would magically erase what he had done.


"Get out of my room!" Kayla pushed herself upright in bed, her tone frigid and final as she shut him down.


Liam's desire fizzled out instantly. He ran a hand over his face, annoyed. "Can you stop overreacting? I know you're upset, but I'm not going to keep walking on eggshells. My patience has its limits."


"Are you deaf? Get out!" Kayla's tone didn't change,and her expression didn't soften



Trying a gentler approach, Liam coaxed, "We're married now. Let's forget the past. I'll be better from now on, I swear."



An unfaithful man was no different from something rotting on the street.



Standing up, Kayla grabbed her pillow with one hand "I'll sleep in the guest room." Liam's irritation was written all over his face. To him,she was overreacting-completely blowing things out of proportion. He had already said he was sorry, yet she treated him like his apology meant nothing. In his eyes, she should've been rational enough to let it go by now.



"Fine. Go ahead. Sleep wherever the hell you want."


Without another word, Kayla picked up her phone and laptop,ignoring him completely.



Liam turned over in the bed, glaring at her as she walked out. "Don't forget tomorrow's family banquet.You're coming with me. We've been married for a week. It'll be a joke if you don't show up."



He swore quietly under his breath and hurled a pillow onto the floor, unable to hold in his rage.



Kayla didn't answer, but her expression made her feelings clear. She wasn't going because she wanted to. She was going because Liam had threatened to sell the Cooper Group if she didn't.


Cooper Group was her mother's life's work-a legacy built through years of sacrifice. She had poured everything into the company, pushing herself beyond her limits, until the constant pressure finally took her life. And it was all she'd left behind. The next day, the couple visited the ancestral mansion of the Graham family-a powerful name in Trark


When Liam's sleek black car rolled to a stop in front of the mansion, the butler was already outside to stop him. "This space is for family only. Outsiders need to park elsewhere."


Not even a hint of respect for Liam. But Kayla wasn't the least bit surprised-she had witnessed this kind of contempt more times than she could count. Without a word, she opened the car door and stepped out,positioning herself to the side.



Although Liam carried the Graham name, he was little more than a shadow on the family tree. His mother was the illegitimate daughter of Johnny Graham, the family patriarch. Years ago, she had marrieda poor man, despite Johnny's furious objections. As punishment, he severed ties with her


As Liam grew older, his mother realized she couldn't give him the kind of future he needed. Desperate to change his fate, she pushed him back toward the family that had rejected her. She made him take on the Graham surname, thinking it might open a door


But it never did. Each visit to the Graham family brought nothing but scorn. Still, Liam held on to the idea that one day, he'd prove his worth. The company he now boasted about-Perennia Group -had been built off Kayla's money It started with hundreds of thousands of dollars she gave him And when Cooper Group later stepped in to support him,the business grew fast. In a few years, it became a name people noticed


But now, Kayla felt like it had all been a terrible waste A reward for betrayal, handed over by her own misguided trust



Liam moved the car to a different spot, hoping to avoid further conflict, but the butler still stood firm



Finally, Liam snapped, "What, I don't even get a parking spot in my own home now?"



The butler gave a slight bow, that ever-present smug smile playing on his lips. "My apologies, sir We simply don't have room for uninvited guests"



Liam's face flushed crimson, his fists clenched at his sides. He looked like he wanted to lash out but couldn't.



Kayla felt a small flicker of satisfaction watching him get cut down to size.



Just then, a series of sleek black sedans began pulling into the driveway The butler's entire posture changed Panic flickered across his face as he waved his arms  "Move the car! Move it! Mr Jeremy Graham has returned!"



Jeremy Graham, Johnny's youngest son, stood first in line for succession to the Graham family In Trark, he ruled on the surface and in the shadows with a firm,unyielding grip, the kind of figure whose name alone could silence a room



Kayla watched as the sleek black cars approached Without hesitation, the butler rushed forward,hurrying to open the door of the car at the center



Jeremy stepped out slowly His crisp suit and polished shoes shone under the lights. Everything about him radiated dominance.


The sheer presence he carried was enough to make anyone feel unsettled.


Kayla's eyes drifted to his hand, where a ring glinted under the streetlights.


Her breath caught She had seen that ring before-in the hotel room that night


How could it be him?



She looked up, heart pounding, and met his eyes-those deep-set,unreadable eyes



The man she had slept with was her husband's uncle
###Chapter 3 Had He Seen Her Face That Night
Jeremy towered above everyone else, his height impossible to ignore There was something about him,a quiet intensity, polished and powerful Even without trying, he drew every pair of eyes



He wore a sleek black suit that spoke of quiet luxury,every detail immaculate. His face was flawless-strikingly handsome, yet distant



Kayla caught her breath. The sight of him made her freeze. He was too striking Too composed


When Jeremy's gaze brushed over her, her heart skipped and she dropped her eyes instinctively



Thankfully, his eyes moved on, and he walked off with his entourage, each step unhurried


Liam finally managed to park the car, though he had to squeeze it in near a reeking bin



"Kayla, shall we go in?" he asked, extending his hand to her



She took a step back, her tone cool "I'll be fine on my own." He hesitated but held himself back. Causing a scene here wasn't worth it. "Alright," he murmured.


The family banquet passed without Jeremy making an appearance. Kayla's shoulders loosened just a little.



If he had been there, she would've been a wreck,unable to sit still.


When she excused herself to the bathroom, she didn't actually go inside. Instead, she slipped out into the garden,craving air and distance



The main hall buzzed with conversation and music,but out here, the quiet pressed in from all sides.



Everything about this estate reeked of power-wealth carved into marble paths and whispering fountains. No wonder Liam had tried so desperately to claw his way back.Who wouldn't?



Kayla let her feet lead the way. Soon,she realized she didn't know where she was anymore.



She eventually stumbled upon a pond, where she suddenly heard a commotion.



A man was being hauled over by two bodyguards, his head shoved beneath the surface of the pond.



He screamed in panic, swearing he didn't know  anything, his voice cracking with fear


More bodyguards surrounded them-at least a dozen their black uniforms like shadows



Kayla dove behind a bush and clasped a hand over her mouth, her heart pounding like it wanted to escape her chest



They only dragged the man out when he was seconds from drowning, then hurled him onto the ground like he was nothing more than trash


"Mr Graham. I swear, I don't know who was in the room that night! I didn't see anything!"


One of the bodyguards slammed a fist into his face "Still pretending you don't know?" he growled


"I swear, I don't! I nodded off-I didn't see anything,l promisel"



There was a loud crack His scream echoed off the stone One of his fingers had just been snapped clean



Kayla's entire body went stiff She felt cold, sweat clinging to her skin



Jeremy was the man from that night And he was clearly looking for answers



That meant he didn't know she was the woman from  that night


A wave of fear surged through Kayla, tangled with a thin thread of relief She had to get out Now



Just as she turned to slip away, two bodyguards stepped into her path



"There's someone here," one of them said sharply



Kayla froze and forced a smile "I was just passing by I didn't see anything, I swear"


Edwin Bailey, Jeremy's assistant, gave her a quck assessing look before turning his head and sald, "Mr Graham, it's Liam's wife



A silence followed Then, a deep, smooth voice answered,"Bring her here "



Before Kayla could react, they grabbed her She was hauled forward and shoved so roughly she stumbled


Her throat tightened as she stood, head bowed, too frightened to meet his eyes



He was lounging on a chaise longue A black V-neck clung to his frame, and his loose, tailored trousers hung just right. The lighting veiled part of his face,but what was visible looked like a masterpiece



Then his eyes found her She looked so small standing there Fragile, even Her long lashes trembled,her fear plain in every movement Something about her vulnerability seemed to stir something faint in him



"Look up," he said, voice low but firm


Kayla clutched her dress in tight fists. She bit her lip before slowly lifting her gaze



Their eyes locked His expression gave away nothing "Why are you here?"



"I got lost," she whispered "I didn't mean to interrupt anything"



"Lost?" His tone was icy. "Or did Liam send you to sniff around?"



"Nol Absolutely not! I swear!" She raised her hand as if taking an oath, but his stare remained cool, unmoved


Thankfully, he didn't push the issue. With a flick of his hand, he signaled the guards to let her go


Relief washed over her, but she only managed a few shaky steps before her stomach twisted violently The nausea surged out of nowhere.



She spotted a bin near his chaise longue and rushed toward it



But her balance faltered-she slipped, missed the  edge, and fell hard against him, collapsing into his arms as she retched.



Unbelievable.



The bodyguards jolted in surprise and rushed forward,ready to pull her off him without hesitation.



Jeremy's face darkened. He lifted a hand, halting them.



Kayla gagged a few more times against his chest before the wave of nausea passed. Thankfully,nothing came up. It was just dry heaving.



He pushed her off, his jaw tight.



"Did Liam send you to seduce me?" His voice was sharp,laced with ice and barely contained fury.



Kayla landed on the ground, disoriented, and blinked up at him. "I wasn't feeling well. I'm sorry. You won't blame me, right? We're family."


Jeremy furrowed his brow. This woman was clever-she knew how to exploit the situation.


The light shifted, catching her face in fuL. She looked pale and scared.


"I'll leave now," she mumbled, starting to rise."Goodbye, Jeremy." But she hadn't made it far before his hand closed around her wrist.



His eyes locked onto hers again-sharp, unblinking, as if he could see past the trembling exterior



Kayla's chest tightened. Did he know? Had he seen her face that night?
 ###Chapter 4 Divorce Liam Before Her Pregnancy ...   
"Kayla!" Liam's voice rang out from afar.


Jeremy's brows knit slightly before he let go of Kayla's wrist. "You can go."



She didn't wait-she turned and rushed off immediately.





Edwin stepped forward, offering him a handkerchief."Mr. Graham, what just happened?"



Jeremy took the handkerchief,wiping his hands slowly,his expression unreadable. "Nothing. I thought she looked familiar-like the woman from that night-but I must have been mistaken."



"Don't worry, sir. I'll figure out who snuck into your room that night. Just give me a little more time."


"Alright."



Jeremy's eyes drifted away, a strange look passing across his face.



He couldn't forget the woman from that night. She'd seemed so untouched, trembling under his fingertips,  tears running silently down her cheeks.



He still remembered her eyes-clear and bright,drawing him in irresistibly



Meanwhile, Kayla spotted Liam scanning the area,clearly searching for her.



She calmed herself and walked over. "I'm here."



Liam rushed toward her, gripping her shoulders tightly."Where were you? I thought something had happened.I was worried sick."



Kayla instinctively leaned back, inching away from his hold. "I'm fine."



Liam glanced over her shoulder, clearly wanting to ask more, but she'd already started walking ahead, cutting the conversation short.



That night, sleep refused to come. Kayla tossed in bed,her mind haunted by Jeremy's face.



She never imagined that he-the man from that night -would turn out to be Liam's uncle. The thought alone was enough to make her stomach twist.


She had heard the stories. Jeremy was ruthless. The kind of man who crushed competitors without blinking.He wasn't someone you crossed. Her hand moved instinctively to her stomach. She couldn't keep this baby. If the Graham family found out,the consequences would be beyond anything she could handle.



She'd go to the hospital in the morning and take care of it-quietly, before things got worse.


With her decision made, Kayla slipped out of bed to grab a glass of water. As she reached the staircase,she heard Liam's voice downstairs, sharp and angry.



"This project has to go through, no matter what.I don't care how you do it; finda way to fill that funding gap. We've already poured too much into it. Failure isn't an option."



He sounded angry, and once the call ended,he hung up with a sharp, frustrated motion.


Kayla couldn't help but wonder what had gone wrong with the company to leave him sounding so frantic.



The sound of the front door opening and shutting echoed through the empty hallway.


Liam walked out, started his car, and drove off.


Kayla made her way downstairs, filled a glass with water in the quiet kitchen. Then, her phone buzzed with a message from her private investigator. 
"Mrs. Graham, Mr Graham has gone to Tricia's. He's likely staying the night."


A faint, mocking smile tugged at Kayla's lips. There was no hurt left. Only a hollow calm where disappointment used to live.


The next morning, she drove herself to the hospital.


She'd expected it to be simple and quick. But the doctor's words shattered every bit of that hope.


"Ma'am, your uterine lining is quite thin. In your condition, undergoing an abortion could make it difficult, if not impossible, for you to conceive again."


Kayla sat frozen, the words echoing in her ears.


She couldn't go through with the abortion,yet carrying the baby wasn't something she could risk either.She was trapped.


The doctor's voice softened. "Maybe talk this through with your husband. This isn't a small decision-it carries real risks."



"I understand," she muttered.



Kayla left the room feeling like she'd just been hit by a wave. Her thoughts spun out of control. If she didn't end the pregnancy, she'd eventually have  to give birth, and there was no way Liam wouldn't find out.



There was only one way forward now: divorce Liam before her pregnancy became noticeable.



Still lost in thought, Kayla didn't see the figure in front of her and ran straight into someone's chest.



"Mr Graham,are you alright?"


Kayla's heart dropped. She looked up and found Jeremy standing there, tall and still as a statue, those intense eyes locked on her like she was a puzzle he was about to solve.



Stunned, Kayla instinctively tucked the medical report behind her back. "Jeremy?"



Jeremy didn't reply. He studied her closely, sensing something off. She'd been acting strange the night before and still was.



The bodyguard pointed to the floor and reminded her,"You knocked over Mr. Graham's medication."


Only then did she notice the bag of pills spilled near her feet-various bottles, all supplements for sexual stamina.



Jeremy looked strong and full of energy, yet he apparently relied on supplements. But that night, his  stamina had been unquestionable-he hadn't seemed like someone who needed any help.



Kayla glanced up, eyes flickering with quiet disbelief and a strange mix of curiosity.
###Chapter 5 Let's Stop Talking About Divorce
Jeremy's expression changed in an instant. His voice turned sharp. "What are you staring at?"


"Nothing. Sorry, I'll pick it up."


Kayla quickly bent to retrieve the bottles from the floor, but her movement was too quick, and her dress shifted with her.The neckline dipped lower than she'd meant it to, and from where Jeremy stood, the view of her cleavage was impossible to miss.


As she rose, trying to compose herself, he stepped forward and draped his jacket over her shoulders. A faint scent of sandalwood clung to it.



"Did Liam ask you to dress like this and throw yourself at me?"



Without giving her a chance to respond, he turned and walked away.


Kayla stood there, stunned, her mind racing to catch up.But the moment it sank in, her cheeks flushed with anger."What the hell!"



Jeremy was exactly as the rumors claimed-cold,  heartless, and impossible to deal with.


In the car, he tossed the bag of bottles aside like it didn't matter "Tell my father's doctor to send the medication to his place from now on. I'm not picking it up again."


Edwin nodded from the passenger seat. "Understood,Mr.Graham."



Jeremy's eyes lingered on the hospital building through the window. "Any update on that woman?"



"I'll push harder on the search,"Edwin replied,his tone calm and steady.



After leaving the hospital, Kayla drove straight to Perennia Group.



She still remembered when she and Liam had chosen the company name together. Back then, it was jst a dream. Now, the business had growNn fast, and Liam was rubbing shoulders with the elite.



Laughter echoed from the general manager's office,light and playful, followed by a woman's soft giggle that sounded sweet and teasing.


Without knocking, Kayla pushed the door open.


Tricia was on her knees between Liam's legs,her body moving in a way that left nothing to the imagination. Seeing Kayla, Tricia sprang to her feet and moved to the side. Her blouse was unbuttoned halfway, showing off a plunging neckline that revealed her cleavage.



Her cheeks looked flushed, her hair slightly messy, and her smile sugary sweet. "Mrs. Graham, what a surprise."



Liam turned to look at his wife, his face paling with fluster for a second. "Kayla?"



Kayla stood rooted to the spot, her eyes icy as they swept over the scene. The sight alone made her stomach twist in disgust.


"Did I walk in on something?"she asked with a sneer.


"What? No. My pen dropped, that's all. She was just picking it up." Liam walked to the door and turned sharply to Tricia. "Get out."


Tricia didn't argue. She passed by Kayla on her way out, her perfume trailing in the air-the same one Kayla always smelt on Liam.



The message was loud and clear


Trying to play it off, Liam poured her a glass of water and said, "Kayla, I'm glad you stopped by. Let's go out for lunch. We could talk."



"I'm not here for lunch. I came to talk about our  divorce."



The glass slipped fromn Liam's hand, hit the floor, and shattered, sending water splashing in all directions.



He stepped aside, rubbing his temples like he was holding back a headache. "Kayla, how long are you going to keep this up? I can understand if you've just been in a bad mood lately, but if this is about Tricia,I'll fire her right now."



Kayla didn't even blink. She wasn't here to argue. She reached into her bag and pulled out a folder, setting it firmly on the table. "I'm not here to fight over anything. After the divorce, Perennia Group will be yours. I won't contest it. But I want my share of the money back.And I want Cooper Group returned to me."



A sharp flash of annoyance crossed Liam's face.His jaw tightened with rage. "We're married. We're in love.How can you be talking about divorce?"



"Love?" Kayla laughed coldly. Liam claimed to love her,yet he was in bed with someone else. So this wNas what his version of love looked like.



"I've made up my mind. Sign the divorce agreement.Don't drag this out." She slammed the document down on the desk with finality.



Liam looked down at the document, and for a brief moment, something vulnerable passed through his 
 eyes. "Kayla, what are you doing? Are you really going to throw everything away? After everything we've been through?”



But Kayla had long let go of any hope for them. Her voice was cold, flat. "Sign it. Let's end this completely."


"End it?" Liam's expression turned pained. "Just like that? After all these years together, you can just walk away? I love you, Kayla. I said I'd always take care of you."



She closed her eyes, took a breath, and said steadily,"Spare me the speeches. I'll believe what I see, not what you say. And I won't change my mind-Cooper Group must be returned to me."



Liam's face darkened, and his voice turned defensive."You gave me Cooper Group yourself. My company is in trouble right now-the accounts are in the red. I'm doing everything I can to save it. Once the major projects go through, I'll take Cooper Group back. Just give me some time. And stop mentioning divorce."



It was clear now-he'd mortgaged Cooper Group,and getting it back wouldn't be simple.



"Liam, you're shameless!" Kayla's voice trembled with disbelief. He knew exactly what Cooper Group meant to her, and he still used it like it was nothing.



"Kayla, we built Perennia Group together. You don't want to see it fall apart, do you? Using Cooper Group was just a temporary fix. Please, let's stop talking about divorce. I'll give you whatever you want."



Liam stepped forward and wrapped his arms around her from behind,lowering his head to inhale the scent of her hair.



Disgusted, Kayla jerked free and spun around, slapping him hard across the face.



Liam's head snapped sideways at the impact, and five red finger marks bloomed on his cheek.



He slowly raised a hand to his face, his eyes blazing as he turned back to her, teeth clenched."Why are you being like this? I've already tried to make it right What more do you want?"



"You did this, not me. This marriage is over. I'm done!"
###Chapter 6 Information About The Woman From...
"Mr. Graham." Tricia rushed into the office,clutching a thick stack of documents. Her eyes flicked toward Kayla with a smug glint.


Liam,barely keeping his temper in check,lowered his voice."What is it?"



"North Investment turned us down. They sent back the invitation letter and all the project documents."



"UJseless!" he snapped.



Perennia Group was in a bind-deep in financial trouble and fast running out of options. North Investment, the powerhouse of Trark's investment scene, had the means to turn things around in a heartbeat if they got involved.



The head of North Investment was his uncle, and Liam had assumed that being family would be enough to secure their support.



Tricia paused for a mnoment, then asked, "Mr. Graham,what now? If we don't get the funds soon, Perennia Group is done for." Liam turned to look at Kayla. Back in the early days,she'd been the one to bring in most of the company's big deals. Calm, sharp, relentless-she made things happen.



He snatched the documents from Tricia and flung them toward Kayla. "Didn't you want a divorce? If you can get North Investment on our side,I'll think about it."



Kayla snatched the documents and shot him a firm look. "You'd better mean it. Don't you dare go back on your word."



Without waiting for a response, she turned and left with the documents.



As the door clicked shut, Tricia stepped closer,clutching Liam's arm. "How can you count on her? If you couldn't convince them, what makes you think she can?"



Liam shoved her off and barked, "Don't cling to me at work. If Kayla finds out what's going on between us,I'll make sure you regret it."



Tricia froze, her face turning pale. Her expression turned brittle as shepouted."Why would you say that?She's already done with you. If she loved you,she wouldn't be walking away." 
Liam's jaw tightened. He gave her a sharp look. "I don't care what you think. Kayla is the only woman I've ever loved. And if it weren't for your games, I'd never have gotten invoved with you in the first place."


Tears gathered in Tricia's eyes as she gripped the documents tightly, her knuckles white from the strain


Liam loosened his tie, exhaling sharply. "Leave.I don't want to see you right now."


Tricia bit her lower lip, fighting the sting behind her eyes. "Yes, Mr. Graham."


She backed out and closed the door behind her, then stood just outside, her face twisting with bitterness.


What did Kayla have that she didn't? Why did he still look at her like that?



At a quiet cafe down the street, Kayla sat with the project files spread out in front of her.Her brows were furrowed in thought.


Jeremy,the CEO of North Investment, wasn't going to be easy. He was smart, guarded, and far from sentimental.



But with the way things stood, she didn't have the luxury of backing off. She had to try As she stared at the pages, wondering where to begin,the low rumble of an engine caught her attention.Across the road, a black Rolls-Royce glided to a stop.



The door opened. Jeremy stepped out, flanked by a few associates, and headed into the bar across the street.



Kayla pursed her lips, grabbed her bag, and went after him.



The bar was buzzing. Music thumped, people laughed loudly, and drinks flowed without pause.



The noise and smell turned her stomach, but she pushed through them. As she made her way toward the private rooms upstairs, security stepped in and blocked her path.



"You can't go up there. Turn around,please."



"I'm here to see someone," she replied quickly



Without another word, the guards grabbed her shoulders,already steering her back toward the door



Then, from the corner of her eye, Kayla noticed a tall figure standing in the hallway. Taking a deep breath,she gathered her courage and called out,"Jeremy!"



Jeremy stopped in his tracks and glanced back at her, his face calm and unreadable



The guards froze, clearly caught off guard. She knew Jeremy?



They let go of her instantly



Kayla didn't waste a second. She hurried over with a bright, overly sweet smile.



Jeremy didn't move, hands tucked in his pockets,eyeing her with quiet suspicion. Last time they crossed paths, she had seemed to be walking on eggshells.Now she was suddenly all smiles? It didn't add up.


"Jeremy! What a surprise! I was just passing by and spotted you."



Jeremy didn't respond. He simply turned and walked into one of the private rooms withouta word.



Kayla faltered at the doorway. Was she supposed to go in? After a second of uncertainty, se followed.



Inside the room, the first thing she noticed was the man in the red shirt.



"Buddy, who's this beauty? Don't tell me she's your new flame." Dewitt Nicolson smirked, mischief lacing his voice as he threw a glance Jeremy's way.



Jeremy said nothing, sinking into the seat at the  center of the room and ignoring Kayla's presence



Dewitt kept staring His eyes narrowed slightly, as though something had clicked in his mind. "Wait a second..I know that face Where have I have seen it before?"



After a while, he smacked his thigh as it clicked "That's it! I saw you at some banquet-you're Liam's wife. So what brings you here with Jeremy tonight?"



He laughed out loud, but Jeremy shot him a sharp look that shut him up immediately



"Hello, I'm Kayla," Kayla said, introducing herself with calm composure



She didn't care about the teasing or the assumptions This meeting mattered too much. She needed Jeremy's help if she was ever going to end things cleanly with Liam.


"Mind if I sit here?" she asked, gesturing to a seat near Jeremy



"Leave," Jeremy said, flat and cold


Dewitt raised his hands in mock protest. "Aw, don't be so heartless. She's family, isn't she? Let her stay. She's not hurting anyone."



Trying to steady herself,Kayla sat down-nervous,but  determined



Jeremy didn't even glance her way, acting like she wasn't there at all.



But Dewitt? He was watching her closely, grinning to himself



The situation was full of irony and entertainment.Jeremy had never hidden his disdain for Liam,and now here he was, in a room with Liam's wife.



Kayla was just about to say something when Edwin walked into the room



He gave a small nod. "Mr. Graham, we've found information about the woman from that night."


Kayla's heart dropped. Her fingers curled tightly around the hem of her dress. Suddenly,the room felt too small, the air too heavy. Her instinct screamed at her to run.
###Chapter 7 Something About Her Doesn't Sit Wight Wit...
"Did you find her?" Dewitt asked eagerly."Who is it?"


Edwin hesitated, glancing toward Kayla, who sat quietly on the sofa. He was just about to ask if she wanted to step out when Jeremy cut in,"Bring them in."



Kayla pursed her lips, instinctively trying to think of a reason to excuse herself. But before she could speak,Edwin turned and opened the door to the private room.A small group of women walked in.


Kayla's shoulders relaxed a little-until she spotted Zoe Cooper,her half-sister. Her heart began to thump again.



What on earth was Zoe doing here?



"Just these few?" Dewitt asked, unimpressed. He mumbled under his breath, "They don't even come close to Liam's wife in looks."



Kayla cast a quick glance at Jeremy, trying to read his expression. His face was blank, cold,and uninterested.He didn't seem moved by any of the women.



Could he tell none of these women were the one he  was looking for?


"Look up," Jeremy said, his voice flat but filled with a command that left no room for question


The women lifted their heads, their eyes instantly drawn to him. For a moment, they all looked slightly stunned by his striking appearance.



Zoe's eyes darted to Kayla, brimming with scorn and annoyance. She had heard rumors about Kayla marrying into the Graham family, but nothing had prepared her for the sight of her half-sister in the same room with Jeremy.



Then,in a calculated move, Zoe turned to Jeremy and gasped, "So you're Mr. Graham!"


Her theatrics caught Jeremy's attention. His head turned slowly toward her, his eyes cold but curious



Kayla let out a small, silent sigh and rolled her eyes.Typical Zoe.



"And your name is?" Jeremy asked, his tone neutral


"Zoe Cooper," she answered, her voice soft, with the faintest quiver.



Edwin stepped forward and gently pulled Zoe to the front of the group. 
A glint from her chest caught Jeremy's eye Without a word, he reached out and plucked a brooch from her dress.



Kayla's stomach dropped. That brooch. She had noticed it was missing after that night. She had thought it had slipped off somewhere along the way But now, she realized that Jeremy must have found it



Their father had ordered two of those brooches. One for Kayla. One for Zoe.



Kayla's pulse quickened. If Zoe told Jeremy she had the brooch too, it could lead to real trouble.



Jeremy studied the brooch carefully, then looked straight at Zoe. "Is this yours?"



"Yes," Zoe said with a smile that danced dangerously close to flirtation. She stepped in closer."If you like it,you can have it."


"What's your name?" Jeremy asked again.



"Zoe Cooper," she repeated.



"Where were you last Monday night, around nine?"


"In a hotel," Zoe answered right away, without pause.


Jeremy gave a slow nod. He handed the brooch back to her, then turned to Edwin. "No need to continue  Escort them out. Make sure Ms. Cooper gets home safely."


"Understood," Edwin replied with a respectful nod. He could tell Jeremy confirmed Zoe was the woman from that night.


Kayla's heart was racing. No, this couldn't be happening. He couldn't seriously think it was Zoe.That woman was a professional liar. But what could she do? She couldn't step forward and claim it was her.



While her thoughts swirled in panic, Edwin had already ushered Zoe and the others out of the room.



Jeremy turned back to Kayla. His sharp eyes settled on her, his brow slightly furrowed. "You know what to do about tonight."


Kayla didn't hesitate. "Don't worry. I won't say a word."


"Leave," he said, his tone final.


Kayla froze. She hadn't even gotten to discuss the collaboration she came here for.


Before she could speak, Dewitt-still grinning and obviously tipsy-called out, "Looks like she doesn't want to leave. Besides, isn't it great? She got to witness you finding your mystery woman tonight." "You talk too much," Jeremy snapped, giving him a sharp look before turning and walking away.


Kayla jumped to her feet and followed after him.



Edwin, who had come back after sending the women out of the room, asked with a slight frown, "Do you think Zoe was really the woman from that night?Something about her doesn't sit right with me."



Dewitt shrugged, leaning back in his chair. "He was the one who spent the night with her. He'd know better than any of us. Let's just sit back and see how it plays out."
 ###Chapter 8 Save That Talk



Outside on the terrace, Jeremy leaned against the railing, his stillness suggesting he'd been expecting Kayla


"Why are you suddenly hovering around me today?What's going on?" he asked.


Kayla's lips curled into a sweet smile. "I just saw you standing here and thought I'd stop by to say hello."



"This is your final opportunity. Don't throw it away."There was a sharpness in his voice now, and the faint trace of irritation flickered across his face.



Kayla's smile wavered for just a moment. Stepping forward,she reached into her bag and pulled out a folder. "This is the project proposal for Perennia Group. I'm hoping you'll take another look and give us a second chance."



So that was her realreason for coming.



Jeremy didn't spare the folder a single glance. His sharp nose and defined features gave him a cold,distant look, while his eyes held a blend of calm detachment and authority. A small firm-what reason do I have to partner with Liam? I'm not running a charity."


"Then consider it a favor. One small move from you could save a company and earn you a powerful ally,"she pleaded.



Jeremy's quiet chuckle carried a faint edge of contempt.



He turned, eyes narrowing as he gave her a long,cutting once-over. "Did Liam put you up to this?Sending a woman to do business-he's turning that general manager title into a joke."



"No, I came of my own accord. I intend to win this project myself."



Just then, Edwin approached with a brisk stride. "Mr.Graham, the office called. There's a situation that needs your attention."


Jeremy didn't respond to her. Without a backward glance,he walked off.


Kayla started to go after him, but Edwin stepped into her path. "Ma'am,please control yourself."



She could only stand still and watch them disappear down the corridor. But she wasn't giving up. Jeremy would come around -she'd make sure of it.



As she turned to leave, a sharp, female voice rang out behind her.



"Kayla, what were you doing in the private room just now?"



She glanced up to find Zoe approaching,wearing an elegant designer dress, a high-end handbag swinging confidently at her side.



Kayla met Zoe's smug look with a frosty stare. "Is this your property? What I do here doesn't concern you."


Zoe's lips twisted into a smirk. "Maybe not, but dragging the Cooper name through the mud in public isn't something I can ignore. Does Liam even know you're out tonight? You think you belong anywhere near Jeremy?"



Kayla gave a quiet, contemptuous laugh. "Jeremy is my husband's uncle. Sharing a meal with him isn't exactly scandalous. Meanwhile, you're the one skulking around, desperate for his approval"



Unfazed, Zoe tilted her chin, tapping the jeweled brooch pinned proudly to her chest. "And what if l am?Jeremy has been searching for the woman who owns this brooch. Other than you, I'm the only one with it You're married now, which means I'm the only candidate left."



Kayla's eyes narrowed with quiet intensity Her suspicions were confirmed-Jeremy really was looking for someone based on the brooch she'd once lost



A woman like Zoe wouldn't waste asecond exploiting an opportunity to climb higher


Still, Kayla couldn't risk confronting her without exposing herself



While Kayla weighed her options, Zoe pulled a document from her bag and tossed it in her face



"By the way,you should know-Dad's decided to stop covering your grandmother's medical fees. You'll have to take care of it yourself. Since you're running Cooper Group nowv, it's not our responsibility anymore."



Kayla said in a cold, lethal voice, "You guys caused my grandmother's fall and her dementia. Only a year has passed, and you think you can just walk away from it?That's not going to happen."



Zoe scoffed, eyes burning with defiance. "Take it up with Dad if you're so upset. You think marrying Liam makes you someone important? Without the Cooper family's support, he would still be nobody. Jeremy is the true head of the Graham family. Once I marry him,you'll be answering to me." "Save that talk for when you've actually married Jeremy." Without looking back, Kayla walked off



Behind her, Zoe stomped the floor in frustration and yelled,"Kayla, watch and see!"
###Chapter 9 Confront Her Stepmother And Half-sister
The next morning, just as Kayla was getting ready to resume talks with Jeremy about the business collaboration, her phone rang. The call was from the care facility.



Her grandmother had suddenly relapsed and had been rushed to the emergency room.



By the time Kayla got there, the crisis had passed and her grandmother's condition was stable.


She turned to the doctor, her voice tense. "Dr.Crawford, you mentioned before that my grandmother was improving. How did things go downhill so fast?"



Adair Crawford replied honestly,"Yesterday, your stepmother and sister came to visit. I'm not sure what they said, but shortly after they left, her condition worsened. And..."



A chill ran down Kayla's spine. "And what?"



"They canceled her upcoming treatment and requested a refund for the unused portion of the fees." Kayla's face hardened Zoe had already mentioned they wouldn't continue covering the expenses-and now they were backing out completely



She said firmly, "My grandmother's treatment must continue without interruption. Dr. Crawford, please keep monitoring her closely. I'll handle the payments myself"



Adair gave a respectful nod. "Understood."



Inside the hospital room, the elderly woman lay unconscious, her skin ashen and drawn.



Kayla sat beside her, cradling her grandmother's frail hand,her chest tight with emotion.



"I won't let anything happen to you,Grandma.If Zoe and her mother want to play dirty, they're going to pay for it."


By nightfall, her grandmother stirred awake and managed to drink a little soup.


Kayla remained at her side, chatting with her until her grandmother drifted off to sleep. Then she quietly left the facility.



Once outside, she called the Coopers. The housekeeper answered, informing her that Zoe and her mother were out attending a banquet at a private  club



Kayla asked for the location, thanked the woman curtly, and headed there without delay.



Hollowlyn Club was one of Trark's most exclusive venues



At the front desk, she introduced herself as a friend of Zoe's. The staff told her the private room number without question



The lavish interior spoke volumes; this was a place where the wealthy came to indulge



As Kayla reached the hallway leading to the private suite, she spotted Zoe just steps from the door



"Zoe, don't take another step."



Kayla closed the distance in a few long strides and yanked Zoe aside by the arm.


Zoe, draped in an elegant evening gown and polished makeup, stood frozen in disbelief. "Kayla? What are you doing here?"



"You showed up at the care facility yesterday, said God knows what, and left my grandmother so distressed she fell ill. This ends now."



Zoe curled her lips into a sneer. "That's it? I thought  something serious had happened. Honestly, that old woman's been clinging to life for too long.Instead of wasting money on her, why not let her die peacefully at home?"



Before she could finish, Kayla struck her with a sharp slap across the face.



The slap sent Zoe reeling into the doorframe, her cheek flaring crimson in seconds.



Zoe shrieked, livid. "You hit me!"



Kayla flexed her wrist and scoffed."You earned it."



Zoe glared at her with hatred. "You're just like your mother-vile and shameless. No wonder Dad left you If not for the two of you, Cooper Group would still be ours. You've always been a curse."


When Kayla lifted her hand again, Zoe lunged for the door,shoved it open,and bolted inside.


Her voice turned into a pitiful wail. "Kayla,stop! Don't hit me again-we're family!"



Kayla was caught off guard by her abrupt change in behavior but followed her into the room nonetheless.



She was taken aback when everyone inside turned their attention toward her. At the head of the table sat a man whose presence commanded attention-refined, magnetic, and radiating power. The moment their eyes met, Kayla's breath caught in her throat.


She hadn't expected to find Jeremy here.


The table overflowed with elegantly prepared dishes,with Zoe and her mother, Amaya Cooper, seated close by.


So they had come for Jeremy's banquet?



Amaya looked startled as her eyes fell on Kayla Without hesitation,she pulled Zoe into her arms, her tone dripping with concern. "Zoe, what happened,sweetheart?"



Still in tears, Zoe stole a glance at the man at the table before she spoke in a voice thick with emotion."I saw Kayla in the hallway. She slapped me and accused me of hurting her grandmother. But I didn't do anything! She wouldn't even let me explain. I'm so heartbroken."



Amaya turned to Kayla, feigning gentleness. "Kayla, if something's wrong, we should talk things through.Violence never solves anything."



Kayla took in the insincere show put on by Amaya and Zoe, her stomach turning with a sudden surge of  nausea.



Pregnancy had sharpened her senses, leaving her emotionally raw and physically fragile, and the heavy scent of food in the room only worsened her nausea.
###Chapter 10 You've Finally Dropped The Act
Kayla struggled to keep the nausea down as she glared at Zoe. Her voice was cold and sharp. "You know exactly what you've done. Let me be clear-if anything happens to my grandmother,I will hold you responsible."



Jeremy sat quietly to the side, his expression unreadable. He had no intention of getting involved in their family drama.



But Zoe tried to spin the situation to her advantage-using Kayla's anger to paint herself as gentle and virtuous.



She gave a soft, sweet smile and turned to Jeremy "Mr. Graham, I'm so sorry. You were kind enough to invite us to a meal, and now this is happening. Kayla clearly has some issues with me. If it's all right, I'd like to step outside and clear things up with her."



Kayla kept her eyes down, avoiding Jeremy's gaze,her chest tight with unease. She couldn't swallow her anger Amaya and Zoe had been tormenting her grandmother without mercy. How was she supposed to stay quiet about that? Jeremy glanced her way. Her cheeks were flushed,and her fists were clenched at her sides.


This wasn't the quiet, polite woman he was used to seeing. There was fire in her now.


"Your family issues are yours to deal with," he said coolly.


"Thank you, Mr.Graham." Zoe sniffled and gave a tearful smile before standing up and walking over to Kayla. "Kayla, come on. Let's talk outside.We shouldn't ruin Mr. Graham's lunch."



Kayla let out a dry laugh. "Oh, now you care about what's proper? Where's all that energy when you're harassing an old woman?"


"Kayla, don't say things like that. I know we've had our differences, but we're still family."


Zoe glanced sideways, clearly worried that Jeremy might be listening. She moved in closer and reached for Kayla's hand, pretending to be affectionate.


Kayla pulled back sharply, her face twisted in disgust.


"Ah!" Zoe gasped and stumbled, bumping into the edge of the table before falling to the floor in an exaggerated heap, one hand gripping her wrist. "Kayla,I just wanted to talk. How could you push me?" Amaya sprang up from her seat, playing along. Her voice rising "Kaylal That's your sisterl Why are you treating her like this?"


The mother-daughter act was almost impressive-dramatic, perfectly timed, and completely fake.


Kayla stared at them, her eyes hard. She glanced once at Jeremy, who still hadn't said a word. "Starting tomorrow, stay away from my grandmother."


Zoe's eyes filled with tears. She whimperad, "I didn't do anything. Why do you always think the worst of me?"


Kayla scoffed. "Keep pretending. That's what you're best at."



Not wanting to waste more time arguing,she turned and headed for the door.



Just then, a waiter pushed a serving cart into the room As Kayla stepped forward, Zoe subtly stuck out her foot.



Caught off guard, Kayla lost her footing and lurched forward, accidentally toppling the cart and slamming into the edge of the table=only to crash right into the man sitting next to it



Jeremy hadn't seen it ceming The impact knocked him off his chair, and as he hit the floor, his arm dragged  across jagged pieces of a shattered wine bottle


Kayla braced for impact, ready to hit the floor, but instead, she landed against a solid, broad chest that broke her fall. She was stunned for a second.



Then, feeling his breath against her cheek, her heart skipped wildly. Slowly, she lifted her head and looked up-straight into Jeremy's eyes.


"I'm sorry," she mumbled,flustered.


Quickly, she tried to push herself off him by pressing her palm against his chest, but her hand slipped. She lost her balance and fell right back into his arms.


Jeremy let out a low grunt, his arm moving instinctively around her waist to hold her steady.


"Stop moving," he warned.



Kayla froze,too scared to move a muscle.



Across the room, Amaya and Zoe exchanged looks Neither of them had expected things to play out like this.



Zoe's face flushed with jealousy. She clenched her fists at her sides, seething. That should've been her in Jeremy's arms.


"Mr. Graham!" The door swung open. Edwin rushed in,  a group of bodyguards close behind him. They had clearly heard the crash and came in.



They rushed forward, lifting Kayla off him and carefully helping Jeremy back to his feet.


"Mr. Graham, you're hurt!"



Zoe let out an exaggerated gasp and moved forward,but Edwin stepped in and blocked her.


Jeremy's white, custom-fitted shirt was now streaked with red down one sleeve. The wound didn't look small.



Edwin's face tightened with concern. "Mr. Graham,are you okay?"



Jeremy tugged lightly at his sleeve, trying to conceal the stain, then looked toward Kayla. His eyes lingered on her for just a moment.


"I'm fine. Let's go," he said.


With that,Edwin and the bodyguards moved to escort him out. Zoe and Amaya traied close behind.


Kayla didn't move. Her body felt frozen, and her back was damp with cold sweat.



Only after they were gone did she let out a shaky breath and drop heavily into a chair. "What back luck! Why did it have to be him?"



She had not only run into Jeremy but had knocked him down and injured him. What if he held it against her?



Kayla's heart thudded with unease. She was afraid Jeremy might return to hold her accountable


Minutes later, after Jeremy had left, Zoe and Amaya returned.



Amaya didn't bother hiding her anger now. She pointed sharply at Kayla, her voice thick with blame."What is wrong with you? Jeremy invited Zoe and me!Do you have any idea how rare that kind of opportunity is for a family like ours? And you just had to ruin it!"



Kayla lifted her head, her voice sharp. "So you've finally dropped the act, huh? Watching you fake being a caring mother earlier was honestly sickening."



Amaya took a step forward, ready to lash out again



But Zoe grabbed her arm. "Mom, leave it," she said with a dry smile, not bothering to hide her contempt anymore. "She's already offended Jeremy and got him injured.The Graham family won't let this go. Let's just wait and see how she plans to clean up this mess."
###Chapter 11 The First Woman He Had Eveer Been With
 Zoe hadn't been exaggerating-Jeremy getting hurt was no small matter, and once word got out, the entire Graham family would explode.


And when that happened, Kayla knew exactly where the blame would land. They already didn't think much of Liam. There was no chance they'd go easy on her.


Kayla's nerves were fraying. The deal with North Investment was already hanging by a thread, and now she'd managed to offend Jeremy.



She took a deep breath and steadied her nerves. Then she made her way through the hospital corridors toward Jeremy's room.



Edwin stepped in front of her, blocking the doorway the moment he spotted her



Kayla craned her neck, trying to see inside, but the doorway gave away nothing.


She faced Edwin and asked,"How's Jeremy?"


"Still bleeding, thanks to you," Edwin spat, his tone dripping with frustration Kayla swallowed her pride. "I'm sorry," she said sincerely. "Can I see him?"


"You shouldn't. Mr. Graham likely/doesn't want you anywhere near him," Edwin said coolly, planting himself firmly in front of the door.



"Let her in." A low voice cut through the tension



Kayla's breath caught. That voice-so cool, so clear -sent a shiver down her spine.



Edwin peeked inside, clearly displeased, but stepped aside. "You heard him."



The private room was still and spotless. Soft white curtains swayed gently with the breeze, adding a calm,almost delicate air to the space.



Jeremy sat at the edge of the bed, a tray of medical supplies laid out around him.



Kayla had expected to see a nurse attending to him,but to her surprise, the room was quiet-he was completely alone.



His features were sharp and striking, almost too perfect to be real-he had the kind of face that was hard to look away from


"Jeremy?" Kayla spoke up gently. She stayed near the  door, hesitant to step any closer.


Jeremy looked up, his dark eyes steady and unreadable. "Did you come to apologize?" he asked.


"I did," Her voice was soft. "I'm sorry. I never meant to hurt you. I can pay for your medical expenses."


The moment she said it, Kayla scolded herseIf silently What was she even thinking? He was the head of a multinational company and would never be concerned with something as insignificant as hospital fees.


"I don't need your money," he said flatly, brushing off her offer without a second thought


Kayla shifted her weight. "Will your family find out?"


"I'm not a kid. I don't report everything to them,"he muttered, a hint of irritation in his voice as he shot her a quick glance



She nodded, suddenly out of things to say


The silence that followed was sharp-edged



Jeremy dropped his gaze and began wrapping a bandage around his arm, but his fingers moved stffly,the process clearly not going well



The cut from the shattered beer bottle was deeper than she'd thought. Kayla watched in silence for a moment, then, unable to ignore it any longer, offered, "Do you want some help?"



He paused, lifted his gaze, and studied her for a beat.Then he gave a faint nod.


Kayla moved in quietly, taking the bandage from his hand. Carefully, she wrapped the gauze around his arm,trying not to press too hard."Why didn't you call for a nurse?"



"I don't like strangers getting too close."


Her hands paused. Just for a second



Strangers? Did that mean he didn't see her that way?


Jeremy caught the brief flicker of uncertainty in her eyes and seemed to read her thoughts without needing to ask. "You're part of the Graham family."


Relief slipped through her in a soft sigh. She tied the bandage into a tidy knot, then stood up, ready to step back. But as she moved, her lips brushed lightly against the bridge of his nose. The touch was accidental,fleeting, but it jolted the air between them



Their eyes locked. Neither of them spoke



Kayla's heart thudded hard against her ribs, a wild fear  creeping in as she half-wondered if he might lash out at her in the next second.



Had a memory surfaced?



"Liam,why are you here?"


Edwin's voice cut through the silence from just outside the room



Kayla pulled away quickly, letting go of Jeremy's arm and stepping back


Jeremy looked away as well and quietly reached for his suit jacket



Liam walked in, his face tight with concern. His eyes moved quickly to Jeremy, who still looked as distant and composed as ever, and he asked with quiet respect, "Uncle Jeremy, I heard Kayla accidentally injured you. Are you okay?"


As he spoke, Liam's eyes flicked over to Kayla. She turned her head slightly, her face calm-almost detached.



"It's not a big deal," Jeremy said flatly. "Kayla just got caught up in some messy family drama. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time."



Liam nodded, clearly uncomfortable. "Kayla's relationship with her stepmother and sister isn't great  I'm sorry for the trouble. Please don't hold it against her."



A faint smirk pulled at the corner of Jeremy's mouth,though it didn't reach his eyes. "She did come here and apologize sincerely. That's more than enough.I won't make a big deal out of this."


"Glad to hear that. Uncle Jeremy,I'll take Kayla home now." Liam said,reached for her hand, and pulled her along before she could say anything else.



As the door closed behind them, Edwin entered the room. "Mr. Graham, do you think Kayla came here today on purpose? She might be hoping you'll support Liam's company."



Jeremy looked down at the fresh bandage on his arm,his expression tightening as his dark eyes narrowed."Find out everything you can about Kayla."



Edwin hesitated. "Are you trying to stand up for Zoe?"


The sharp look Jeremy shot him was enough to make Edwin drop his head. "Sorry. I crossed the line."


Jeremy slipped a hand into his pocket and pulled out a brooch. He held it up, studying every detail with quiet focus. "And double-check whether the woman from that night was truly Zoe."



"Yes, Mr.Graham." Once Edwin left, Jeremy remained seated, still staring at the brooch. His thoughts drifted back to that night


Even though the room had been dimly lit, he could still picture her eyes-filled with fear and a kind of fragile vulnerability


Her body had been warm and delicate, her breathing light and uneven, making it nearly impossible for him to pull away


She was the first woman he had ever been with
###Chapter 12 She Would Come Back To Him
"What are you doing? Let me go!"


Outside the hospital, Kayla jerked her arm free, her face twisted in disgust. She rubbed her wrist, the spot where Liam's fingers had clamped down still sore with a dull ache



Liam's expression tightened, a flicker of anger breaking through his usually composed face. He hadn't expected her to actually approach Jeremy about the collaboration. Was she really that serious about ending their marriage?


He held back the rising frustration in his chest. "Uncle Jeremy isn't easy to deal with, and you've injured him He's not someone you want as an enemy Just let it go -I'll handle the collaboration. Just stop bringing up the divorce."



Kayla should've felt something-gratitude,maybe-but there was only cold detachment



She raised her head, her voice ice-cold. "I said I'd handle it, and I will. Once it's done, we're getting divorced. I'm sticking to my word, so don't interfere." Liam's eyes narrowed, his voice low with disbelief."And how exactly do you plan on getting him to agree?You went there today and came back empty-handed.If 1, his nephew, couldn't convince him, what makes you think you can?"


Kayla took a step back, brushing him off like a bad memory. "How I do it isn't your concern. You're only desperate to land this project because your company's falling apart. Once it's settled, I want Cooper Group back. Then we're done."


A muscle in Liam's jaw twitched. "Kayla, can't we stop talking about divorce? Isn't there still something left between us?"


"Sorry, but I can't stand being with you anymore."


Liam's patience snapped. He didn't want to keep arguing in front of the hospital. "Let's go home," he said,irritated.


The drive was painfully silent. The tension sat thick between them, neither willing to break it.


The scent of his secretary's perfume drifted through the car,and Kayla's stomach turned.



She rolled the window down,letting in the breeze.The nausea eased. Liam handed her a bottle of water. "I heard about your grandmother being rushed to the ER. I couldn't visit today, but I'll go with you tomorrow."


"There's no need," she replied without looking at him."I'll handle it."



When she didn't take the water, he quietly returned it to the holder He assumed she was just upset about her grandmother and chose not to press her further



"Try not to argue with Zoe and Amaya again I heard they're refusing to help pay for your grandmother's treatment. Don't worry-I'll make sure she gets the care she needs"



She remembered when he promised she'd never be hurt again as long as he was around


But it hadn't taken long, less than a month into the marriage, for him to betray her in the worst way.


All those vows were just lies wrapped in affection



She'd found out about his affair with his secretary not long after they got married. It was then she learned-men's promises couldn't be trusted.


Drained, she leaned against the seat and shut her eyes.



When they pulled into the villa driveway, Liam stepped  out of the car, thinking she had dozed off



He was about to lift her into his arms when his phone rang Pausing, he turned slightly away and answered


"Mr Graham, I'm not feeling well. I'm alone at the hospital Could you come and stay with me?"


The voice was gentle but just loud enough for Kayla to hear.


She opened her eyes, a smirk curlinng at the edge of her lips.


Liam glanced at Kayla before answering in a low voice,"I'm busy. There are doctors at the hospital. If you're not feeling well, see one."


"But I'm really scared_"


Liam ended the call before she could finish. When he turned back, Kayla was already heading toward the villa on her own, not sparing him a glance



Inside, the housekeeper had laid out a light meal The food helped settle the discomfort she'd felt earlier



"Mrs Graham, your appetite's been great lately," the housekeeper said with a warm smile.


Liamn looked over at her, his expression softening just a little. "If you're feeling better, then eat more You've  You need to look after yourself"


"I'm full. I'll be upstairs" Without waiting for a response, Kayla stood and made her way to the staircase



Liam's eyes settled on her empty plate. He couldn't ignore the change-she was eating more lately It was subtle, but noticeable. He used to urge her to eat, but she never paid him any mind.


She was probably exhausted from looking after her grandmother all day and hadn't had a proper meal earlier



Turning to the housekeeper, he said, "From now on,prepare her meals on time. And remind her to eat, no matter how busy she is."



The housekeeper gave a cheerful nod. "Understood,Mr.Graham.You really care about her"





In Liam's mind, no one else could possibly care for Kayla the way he did.





She was just upset-she'd cool down eventually. And when she did, she'd come back to him.





But later that night, around eleven, Liam left the house again.





Another late outing. Most likely to see his secretary Kayla didn't react. She didn't feel angry, or even disappointed anymore Instead, she asked the company staff to send over the project files and spent some time reviewing the details of the collaboration with North Investment.



She was going to find a way to get Jeremy's approval


North Investment was the largest multinational investment group in Trark. For a mid-level company Like Perennia Group, securing a partnership with them was nearly unthinkable


But Liam had one advantage-he was Jeremy's nephew That alone gave him a lead over everyone else.



Kayla wasn't backing down. She went through every detail. After a long night, she finally devised a plan
###Chapter 13 A Deal With Jeremy
 Jeremny had a private villa in Blossom Estate


In the living room, he lounged on the sofa, coffee in hand,his eyes fixed on the woman across from him


"You're going to hand over your shares in Perennia Group to me?" he asked.



Kayla stepped closer, her voice firm but calm. "Yes. If you agree to collaborate with Perennia Group, I'll transfer every share I own to you. You'll become the second-largest shareholder in the company."


This was the plan she'd spent the night putting together



Sleep had been impossible-she'd tossed and turned until morning, waiting for the right moment to come and make her offer in person.



She'd worried she wouldn't be allowed in. It was his home, after all. But the butler had gone to ask, and surprisingly, Jeremy had agreed to see her.



A soft scoff escaped him. Not quite amused-more like he was entertained by her nerve. "Perennia Group is barely a blip. It's not even worth a third of North Investment's value Why would I want your shares?"


"Whether they're valuable or not-you'd know that better than anyone," Kayla answered, her voice laced with careful ambiguity



Jeremy's gaze sharpened, ice replacing the mockery "Does Liam know about this?"



"They're my shares," she said, lifting her chin slightly "I don't need his permission to use them."



"Aren't you two always joined at the hip? Did you fight?"



Kayla pressed her lips into a thin line,clearly unwilling to delve into her private life Without missing a beat,she steered the conversation elsewhere



"I'm sorry about yesterday I made some soup this morning to apologize. I hope you'll accept it."


She placed a thermos on the table



"You made it?" Jeremy raised a brow, suddenly interested



"Yes," Kayla said, her lashes fluttering nervously



Of course she hadn't The housekeeper had prepared the soup that morning,but the moment Kayla caught its scent, her stomach turned. Still, she decided to bring it along-Jeremy wouldn't be able to tell she hadn't made it herself



He didn't say anything,leaving her uncertain. Was he considering the offer? Or just humoring her?


"Mr. Graham, you have a guest," the maid announced.Almost on cue, Zoe appeared in the doorway


Kayla turned to her, eyes narrowing just slightly. Of all times,she had to show up now?


"Mr. Graham!" Zoe's voice rang brightly as she moved straight to him, dressed like she had comne to make an impression. But when her eyes landed on Kayla, her expression soured. "What are you doing here?"



Kayla didn't bother replying. She looked away,unimpressed.



Zoe's face stiffened from the lack of attention and leaned in toward Jeremy. "How's your injury?"


His posture eased a bit. "Much better," he replied.


Zoe lit up, practically beaming. She reached into her bag and set down a thermos too. "I was worried, sSO I made some soup and brought it over. I hope it helps you feel better." Edwin, nearby couldn't help the thought that crossed his mind-the Cooper sisters sure were diligent Both of them, showing up with soup.


Zoe's gaze flicked to the first thermos already on the table. She realized instantly it was from Kayla.



Still smiling, she gently pushed Kayla's thermos to the side and said sweetly. "Oh, Kayla brought soup too?If I'd known you were coming, we could've come together. That way, we wouldn't bother you twice."


Kayla remained quiet, refusing to entertain Zoe's fake friendliness



Still, she couldn't ignore the shift in Jeremy's demeanor whenever Zoe spoke. Did he really think she was the woman from that night?



Before she could dwell on it, a servant entered with a tray of fresh fruit


Zoe immediately offered, "Mr. Graham, let me peel an apple for you."



Jeremy didn't answer, but she picked up an apple and started peeling it anyway. Once done,she handed it to him with both hands



Jeremy wasn't one to eat food others had touched,but he accepted it this time "Thank you." "You're welcome!" Zoe beamed like a child who'd won a prize



She was convinced now-Jeremy liked her Definitely



Eager to prove her magnanimity, she grabbed another apple and held it out toward Kayla "Kayla, would you like one too?"



The scent hit Kayla instantly Her stomach turned. She quickly covered her mouth, turning her face to the side,quietly gagging


Jeremy noticed His eyes flicked up to her, watching carefully


Zoe's reaction was immediate and dramatic. "Kayla,are you pregnant?"



Kayla's heart skipped a beat, but she didn't flinch Instead, she replied calmly, "I've had a few stomach issues lately. I'm on medication. But, Zoe, you've never shown much concern for me before. Why now?"


The smile on Zoe's face cracked. She turned quickly to Jeremy,hoping he'd say something,maybe defend her



But he simply said, "You should leave. We still have matters to discuss"
Zoe stood frozen for a beat, then forced a tight smile "Alright. I'll visit you again soon."


As she walked past Kayla, she shot her a sharp glare before disappearing out the door


With the room quiet again, Kayla turned back to Jeremy. "I've already passed the project files to your assistant. It's a real estate venture-its value will only go up. If you decide to move forward, it'll be a strong strategic play I hope you'll consider it. And if you change your mind, you can reach out anytime."



Jeremy didn't respond, and Kayla knew staying any longer would be pointless.



She gave a small nod, then turned and walked out



The cool air hit her the moment she stepped outside,and she finally let herself exhale.



Coming here had been a risk. She didn't know if Jeremy would see the value in her offer



Though her marriage to Liam had been brief, she'd picked up enough during Graham family gatherings to piece together a few unsettling truths



Jeremy's mother had died, and all the whispers all pointed to Janiya Graham-Liam's mother Janiya was Johnny's illegitimate daughter Years ago,Johnny's affair had driven Jeremy's mother to the brink She fell ill and eventually died Later, Johnny brought Janiya home



Jeremy had never forgiven that Janiya had spent years trying to push Liam back into the family business,maneuvering to give him a top seat in Graham Group


Jeremy wouldn't let it happen. If anything, he was likely working to dismantle her plans-starting with Liam's Perennia Group



Kayla had connected the dots just last night. That was when she made her decision



Her shares, backed by the fact that she'd funded most of Perennia's early development, made up a full third of the company



Now, the choice rested with Jeremy



As Kayla stepped off the front steps, she stopped short. Zoe was waiting for her outside
###Chapter 14 She's Got Some Fire In Her
Zoe stomped forward, her face twisted with rage "Kayla,what were you doing in Jeremy's house?"


Kayla held her gaze, unfazed. "And why exactly can't I be here? This place doesn't belong to you."



Zoe let out a mocking snort "You're Liam's wife Hovering around his uncle? Completely out of line.You should really keep your distance"



Kayla gave a quiet laugh "Wow. Giving orders like that? Maybe try actually becoming Jeremy's wife before acting the part Right now, it's a bit too early for that"



Zoe's face flushed, her embarrassment quickly morphing into smugness "Let me guess You offended Jeremy, and your husband sent you to clean up the mess? Makes sense He's not exactly loved by the Graham family If Jeremy's patience runs out, you both could be cut off for good"



Kayla stayed silent.



Zoe went on, her tone sharp with contempt "You and that worthless husband of yours really do suit each other"



There was a time when Kayla would have exploded at anyone insulting Liam and wouldn't have held back with Zoe But now? She didn't care Zoe could talk all she wanted.



With a dramatic toss of her hair, Zoe turned to walk away,her heels clicking with every step.



A faint, mocking smile played on Kayla's lips. Just as Zoe walked by, Kayla casually slipped her foot out in her path.



"Ah!"



Zoe toppled forward and landed flat on her face with a loud,graceless thud



Moments ago, she looked every bit the polished socialite. Now, she was sprawled on the floor,humiliated.



Kayla covered her mouth to hold back a laugh. "Oops.Careful-wouldn't want something artificial falling out."


Zoe clutched her chest, her face red with fury as she looked up. "You're unbelievable!"



Kayla tilted her head slightly "Yesterday, when you tripped me, that was pretty unbelievable too. Think of this as a payback." Fuming, Zoe hurried to her feet, her hair tangled and wild, and charged at Kayla, shaking with fury


Kayla stepped aside effortlessly, and Zoe lost her balance again, nearly going down a second time



"Next time you feel like starting something, Zoe,make sure you're up for it. Know your place."


Without waiting for a response, Kayla turned and walked away.



"Kayla!"



Zoe stood frozen,her chest rising and falling sharply,her face flushed with rage.



The butler had seen everything. He turned around and went back into the villa.



Jeremy sat quietly in the living room,lost in thought since Kayla had walked out


Edwin finally spoke up, unable to stay quiet. "Mr Graham, if you're aiming for Perennia Group, why not just buy the whole thing? Why bother with share negotiations?"



Jeremy gave a light shrug, his voice casual.′′An outright takeover would be too dull. And the way Kayla linked me to Liam's mother? It shows she's  serious about locking down this project, regardless of Liam's opinion."


Edwin looked uncertain. "But they're married. Isn't her behavior a little off?"



"If their marriage is already crumbling,then what she's doing adds up."


Edwin's brows furrowed into a frown."But the wedding was just recent. How did things go downhill so fast?"


Jeremy glanced up, his voice suddenly cold. "What's the latest on Kayla's background?"



Edwin got straight to the point. "Kayla moved out of her father's place a long time ago. After her mother died,her father,Damon Cooper,married his mistress.Since then, Kayla hasn't gotten along with them.That's what led to the argument yesterday. Also, I found out that she and Liam are in the middle of a divorce."



Jeremy lifted his cup and took a slow sip, saying nothing.



Edwin continued, "It seems Kayla found out that Liam's a little too close to his secretary. That's what pushed her to file for divorce."



Jeremy placed his cup down and said casually,"Forget about Kayla for now. What did you find out  about the other thing I asked you to look into?"


"Zoe was indeed at the hotel that night. The brooch you found? It's hers. The Cooper family staff said Damon gifted her two identical ones years ago. That confirms it-she's the woman who was in your room that night."



Jeremy nodded slowly."Got it."


If she had been with him that night, then he'd have to take responsibility for what happened


"Mr. Graham." The butler stepped in. "Kayla and Zoe ran into each other outside. Things got a little tense,and Kayla ended up tripping Zoe."



Jeremy let out a dry laugh. "She's got some fire in her."
###Chapter 15 Are You Going Ahead With It
Days passed, and Kayla still hadn't received any word from Jeremy


Her anxiety growing, she went straight to North Investment But the receptionist told her she couldn't see Jeremy without an appointment


Feeling the pressure mount in her chest, Kayla leaned forward slightly and said pleadingly, "Please, I just need a few minutes with Mr. Graham. It's urgent."


The receptionist gave Kayla a dismissive look, her tone laced with sarcasm "Plenty of people want to meet Mr. Graham You're just another one of them. If I let everyone through, I'd get fired."



Kayla's face tightened at the receptionist's obvious mockery


Still, knowing she was on their turf, she held back her words



The receptionist flicked her hair back smugly and said,"If you're not leaving, I'll have security escort you out."


"Kayla?" a familiar voice called out from behind. Kayla spun around. Relief swept over her face when she saw Jeremy's assistant approaching."Edwin!"


Edwin gave the receptionist a sharp look. She quickly dropped her gaze, realizing she'd messed up.


Then he turned to Kayla with a polite smile. "You're here to see Mr. Graham, aren't you?"


She gave a small nod. "Yes. Is he available now?"


"He's in a meeting at the moment. You might need to wait a bit," Edwin explained as he led her towards the elevators.



The receptionist watched them go, regret heavy in her chest. "She really is one of Mr. Graham's important guests."


While Jeremy remained in his meeting, Edwin showed Kayla to the lounge.


As she sat on the velvet sofa, Kayla tried to calm herself. The richness of the room only made her more restless. She glanced around, her fingers twisting nervously in her lap.


A secretary stepped in holding a tray. "Ma'am, here's some coffee."



"Thank you." Kayla reached for the cup. But the secretary's hand shook and the coffee sloshed over the rim, splashing onto Kayla's white blouse



The secretary gasped and quickly said, "I'm really sorry!Are you okay?"



Kayla stood, gently blotting the stain on her blouse with a tissue "It's alright."



"I'm so sorry," the secretary said over and over again,her face full of remorse as she tried to help clean it up



Kayla stayed focused on her blouse, unaware that someone had entered.



Jeremy stood silently at the doorway,his eyes fixed on her. Something stirred in his chest as he watched her



His thoughts drifted to that night-foggy,intense-and the shadowy memory of a woman with messy hair and a face he couldn't fully remember.



He kept staring, caught in the moment


Kayla turned and saw him, startled. She quickly moved her hand to cover the damp spot on her blouse."Have you finished your meeting?"



The coffee had soaked through, making the outline of her black bra just visible beneath the white fabric. Jeremy blinked, suddenly pulled back to the present.His eyes accidentally dropped to the damp spot on her blouse, and a wave of heat crept up his neck. He quickly looked away, his face giving nothing away



Keeping his composure, he stepped further into the room and said, "Edwin said you were looking for me What's the matter?"



"I wanted to follow up," she said carefully. "Have you given any thought to what I proposed the other day?"


Jeremy sat down across from her,legs crossed neatly.His tone was detached. "I haven't decided yet."



Kayla tried to stay composed. "Perennia Group is running out of time. I hope you understand how serious this is."



"You can go. I'll take care of it when it's appropriate,"Jeremy replied coldly



"But..." Kayla opened her mouth to argue, but Jeremy stood up and walked out before she could say another word.



A moment later, Edwin entered. "You should head back for now. Mr. Graham will give you an answer Soon."



He offered her a jacket, gesturing subtly at her blouse But Kayla gave a small smile and shook her head"No need Thank you."



With nothing left to say, she walked out



Back in the CEO's office,Edwin placed the untouched jacket on a nearby chair "She's gone."


Jeremy's eyes landed on the jacket for a moment,then drifted toward the memory of her standng in that lounge-damp blouse, flustered expression.Something about her tugged at the past



Given that Kayla and Zoe were sisters, the resemblance made sense



But even so, a doubt gnawed at him. Something didn't add up


Jeremy sat dowvn at his desk and gave an order. "Send her a message. Tell her to bring the contract here tomorrow"



Edwin hesitated. "Are you going ahead with it?"
###Chapter 16 You're Not Staying H ere Tonight
Kayla chose to stay the night at the care facility so she could take better care of her grandmother,Marsha Carpenter.



The caregiver had already cleaned the room.


Not long after, Liam arrived with a bag of toiletries.


As she chatted with Marsha, Kayla noticed and frowned. "I'm the one staying tonight, not you. Take your things and leave."


Liam didn't flinch. His face was serious. "I can't let you stay here alone. I'll stay too. Marsha will like that."


Marsha, still on the bed, nodded with a wide smile.



But Kayla didn't back down. "That won't be necessary.I'll stay with Grandma. You should go."


Liam pulled her into the hallway with her and said firmly, "Marsha told me today she wants us to get along.Her health just improved. You wouldn't want to stress her out, would you?"



Kayla yanked her arm away with a cold expression  "Who gave you the right to tell me what to do?"


"We're married. I'm your husband. Just don't make her worry.okay?"



"Let's see how long you can keep this act going."



Kayla shoved the door open and walked back into the room


Liam stood there watching her. He was sure that as long as Marsha was around, Kayla wouldn't dare bring up the divorce



Inside, Marsha had heard the commotion from the hallway



When Kayla came back in, Marsha asked gently,"Kayla.did you and Liam argue just now?"



Kayla sat beside her and tucked the blanket up to her shoulders. "No, Grandma. Don't think too much. Just get some rest."



Marsha let out a soft sigh"I've watched the two of you for so many years. You've always cared about each other. Now that you're married,you need to hold onto that. Don't let little things get in the way."



"|know."



Kayla didn't want to trouble Marsha with the truth,not  now So she stayed quiet about her plan to end the marriage


Marsha gently patted her hand "Liam's a good man.I know he'll treat you well You should think about starting a family while you're young and strong. His company's doing well, and your life will only keep getting better I just want to see you happy, Kayla"


She spoke from the heart, still holding Kayla's hand,until her eyelids grew heavy and she fell asleep


Kayla sat silently beside her, not saying a word She couldn't bring herself to respond to Marsha's wishes


She would wait until the divorce was final before telling Marsha the truth



When Kayla stepped into the hallway, she wasn't surprised to find Liam still there



"Marsha's asleep? Then let's rest too." He reached out to take her hand and lead her back inside.



But Kayla stood still



Liam turned to face her, his tone growing tight, "Kayla,the doctor said Marsha can't handle any emotional shocks right now."



Kayla suddenly said, "I'm hungry." Liam paused for a second, then smiled "Okay. I'll get someone to bring you something."



"No.I want you to go get it yourself"



"It's late. I'd rather stay with you."


Kayla glared at him with clear impatience. "Are you going or not?"



"Alright, I'll go!" Liam gave in, grabbing his coat and heading for the door



As soon as he stepped outside, Kayla pushed the door fully shut behind him and locked it with a loud bang



Liam turned quickly, realizing too late what had happened. "Kaylal What are you doing? Open the door!"



"Go home,Liam. You're not staying here tonight!"



Kayla didn't answer again. Instead,she lay down on the bed,exhausted.



At once, a wave of nausea rolled through her. She sat up quickly, rushed to the bathroom, and leaned over the sink,retching hard, though nothing came up



She grabbed a handful of tissues and sat down on the toilet,breathing heavily One hand moved instinctively to her lower belly She was pregnant That was a fact she could no longer ignore



She knew she needed to divorce Liam as soon as possible and take her grandmother far away from all of this



Once her belly started to show, everything would spiral out of control.



And then there was Jeremy, that cold and arrogant man For the sake of Perennia Group, she had to stay close to him, but he could never find out about the baby



Feeling drained and uneasy, Kayla lay back on the bed Just then, her phone buzzed with a new email



It was from North Investment Jeremy's secretary had invited her to the office the next day



Kayla's heart skipped a beat Did this mean he had agreed to work with Perennia Group?
###Chapter 17 The Same Ring


Kayla was so thrilled she couldn't sleep all night. As soon as morning broke, she hurried to North Investment.



But the moment she arrived, she was told that Jeremy had a packed schedule that day and was currently in a meeting, so she'd have to wait.


"Ma'am, please wait here for now. Mr. Graham will meet with you once he's out of his meeting," the secretary said, guiding her into a lounge.


"Alright. Thank you."


Left alone in the spacious, empty room, Kayla sat stiffly on the couch, her hands gripping the folder in her lap.


A long time passed, and she felt tempted to barge into the meeting room, drop the contract in front of Jeremy,and ask him to sign it right then and there.



Suddenly, there was shouting from the next room.


At first, Kayla ignored it. But when she heard a woman scream, something inside her snapped to attention.



She stood up and stepped outside. Next door, a woman was crouched on the floor,completely frantic. A little boy, barely three years old,lay beside her His face had turned a sickly shade of blue, his small limbs jerking uncontrollably



The woman cried out his name, sobbing as she tried to rouse him



The secretary rushed in, took one look, and ran to call for the doctor.



Kayla's eyes dropped to the floor. Bits of hard candy scattered beside the boy's hand. He must have choked on it



"Mrs. Campbell, the doctor is on his way!" the secretary said, panting, as she rushed back in.



"There's no time! Let me try!" Kayla stepped into the room without hesitation



The woman, Kelley Campbell, grabbed her arm in panic. "What are you doing to my child?" The wariness in her eyes was clear



"Your son's choking I have to perform first aid on him now,or he could stop breathing before the doctor gets here!" Kayla said quickly, her voice firm and urgent



Kelley froze, her hands trembling. She looked down at her son, then stepped aside


Every second mattered, and Kayla didn't hesitate. She jumped into action.



She gently lifted the child into a standing position,moved behind him, and wrapped her arms tightly around his small waist. Pressing one fist just above his belly button, she placed her other hand over it and pulled sharply


She didn't stop She kept going, about one thrust each second.



Kelley stood frozen, eyes wide with fear, her chest tight as she silently begged for her son to be okay


Kayla focused hard, watching for any sign of change -and then she saw it. The boy's face,though still pale,began to regain some color.


Finally, the child gagged, and suddenly a piece of candy shot out of his mouth.



The little boy burst out crying, the paleness in his face fading slowly



Kelley gasped and dropped to her knees, hugging him tightly,sobbing



Kayla stepped back, breathing heavily, and shook out her aching hands. A moment later, the doctor arrived. He checked the boy thoroughly and confirmed he was fine



"This young woman performed the Heimlich maneuver perfectly She saved his life. If she hadn't acted when she did, we could have lost him."


Kelley turned to Kayla with tears in her eyes. "Thank you. Thank you so much for saving my baby."


"It's okay," Kayla said softly


But Kelley couldn't stop repeating it. "Thank you.."Her knees buckled, and she started to collapse



Kayla rushed forward to catch her "Are you alright?"



"What's happening here?" The door flew open, and a tall man stepped in, his face full of worry



Kayla turned and saw Jeremy enter right behind him,along with a few assistants.


Jeremy looked surprised to see Kayla. His eyes quickly moved from her to Kelley and the child on the floor,putting the pieces together without a word.



The man who had rushed in was Kelley's husband,Zane Campbell, the CEO of a multinational corporation currently in negotiations with North Investment "Honey, our son choked on candy, but this young woman saved him."


Zane turned to Kayla and nodded gently. "Thank you."


"It was nothing, really." Kayla said with a polite smile



Jeremy stepped in. "I'll have them taken back to the hotel so they can rest. I'll also arrange for a full medical exam."



Zane nodded. "Good idea."


As Kelley was escorted out, she held tightly to Kayla's hand, whispering more thanks as she left.


Zane lingered a moment longer, his eyes settling back on Kayla. "Jeremy, is she one of your employees?"


Jeremy's reply was calm. "No."



Zane looked curious. "Then why is she here at North Investment?"



It was clear to Kayla that Zane held a lot of weight in Jeremy's business world. The way his assistants moved around him said enough



She took a step forward and spoke up. "Mr Campbell,I'm Kayla. Mr. Graham is my husband's uncle."



She didn't really know how else to describe her  connection to Jeremy.



She wasn't one of his employees, and calling him a friend didn't feel right either If she didn't explain things clearly, it might cause confusion.



Jeremy gave her a deep look but didn't correct her.


Zane chuckled. "Ah, I see. So you're family. Jeremy,looks like I owe you two a favor"


Jeremy responded smoothly, "There's no need for that."



Later, in the CEO's office, Kayla stood in front of Jeremy's desk. Her eyes were fixed on the ring in her hand-a striking green stone,which looked clearly too large for her fingers.



"| can't believe Zane gave this to you. You really had some luck today."



Kayla glanced up at the man sitting across from her.That was when she noticed he was wearing a green ring exactly like the one she was holding.
###Chapter 18 Her Perfume



Jeremy tapped his fingers lightly against the tabletop,his expression cold and detached



"When Zane and I first expanded business overseas,we designed these pair of rings together It became a symbol of our partnership. Today,you saved his son Giving you that ring was his way of saying thank you."



Kayla held up the ring and twirled it between her fingers with a smile. "Well, I guess today is my lucky day Who would have thought I'd end up wearing the same ring as you?"



Jeremy stared at her in silence.



The humor in Kayla's voice dimmed. She lowered the ring and cleared her throat. "Anyway, let's talk business What's your opinion on my proposal?"


Jeremy's tone was cold. "You're smart, but I don't like people trying to bargain with me."



Kayla gave a soft laugh. "Is that a no?"


He stayed silent, his sharp gaze locked on her, steady and intense



A cold shiver crawled down Kayla's back. She looked away,her eyes darting to the side, too uneasy to hold his stare



Then Jeremy leaned back in his leather chair,his tone suddenly casual but pointed. "Every time you see me,you look nervous. Or like you've done something wrong. Mind telling me why?"


Kayla forced a light chuckle. "you're kind of a big deal Someone like me is bound to feel a little intimidated You probably don't even realize the pressure you bring with you."



"You're not being honest."



"|am."



Jeremy rested his head on one hand, his every move smooth and controlled, giving off the kind of presence that filled a room without trying



"Are you here on behalf of Perennia Group for yourself or for Liam?"



Kayla tilted her head. "Does it matter? I co-founded it with him. It's as much mine as it is his."



"Mr. Graham." Edwin walked in just then with a document in hand. "Mr. Campbell has agreed to move forward with the partnership next quarter Here's the signed contract."
 Jeremy took it and skimmed the pages



He had known Zane for a long time and understood how he operated-sharp-minded and always chasing profit. He hadn't planned on renewing their deal for the next quarter, which had been weighing on Jeremy's mind. But now, out of the blue, Zane had signed without the slightest pushback, and that caught Jeremy off guard.



Jeremy raised his eyes and gave Kayla a long.deliberate look.



She raised her brows with a playful smile. "Did Mr Campbell sign because I saved his kid?"



"You're clever, but don't try to use that cleverness on me," Jeremy said flatly as he dropped the contract onto the table.



"It wasn't on purpose. I had no idea who that boy's father was. I just did what anyone should've done."Her wide eyes and soft voice gave off a harmless energy.



But Jeremy wasn't buying it. She wasn't naive. She knew how to play the part well enough to disarm anyone.



"You brought your own contract, didn't you?" he asked "Yes!"



Kayla snapped back to attention, quickly digging into her bag She pulled out the folder and placed it on the desk in front of him with both hands, maintaining a calm expression despite the excitement bubbling inside.



Jeremy opened the folder and began flipping through His long fingers glided smoothly across the paper as he read



Kayla stood quietly beside him, but her eyes kept drifting. His lashes were dark and thick, shadowing his eyes His jaw was sharp, his skin clear, and his perfectly shaped lips looked both handsome and distant



This man was truly a masterpiece



Kayla couldn't help but stare, enthralled and lost



"Did you draft this yourself?" Jeremy asked When there was no response, he glanced and caught her staring



Their eyes locked, and for a split second, it felt like a spark jumped between them A chill ran down both their spines



"Sorry, what did you say?" Kayla stammered, flustered What a daydreamer she was!


Jeremy narrowed his eyes "I asked if you wrote this contract yourself Does Liam know about it?"


"This is my decision I'm the one leading this project,"Kayla replied,regaining her composure. She leaned in to point at a section in the document, bringing herself closer to him



As she moved, a soft, floral scent drifted across the table It caught Jeremy off guard. His fingers froze against the page



That scent-warm and familiar-wrapped around him like a quiet whisper. It stirred something strange in his chest



He didn't understand why it affected him so much


Kayla pointed at a clause. "As I said earlier, I'll transfer my shares to you. It's all in here. Once you sign,I'll inform the legal team. And don't worry-I'm not using what happened with Mr. Campbell's son to ask forany favors."



"Who said you could stand that close?" Jeremy's voice was low and intimidating



Kayla immediately stepped back "I just wanted to make sure you could  see the clause clearly." "I can see just fine."



Jeremy straightened his tie, picked up the pen beside him, and signed the document with a smooth, steady hand.



Kayla watched every stroke of his signature, trying hard to contain her excitement. Her fingers curled tightly around the hem of her dress.



When he finished, Jeremy slid the contract across the table. "You can go."



"Got it." She quickly gathered the papers and turned to leave, acting quite nervous.


Even after the door closed behind her, the faint trace of her perfume lingered in the air.



Jeremy sat back in his chair, tugged at his tie again,and huffed in irritation. He pulled out a cigarette, lit it,and took a long drag, trying to push away the heat crawling under his skin.
###Chapter 19 Grandma,Where Did You Go
The entire day had slipped by while Kayla was tied up with contract details and legal paperwork involving Jeremy and the transfer of company shares.


In all that chaos, she hadn't even noticed her phone had powered off.



Meanwhile,Liam,growing increasingly anxious from the radio silence, decided to head straight to the care facility.



Marsha was in the middle of her therapy session A caregiver was seated beside her,keeping her company with light conversation.



Stepping in quietly, Liam carried a few shopping bags filled with supplements and set them on the nearby table.



The caregiver stood up quickly and gave him a polite nod. "Mr. Graham."



"Has Marsha been alright today?" asked Liam, offering a brief nod in return.



"She was a bit out of sorts earlier, but she's been  mostly clear-headed since then."


"You can go ahead and take a break. I'll sit with her for a while."



"Of course." With that, the caregiver gave a slight bow and left the room



Easing into the chair beside Marsha, Liam reached out and smoothed her hair with a gentle touch. "Kayla didn't make it today. I wonder what's keeping her so tied up"



Marsha gradually shifted her gaze, the faint cloudiness in her aging eyes betraying a flicker of uncertainty "Liam, has Kayla gone back to work lately?"



Liam shook his head "She's been out of the company for a while now I've told her to just rest at home. No point wearing herself out."



"That's a relief to hear." Marsha's lips curved into a soft smile. "Knowing you're handling things makes me feel at peace"



With a quiet sigh, Liam let his hand fall into hislap."She hasn't been herself lately. Talks about divorce have come up."



Marsha's body stiffened as her fingers clutched his."Divorce? Why would she say that?" He tightened his grip around her hand, his face set with quiet determination. "You don't have to worry.1won't let things go that far She's just been cooped up too long, overthinking everything Once her spirits lift,talk of divorce will be the last thing on her mind."



Though still tense, Marsha's shoulders relaxed slightly "You've been doing your best, Liam Kayla's lucky she has someone like you."



To lift her spirits, Liam suggested they go out for a bit He personally helped her into the car and drove them to a nearby park.



The afternoon sun poured across the walkways, and the park buzzed with quiet joy-elderly couples playing chess, small groups stretching, others simply sitting and enjoying the breeze



The breeze rustled gently through the trees as Marsha sat on a park bench, her face lit up with quiet joy while she took in the scene around her



Not far from her, Liam remained close. His tall build and sharp features didn't go unnoticed by a group of elderly women seated nearby



One of them leaned toward Marsha with a grin "You're blessed to have such a handsome and attentive grandson." With a proud chuckle, Marsha corrected her,saying "Oh no, he's not my grandson. He's married to my granddaughter"



The compliment clearly touched her, and a warm glow spread across her face



Liam continued to play his part with care, keeping a watchful eye on her and gently settling his jacket over her shoulders when the wind picked up



A sudden vibration broke the moment-his phone buzzing from his coat pocket



Curious, he pulled it out and checked the screen Tricia's name flashed across the display With a quick glance toward Marsha, he stepped aside to take the call



"What is it?"



"I slipped while getting out of the shower," Tricia said,her voice trembling "The floor was wet, and I've been lying here. I'm scared. Can you come?"



A crease formed between Liamn's brows "I'm not home right now. This isn't really a good time."



"But I'm alone, and I can't even stand up Please,I need help I don't know what else to do." Tears in her voice made the plea sound even more desperate



He didn't hesitate much longer "Alright I'm on my way"


Liam thought he'd get her to the hospital and be back before long



He made his way back to the bench and leaned toward Marsha "Something came up I need to run an errand real quick Just stay here, alright?"



Lost in the rhythm of a group of dancers nearby,Marsha only half-heard him and nodded without turning away



A moment later, Liam's car rolled out of the parking lot





Meanwhile,Kayla had just wrapped up her errands, her stomach already rumbling. Hunger gnawed at her, and she stopped at the nearest restaurant to eat before the nausea hit again



If she skipped another meal, she knew the queasiness would come back full force



Right after she paid the bill and prepared to head home, her phone lit up with a call. It was the care facility "Kayla,your grandmother is missing We can't find her anywherel"



Shock gripped Kayla like ice Her body wouldn't move Her mind emptied out in an instant Fingers tightening around her phone, she blurted out, "What do you mean she's missing? How does someone just vanish?"



"Your husband left the facility with her earlier They haven't come back, and now we can't find either of them"



"Got it. I'll handle it"



Without wasting a second, she tried calling Liam But it went to his voice mail



According to the staff, the last ping from Marsha's tracking device showed her somewhere in a nearby public park



Throwing herself into a cab, Kayla kept stabbing at Liam's number the entire ride there, but no one answered



"If anything happens to Grandma,Liam, I swear l'll never let you off the hook," she muttered through clenched teeth, her voice sharp with rage and fear



The park was still lively with people The staff met her near the entrance. After a quick rundown, they split  into teams and began sweeping the area for any sign of Marsha.



Minutes dragged into nearly an hour. Still nothing


Kayla's chest tightened with every fruitless step. Her hands trembled. Her throat burned. Liam hadn't answered at all.



In a final act of desperation, she phoned her father. It was Amaya who picked up.



"What do you expect us to do? We already told you -whatever happens to Marsha has nothing to do with us. She's not our problem. Don't call again," Amaya snapped before hanging up.



That heartless response made Kayla's skin crawl. She pictured Marsha alone somewhere, scared and vulnerable.



Hope crumbling, she began stopping strangers at random, holding up her phone with Marsha's photo."Have you seen her? Please, just look. She's missing."



Most didn't even glance twice. One woman shrugged Another shook her head. "Sorry, haven't seen anyone like that."



Her breath hitched. "Grandma, where did you go?Please be okay.Please come back." Tears clouding her vision, she stepped off the sidewalk without looking



Suddenly,tires screeched across the pavement



A luxury sedan, sleek and black, slammed its brakes just in time. The headlights blasted over her like a spotlight
###Chapter 20 Please Help Me Find Her
Kayla lifted her hand to block the glare of the oncoming headlights. The car came to a sudden stop just a few feet away,barely missing her.


The window rolled down, and the driver leaned out,surprise written across his face.



She lowered her hand and looked up-just in time to see the rear window slowly sliding down



Inside sat a man, upright and composed, with an air of cold authority.


"Jeremy?" Kayla went stiff for a moment, then quickly ran up to the car.



Jeremy's face darkened, and he growled, "Are you trying to get yourself killed?"



She had walked right into traffic. With cars whizzing past, it was like she didn't even care about her safety.



But Kayla didn't have time to respond to his scolding.As she gripped the car window with both hands,her eyes shimmered with tears. Before she could get a word out, Jeremy frowned "What happened? Why do you look like this?"


"My grandma is missing Please help me find her,"Kayla said,her voice shaky and tight with panic.


Jeremy had power and reach across all of Trark. If anyone could help, it was him


"I'm begging you. Please help me find her." She couldn't stop herself from begging, her voice shaking with desperation


Jeremy didn't hesitate. He pulled out his phone and made a call "I need to find someone... Now"


The voice on the other end responded immediately



Jeremy pushed open the car door, ready to let her in,but before she could move, Kayla suddenly swayed and collapsed


He caught her just in time, his arm wrapping around her waist as her knees buckled



"Kaylal"



Her face had gone pale, her eyes shut tight


Without a second thought, he lifted her into the car and ordered the driver, "To the hospital. Now." At the hospital, the faint sting of disinfectant and rubbing alcohol pulled Kayla from unconsciousness Sensitive to the sharp scent, she stirred awake in a rush.



As her eyes fluttered open, she saw a doctor walking over with a stethoscope, about to begin an exam.



Frantic, Kayla jerked back and pushed him away before quickly sitting up. "'I'm fine!"



The doctor stumbled slightly, caught off guard by her reaction.



Jeremy stepped forward, his voice firm and calm. "Lie down."



Kayla's heart pounded as she clutched the edge of her dress. "I'm okay. I just felt a bit lightheaded earlier.That's all."



She couldn't risk a checkup. If they examined her,they'd find out she was pregnant-and that couldn't happen.


Jeremy wasn't moved. "You're already here. Just get examined properly."


"No need, really. I feel better now." Gathering what little courage she had, Kayla stepped toward him and grabbed his arm, trying to pull him toward the door. "Please. Let's go find my grandma. We're wasting time "


Jeremy looked at her calmly. "Your grandma's already been found."



"What?" She froze, her grip tightening on his arm without thinking



Jeremy glanced down at her hand. "How long are you planning to cling to me?"



"Sorry, I didn't mean to!" Kayla muttered, flustered,and quickly let go. "Where is my grandma now?"


Jeremy adjusted his sleeve, smoothing out the creases, then replied casually, "She was found outside a market. My people already sent her back to the care facility."



Relieved, Kayla exhaled slowly. Her eyes shimmered with gratitude as she looked up at him. "Thank you SO much."



"Just repaying the favor. You did save Zane's kid."


Without waiting for a reply, he turned and walked off with his assistant.



Kayla stared at his back as he walked away, still frozen in place, lost in a daze she couldn't shake.
###Chapter 21 I'm Not Letting Her Leave Me


Inside the care facility, Marsha ate in her room. Across from her, the caregiver was keeping her company.

Kayla stood at the doorway, her eyes fixed on her grandmother. Waves of grief washed over her, heavy and unrelenting.

If Jeremy hadn't stepped in tonight, she didn't know what would have happened to her grandmother.

Lately, Marsha drifted in and out, her thoughts wandering off like loose balloons, sometimes disappearing completely.

"Kayla!" A burst of footsteps echoed down the hall, and Liam burst through the doorway, his chest heaving and worry etched deep into his face. "I'm so sorry. Something urgent pulled me away. I never imagined Marsha would leave the park while I was gone."

Without warning, Kayla's palm cracked across his cheek. The sting was immediate and sharp.

As the heat spread across his face, Liam flinched, stunned by the force of her anger.

With her hand still trembling, Kayla glared at him. "Liam, this is it. I can't do this anymore. It's over between us."
Redness bloomed on his cheek as Liam faced her, desperation clinging to his words. "Kayla, please. I knowl let you down, but I promise I won't take my eyes off Marsha again. Just give me one more chance."

Kayla's voice was ice-cold. "Admit it. You left my grandmother alone because you wanted to be with Tricia. If you want her so badly, just end our marriage and get it over with. Nothing's stopping you."

A frantic shake of his head accompanied'Liam's plea. "No, you've got it wrong. There's nothing between me and Tricia. I only care about you. You're my wife."

"Enough!" Kayla stormed across the room, grabbed a stack of papers, and hurled them at him. "Jeremy signed the contract. You made a promise-once I landed this contract, we'd end it." Paralyzed,Liam stood motionless, the reality sinking in like a cold wave.

He stared down at the contract lying on the floor, watching his marriage unravel in front of him.

A hard finality colored Kayla's tone. "Tomorrow at nine, the courthouse. That's when we finish this."

Shock drained the color from Liam's cheeks as his hands tightened into fists.

No part of him had truly believed that Kayla would manage to win Jeremy's approval for the project.

Releasing his grip, Liam stooped to retrieve the contract. A bitter smile crossed his face. "Alright, tomorrow it is."

Something about Liam's reaction made Kayla pause, though she was relieved that he hadn't put up a fight about the divorce.

Without looking back, she walked away, retreating into the room and shutting the door behind her.

Rage took over, and Liam's knuckles whitened around the contract. One harsh swing sent the papers flying.

From the hallway, Tricia stepped in and picked up the scattered contract with careful hands. "Why wreck this? This is our lifeline. The company needs this partnership, whether you like it or not."

A glare colder than steel shot from Liam's eyes.

Tricia offered an innocent shrug. "Why are you looking at me like that? Kayla's made up her mind. You can't stop her from walking away."

"Divorce isn't happening!" Liam shouted, shoving past her, fury pulsing in every stride.

A dark scowl clouded Tricia's face as she hurried after him.

Wasting no time, Kayla returned home, intent on packing her things and moving on.

Near the closet, the maid lingered, watching as Kayla folded her clothes, worry etched across her brow."Ma'am, where are you going?"

"I'm divorcing Liam. I won't be calling this place home anymore," said Kayla, her tone resolute. Uncertainty flickered in the maid's eyes as Kayla shoved her belongings into a suitcase.

Liam rushed back after the maid's call. He found Kayla halfway down the stairs, suitcase in hand. "Kayla,just stop."

Kayla squared her shoulders and met his gaze. "I'm leaving now, Liam. We're finished. Don't come after me again."

Redness rimmed Liam's eyes as he seized her shoulders. "You're ending everything we've built with just a few words? Kayla, is your heart really that cold?"

A flash of revulsion crossed Kayla's face as she shoved his hands aside. "If anyone's heartless, it's you. Get out of my way."

Blocking her path, Liam clamped down on the suitcase. "You're not going anywhere,Kayla."

"Let go of me," she snapped, tugging at the handle.

Liam's voice rose with frustration. "I said, you're staying right here!"

Their tug-of-war sent one of Kayla's belongings-a ring-clattering to the floor.

Faster than Kayla could reách it, Liam scooped up the ring and turned it over in his fingers.

Suspicion darkened Liam's face as his gaze darted from the ring to Kayla."Where did you get Uncle Jeremy's ring? What are you hiding from me?"

"Hand it over!"

Kayla lunged for the ring. Instead of backing down, Liam grabbed the collar of her shirt, holding her in place.

A bitter accusation tumbled from his lips. "Did you really cozy up to Jeremy just to seal this deal? That ring isn't just a trinket-it's a symbol of who he is. You expect me to believe he just handed it to you?"

Fury built inside him, blazing through his chest and flickering in his glare.
Giving up the struggle, Kayla fixed him with a cold stare. "What difference does it make how I secured the contract? You wanted a divorce. You wanted Perennia Group to have a future. Well, Jeremy handed it to you. Don't mess this up. If you do, you'll always be a nobody."

Pushed too far, Liam released her with a shout. "I don't need his help to make Perennia Group succeed!"

"Then why did you ask for his help in the first place? Quit lying to yourself, Liam. It's time you admit the truth."

Snatching the ring from his grasp, Kayla gripped her suitcase and walked away without hesitation.

Furniture rattled and gass shattered behind her as Liam's rage tore through the villa.

Not once did Kayla glance back.

Shaken by the chaos, Tricia appeared in the doorway."Stop tearing the place apart. The ring might not even be Jeremy's. Maybe it's from someone else."

Grinding his teeth, Liam glared at the door where Kayla had vanished. "I'm not letting her leave me, no matter what."
###Chapter 22 You're In A Relationship


At the hotel, Kayla stood at the front desk, handling her check-in and settling the bill, when a sharp, familiar voice cut through the quiet hum of the lobby.

"Well, if it isn't Kayla!"

Startled, Kayla whirled around, and her eyes locked onto a familiar face. Dewitt, one of Jeremy's closest friends.

He nodded toward the suitcase by her side. "What brings you here?"

"Hi!" Kayla greeted him, her tone measured as she slid the suitcase a little closer. "There's been some tension at home. I just need a couple of days away."

"Ah,,a quarrel with Liam? So, you're giving each other some space?"

Kayla said nothing. The silence hung between them like a quiet confirmation.

Just then, both receptionists rose from their seats and greeted him with practiced politeness.

Only then did it click-this hotel was owned by Nicolson Group.

Dewitt rested an elbow on the counter, histall frame exuding ease as he tapped his car keys against the polished surface. "She's my friend. Give her the luxury suite-put it on my tab."

Without hesitation, the receptionists began typing.

Kayla moved quickly to intervene. "That's really not necessary."
"Jeremy and I are buddies. You're married to his nephew-that makes you my friend too.A few days here on the house won't hurt. Let the staff know if you need anything." With that, he moved to grab her suitcase.

Kayla moved to the side, dodging him. Her smile was courteous, her posture resolute. "I appreciate the gesture, but I'd rather pay for my stay. Please, let me handle it." She extended her card to the receptionist without another word.

The receptionist paused, glancing at Dewitt for direction.

Dewitt raised both hands in mock surrender, lips curled in a playful grin. "If she insists, let her."

Only then did the receptionist swipe her card and complete the check-in.

"Thank you, Dewitt. I'll be heading up now," Kayla said softly, keeping her head low as she rolled the suitcase toward the elevators.

Given Dewitt's close connection to Jeremy, it was best to steer clear.

Dewitt watched as she stepped into the elevator, her figure vanishing behind the closing doors. With a slight shake of his head, he turned to leave. "Liam's letting his wife stay in a hotel? What a strange pair they make."

Meanwhile, Jeremy had spent the entire morning shuffling between back-to-back meetings. Zoe waited in his office the whole time.

When he finally walked in, she jumped to her feet, hurrying over with a tray of pastries and a fresh cup of coffee."You must be tired. Please, have something."

Jeremy sank into the leather chair with a quiet sigh, giving her a passing glance. "What brings you here?"

"I wanted to check on your arm. After all, it was my sister who injured you. I've been feeling terrible about it."

"It's nothing worth fussing over," he said flatly. The sharp angles of his face, sculpted and cold, gave nothing away.

Even with his aloof demeanor, Zoe found herself drawn in. A flush crept up her cheeks as she moved a little closer. "At least have a taste of the pastries I made for you."

Edwin, standing nearby, was just about to remind Zoe that Jeremy wasn't fond of sweets. But to his surprise, Jeremy reached out, took a pastry, and threw it into his mouth without a word.

Edwin's eyes widened in disbelief. Since when did Jeremy start liking sweets? Jeremy gave a small nod. "Not bad."

"Really? Then I'll make more next time!" Zoe's eyes lit up, thrilled by the praise.

"Leave them on the table. You're free to go. I've got things to handle."

"It's alright. I'll stay with you," Zoe replied, her gaze steady on him, unwilling to leave.

Jeremy's brow creased at her insistence. The clinginess grated on him, but the sense of obligation kept his frustration in check. He held back the urge to dismiss her.

The office door swung open just then.

Dewitt strolled in nonchalantly,his carefree laughter rolling in ahead of him.

"Jeez, Jeremy, it's freezing in here! Next time, crank up the heat. You're already icy-no need for the roomto compete with your personality." His eyes flicked to Zoe beside Jeremy. A knowing smirk curled his lips. "So this is what's been keeping you so quiet-you're in a relationship!"

Color rushed to Zoe's cheeks, and she dipped her head shyly.

Jeremy,unamused, shot Dewitt a cold look. "Don't you have something better to do?"

"So you aren't in a relationship? My bad. It just looks like things are heating up between you two,"Dewitt said,sliding a chair forward and settling into it with a mischievous grin.

Jeremy turned to Zoe with a pointed look. "You should leave."

"Okay. Don't forget the pastries." Zoe spared Dewitt a polite smile before slipping out.

Dewitt rubbed his chin thoughtfully, his eyes trailing after her for a moment."Zoe isn't as pretty as Kayla,and her figure's not on the same level either. You sure she's your type?"

A pen camne sailing through the air and landed in his lap.

Dewitt caught it, chuckling as he noticed the dark cloud settling over Jeremy's face. "Relax, I'm joking.Kayla's your nephew's wife-l wouldn't dare compare her to Zoe." "Did you stop by just to crack jokes? Is Nicolson Group going bankrupt or something? You sure seem to have plenty of time on your hands."

"Going bankrupt? Come on. You're blowving this out of proportion!"

Jeremy said nothing, pushing the pastries aside and returning to his documents.

Dewitt leaned on the desk, propping his chin in his hand. "Anyway, I bumped into Kayla at the hotel earlier."
###Chapter 23 Liam And I Are Done


Flipping through the papers, Jeremy paused, his gaze dark and unreadable."And what does that have to do with me?"

Across the desk,Dewvitt leaned in, a grin spreading as mischief twinkled inhis eyes.′′Γ guessing she had a fight with Liamn, which is why she moved out. As Liam's uncle, you ought to step up and play peacemaker."

"You must really be running out of ways to entertain yourself."

Light laughter bubbled from Dewitt. "Relax, I'm just poking fun. Even if you marry Zoe and Kayla becomes your slster-in-law, it's not like you'd have any real say in their drama."

Mention of Zoe wiped away any hint of warmth from Jeremy's face, leaving only icy distance in his posture.

Feeling the tension, Dewitt wrapped his arms around himself in mock shivers. "All jokes aside,are you really sure about Zoe? Honestly, you two don't seem like a good fit."

Without looking up, Jeremy went back to reviewing the files. "If you're just here to waste time, do it somewhere else. I've got work to finish."

Dewitt dragged himself to his feet, giving Jeremy a lazy pat on the back. "Still keeping secrets, huh? Fine,fine. I'I let it go. Whoever you wind up with, I'll always have your back. That's what good friends are for."

Right as Dewitt reached the doorway, he spun around, a sudden spark lighting his eyes. "One more thing-l bought into a fancy travel business. They're doing a soft opening. Two weeks of fun. Come with me. We both need a break."

Jeremy shot him a look that could freeze water.′′Admit it, you're just looking to pick up women. I'm not interested."

Dewitt slouched against the doorframe, sighing with theatrical disappointment. "Without you around,chasing girls isn't even fun. Someone's got to keep me in check, right? And now that you're with Zoe, I guess I have to double down on finding my own catch." A dry, amused scoff slipped out of Jeremy. "You? As if you've ever had trouble in that department.

Truth be told, Dewitt was notorious for breaking hearts and cycling through girlfriends like outfits. There wasn't a woman he couldn't win over.

"Don't say that. I was just making friends with girls. I'm still a virgin, you know."

In Tesponse, Jeremy picked up the nearest book and sent it flying at Dewitt's head.

A quick sidestep took Dewitt safely out of range, and he disappeared down the hall before Jeremy could say another word.

Stillness swept through the office again, broken only by the gentle flutter of curtains stirred by the night air.

Without meaning to, Jeremy found his eyes drawn to the paperwork scattered across his desk.Among the forms, Kayla's graceful script caught his attention.

No matter how hard he tried to focus, images of Kayla kept flickering in his mind, stubborn and relentless.

After catching her breath at the hotel, Kayla made her way over to the care facility later that evening to check on Marsha.

Instead of finding Marsha in her room, Kayla was met by the caregiver, who explained that a doctor had taken Marsha for a treatment session. It could be a while before she returned.

Trusting the explanation, Kayla decided not tolinger and headed back to her hotel room.

Tomorrow, her plans included a trip to the courthouse to apply for the divorce. Saving her energy, seemed wise. After that, a whole new life awaited her.

Night gave way to dawn in the blink of an eye, sunlight stretching across the city.

Long before the courthouse doors opened, Kayla was already there. She passed the time by sending a couple of messages to Liam, waiting for him to arrive.

A rush of hope had filled her the day she registered her marriage with Liam. Now, urgency and a desperate need for freedom replaced that old excitement.Once,marriage had brought comfort. These days, it felt more like a prison.

The first step toward reclaiming her future meant cutting these final ties.

"Kayla!"

The sound of a familiar voice pulled Kayla from her thoughts. She spun around, her body tense with surprise.

Across the marble floor, Marsha appeared, leaning on Líam's arm as they slowly approached.

An instinctive jolt sent Kayla scrambling upright. "Grandma? Why are you even here?"

Sadness etched deep lines into Marsha's face as she wasted no time launching into her lecture. "What's gotten into you, Kayla? Liam's a wonderful husband. Why on earth would you throw him away?"

A cold weight pressed down on Kayla's chest. She shot Liam a glare. "What did you say to her, Liam?Did you drag my grandmother into this on purpose?"

With wide, untroubled eyes, Liam looked the picture of innocence. "Kayla, don't make things so difficult.Let's just go home, okay? The divorce news crushed Marsha. She just wants us to make things right."

Disbelief clouded Kayla's face. "Unbelievable. So this is your new low, Liam? Hauling my grandmother here to guilt me into staying? You never cease to amaze me."

A heavy sigh passed Liam's lips, but his expression stayed gentle. "That's not fair, Kayla. Marsha is family.She deserves to know what's going on, and all she wants is for us to be happy together."

Kayla straightened her shoulders, her. tone unyielding. "This divorce is happening today. Nothing's going to change my mind."

"Absolutely not!" Marsha snapped, her voice rising with fierce determination.

Helplessness crept over Kayla, the realization settling in that Liam had shamelessly brought Marsha just to force her hand.

Doing her best to keep calm, Kayla reached for patience. "Grandma, I need you to stay out of this. Let me "What more is there to talk about? Liam's been nothing but good to you. He told me you've been upset lately, but that's no excuse for making such a reckless decision. Do you have any idea how much a divorce can damage a woman's reputation?" said Marsha, shooting down the idea with a wave of her hand.

Years of tradition shaped Marsha's thinking, and Kayla knew there was little hope of changing her mind. In Marsha's world, divorce was a scandal that doomed a woman to gossip and loneliness.

Bracing herself, Kayla held her ground. "Grandma, you don't know everything. Liam and I are done. There's nothing left to fix."

Chiming in, Liam tried again, putting on a wounded act. "Honey, if this is about my secretary, I'll let her go first thing tomorrow. Don't do this over something so small, please."
###Chapter 24 You Make Me Sick


Kayla's fists clenched at her sides. The urge to scream-or spit in Liam's smug face-threatened to overwhelm her.

How could someone be so shameless? After everything they'd been through, only now was Liam's true nature fully revealed.

But her grandmother still believed in him. As if he'd put her under some spell.

Martha stepped forward, her grip tightening around Kayla's hand. "No matter what happened, you two can still work it out. There's no need to end things like this."

Kayla's voice was steady but firm. "I've made up my mind, Grandma. This marriage is over."

"You're going to drive me to my grave!" Martha suddenly gasped, her chest heaving as she clutched at it in pain.

"Grandma!" Kayla's eyes widened in alarm as she rushed to support her.

Martha's face had gone pale, her breath shallow and uneven.

Liam, standing nearby, jumped in with false concern. "Let's get her back to the care facility. She can't handle this kind of stress."

Kayla shot him a look so cold it could cut steel. If looks could kill, Liam would have dropped on the spot.

Back at the facility, Martha remained confused and restless. She clung to Kayla's hand, repeating the same plea over and over.

"Your mother's marriage fell apart, and it destroyed her. I just don't want the same for you. Liam made mistakes, sure, but people change. You two just need to talk."

Kayla looked into her grandmother's kind, tired eyes and could no longer hold back the truth. "He cheated on me, Grandma. Just like my father did my mother." Martha froze. Disbelief flooded her expression.

Kayla gently brushed her grandmother's silver hair from her forehead. "I know you only want the best for me. But Liam and I are finished."

Martha's voice cracked. "You must be mistaken,sweetheart."

Too weary to argue, Kayla exhaled deeply. "Please, just rest."

Only once Martha drifted off to sleep did Kayla finally leave the facility.

Liam was waiting outside, leaning against his car. When he saw her, he straightened. "Is Marsha okay?"

The answer came in the form of a resounding slap.

Liam's head turned with the impact, pain flashing across his face.

Kayla's face was burning with rage. "Don't you dare try to hide behind my grandmother to stop this divorce.Have some shame, Liam. You make me sick."

Liam ran his tongue along the inside of his cheek, tasting blood. He wiped it away and gave her a slow,almost affectionate smile. "I didn't know you had this side to you, Kayla. Fiery."

His voice took on that infuriatingly familiar tone-the same one he'd used back when she'd broken a vase.

She used to think that made him gentle; that she was lucky to have a man like him.

Now, it made her skin crawl.

"Liam, I'm not done with you. Not even close."

Then she turned her back on him and flagged down a cab.

Liam watched her go, his cheek still stinging, but his smile remained. She hadn't divorced him yet. That was all he needed.

His phone buzzed. It was his assistant.

"Mr. Graham, you need to get to the office. North Investment just sent a team to audit us." "What? We're just partners! They don't have the right to do that."

"Sir, I think you'd better come and see for yourself."

Liam stormed into his office.

Inside,Edwin stood with a team, already laying out files. He tossed a thick document onto the desk as Liam entered.

"Liam, your uncle is now a major stakeholder in Perennia Group. This is a standard audit. Please cooperate."

Liam stared at the document in confusion. When he saw the signature at the bottom, his face twisted in disbelief. "Kayla transferred hér shares to Jeremy?"

Edwin raised a brow. "You think you can toss Mr. Graham's name around like it's yours to use?"

Liam's voice turned desperate. "No offense meant. I had no clue Kayla signed this. There must be some mistake!"

Edwin tapped the document with a finger. "There's no mistake. Your wife signed over her shares. See for yourself."

Liam's face darkened as he gripped the paper. Even furious, he knew better than to lash out in front of Edwin.

Edwin stepped closer, smirking slightly. "You were eager enough to cozy up to North Investment. Now that Mr. Graham's personally involved, you should be thrilled. And your wife said you'll be returning Cooper Group. If not, Mr. Graham's happy to handle it for her."

Liam's eyes narrowed, fury simmering beneath the surface. "There's no need to bother UJncle Jeremy.I'll take care of it."

"Good. Let's begin the audit."

Edwin and his team moved out into the office, instructing all staff to stand by.

Tricia crept over, voice barely above a whisper. "Liam, what do we do? If they find out about the cooked numbers-"

Liam cut her off with a glare that could kill.

She went silent instantly.

"Let them dig," he muttered."Ifanything surfaces, we'll blame it on past partners. Jeremy can't touch me.I'm the one running Perennia Group."

He strode from his office, watching Edwin like a hawk as the audit began.
###Chapter 25 Encounter Jeremy In The Hospital


Seated in the exam room, Kayla listened as the doctor said, "Ma'am, you gave yourself quite a fright with that scare today. It's important to take things slow and try to keep your stress in check."

Eyes drifting to the paperwork on the table, she let her hand settle gently over her still-smooth stomach.

Following the chaos with Liam earlier, she had retreated to the hotel. But an uneasy feeling crept in as soon as she lay down, sending her straight to the hospital without a second thought.

Relief washed over her when the doctor assured her it was nothing too serious. Any worse, and she might have lost her grip entirely.

Pregnancy hadn't thriled her at first. Yet, as the weeks went on, she found herself growing attached, even a little protective.

A small smile flickered as she answered, "Thanks, doctor. I'll take care of myself."

With a prescription for stabilizing medication in hand, Kayla collected what she needed and prepared to leave.

"Kayla?" someone called from down the hall.

The sound made her jump. She quickly slipped the medicine bag behind her and looked up.

Edwin appeared, looking surprised. "What a coincidence!"

"Is Jeremy here?" Kayla asked, her eyes darting to the cluster of bodyguards nearby. That kind of security detail was unmistakable-Jeremy must be in the building.

Edwin confirmed her suspicion with a nod."He′Sjust here for a bandage change. Should be finishing up any minute now."

That mention jolted Kayla's memory. She remembered the injury on Jeremy's arm-the one she had caused. Edwin asked, "Would you like to see him while you're here?"

An immediate shake of her head followed. "No. I have things I need to take care of. Maybe another time."

There was no way she'd go looking for Jeremy. Avoiding him felt like the only sensible option.

Suddenly, Edwin added, "By the way, Mr. Graham had us review Perennia Group's records yesterday. Some problems turned up."

"What kind of problems?" Kayla asked, confused. It had been a year since she'd had any involvement with Perennia Group, and she had no clue what mess Liam might have created.

A moment of silence passed before Edwin answered, "You don't know anything about it?"

A firm note crept into Kayla's voice. "Just tell me what's going on:"

With a nervous scratch to his nose, Edwin replied, "You should ask Mr.Graham."

Kayla pressed on, frowning. "Why send me to Jeremy when you're the one standing here with all the answers?"

"If she doesn't want to see me, why push her?" said a crisp, icy voice that sliced through the air.

Instantly, the hairs on Kayla's neck stood up as a shiver darted down her spine.

Edwin turned and nodded respectfully. "Mr.Graham."

Sharp in his tailored black suit, Jeremy exuded both elegance and authority, drawing subtle glances from everyone in the hallway.

His steps rang out with quiet confidence as he sauntered over, hands tucked into his pockets.

A deep breath steadied Kayla before she turned, masking her nerves with a polite smile."What are the odds we'd run into each other here, Jeremy?"

With nothing more than a frosty look, Jeremy dismissed her attempt at pleasantries.

Edwin moved ahead to hold open the car door, waiting as Jeremy leaned down and slipped into the back
seat.

Determined to get answers about Perennia Group, Kayla tucked her medication away and moved closer to the open window.

"Jeremy, would you mind explaining what exactly is wrong with Perennia Group?"

Reclining against the leather seat, Jeremy kept his eyes closed, offering her nothing but silence.

"Jeremy?" Kayla tried again, her patience wearing thin.

Edwin interjected, "You should come with us. Mr. Graham is on a tight schedule and can't afford to be late."

Not seeing another way, Kayla climbed into the car, her mind churning with questions.

A heavy, uncomfortable silence pressed down on the car as it rolled forward, making Kayla fidget in her seat.

Only when they reached a red light did Jeremy finally break the silence, his tone glacial. "Didn't you insist on keeping your distance? What changed your mind?"

"I think you're misreading the situation. I just didn't want to be a bother..."

Her sentence was cut short when the car jerked to a halt, sending her forward.

Thrown off balance, Kayla collided with Jeremy's chest, momentarily stunned by the firm impact.

Her head spun for a moment after bumping into the solid wall of his chest.

Jeremy caught her by the waist, his other hand lifting her chin as his voice turned cold.

"Funny how you weren't so concerned about being a bother when you came running to me for help with Perennia Group."
###Chapter 26 Not Jeremy's Wife


A stunned silence took hold of Kayla, her eyes widening with a mixture of fear and confusion.

Catching the flicker of panic in her expression, Jeremy's harsh exterior melted ever so slightly before he let her go.

Without wasting a second, Kayla slid away toward the window, her fingers absently massaging her sore jaw.
"I just need answers about Perennia Group. That's all."

Determination radiated from her voice, making it clear she wouldn't back down.

Loosening his tie,Jeremy kept his face impassive. "Edwin's people found a mess-phony investors, cooked financials, and some serious tax evasion."

"You're kidding! That can't be true!"

Signs of trouble had always haunted the back of her mind, especially with Liam so desperate for North Investment's support, but this revelation felt much darker than she ever expected.

Suddenly,she realized just how badly Liam had botched things, crossing the line into illegal territory for a quick profit.

A folder landed in her lap as Jeremy tossed it over. "If you don't believe me, have a look for yourself."

Papers rustled as Kayla flipped through the folder, eyes racing over line after line of damning evidence.

The blood drained from her cheeks as Jeremy continued, "Trying to reclaim Cooper Group? I wouldn't bother. There's nothing left to save."

Every asset had been stripped. Liam hadn't just mismanaged-he'd bled Cooper Group dry, leaving only debts behind.

Shock hit Kayla so hard she could barely breathe. m to ruin everything.

An unreadable look crossed Jeremy's face as he watched her reaction. "Liam's been busy, hasn't he? Even if you get it back, Cooper Group is worthless now."

"That company is my mother's legacy. I don't care how bad things are. I'm taking it back."

The intensity in her voice caught Jeremy's attention, making him study her a moment longer.

A sleek estate came into view as the car glided to a stop.

Twisting around, Edwin said, "We've arrived, Mr. Graham."

"I'll leave you to your meeting, then," Kayla said, reaching for the door.

Before she could step out, an assistant approached, offering a quick update. "Mr. Graham, Mr. Nicolson wanted you to know that Mr. Newton's already inside and waiting for you."

Mr.Newton?

Kayla paused-one foot hung in the air before she slid back into the seat.

"Understood." Jeremy nodded, catching the look on her face. "Was there something you wanted to ask?"

Curiosity piqued, Kayla leaned in and asked, "Are you talking about the president of Newton Group?"

From what she'd read in the reports, it looked like Liam had put Cooper Group up as collateral with Newton Group.

If her hunch was correct, getting close to Mr. Newton could be her only way forward.

Suspicion flickered in Jeremy's gaze as he seemed to size up her motives. With a slight nod,he said,"That's right."

Not missing a beat, Kayla offered him a bright smile. "Since you're still recovering, let me walk you in. You could use an extra hand."
Resourcefulness shone through-Kayla wasn't about to let this opportunity slip by.

Though Jeremny offered no response, Kayla plowed ahead. "Decision made. I'm coming with you!"

A barely-there smirk touched Edwin's lips. Very few people dared to steamroll Jeremy like this.

Their destination loomed ahead-a private golf course known for catering to the city's most powerful players.

Perfectly trimmed lawns and impeccable staff sent a clear message: this was a sanctuary for the ultra-wealthy.

One of the servers met them at the entrance, her greeting polished and warm."Welcome, Mr.Graham."

Her eyes landed on Kayla, and the smile widened. "Mrs. Graham, it's good to see you."

A strange hush seemed to settle in the group.

She was Mrs. Graham, but was not Jeremy's wife.

"Actually,I-"

"She isn't my wife!" Jeremy cut her off.

"Sorry," the server said, her expression sheepish as she ushered them forward.

Across the manicured lawns, clusters of men in designer suits laughed and talked among themselves.

Dewitt stood out from the crowd, an arm slung casually around a pretty young woman while he chatted with a striking man beside him.

That striking man, Kayla guessed, had to be Mr. Newton.

"Jeremy! Took you long enough. We've been dying of boredom," Dewitt called out. His eyes then landed on Kayla,lighting up with mischief."Kayla!"

Archie Newton offered Jeremy a firm handshake before giving Kayla an inquisitive once-over.

Rather than introduce Kayla, Jeremy left the silence stretching, making no move to break it. Dewitt cleared his throat, jumping in to fill the awkward gap. "This is Kayla. Her husband is Jeremy's nephew."

Kayla caught Archie's gaze, which lingered a moment longer before he smiled. "Archie Newton. Nice to meet you."

"Nlice to meet you too." Kayla smiled sweetly.

Not missing a beat, Dewitt shot Archie a look. "You might not know Kayla personally, but I'm sure you know her husband,Liam."

Confidence radiated from Kayla as she stepped forward, her chin held high. "Actually, I'm divorcing Liam,so there's no need to link us. Mr. Newton, I understand you've had some business with Perennia Group?"

Warmth replaced formality in Archie's reply, his presence more inviting than Jeremy's ever was. "That's right. I've been out of the country, though, so my deputy oversaw most of the dealings. Today's meeting is really about catching up with Jeremy."

"I see." Processing this, Kayla's mind worked overtime, searching for the right opening to discuss Cooper Group.

Dewitt let go of his companion and leaned toward Jeremy, teasing, "Bringing family to work now, huh?You're setting quite the example."
###Chapter 27 Archie's Invitation To Join The Newton Group


Kayla wasted no time approaching Archie. "Mr. Newton, could I ask you something?"

With a warm grin, Archie replied, "Of course. What's on your mind?"

"Do you remember Cooper Group? You have it as collateral now."

"Cooper Group..." Archie thought for a second, then it clicked. "So that's your family's company.My deputy did mention it in an email. We had a contract with Perennia Group, but they failed to deliver, left us in the lurch financially. Unable to cover the losses, they pledged Cooper Group as security."

Kayla stayed silent, listening.

Archie continued, "You had no idea what your husband was up to, did you? Honestly, Cooper Group's assets couldn't even begin to cover what we lost. So Liam decided to charm my deputy's secretary and pull her into his schemes."

Archie's eyes gleamed with amusement."The secretary fell for it and slipped Liam our upcoming project plans. That info is what let Perennia Group crawl back from the brink. When I found out, she was fired immediately."

Every word landed like a punch. The truth left the small crowd in shock.

Humiliation flooded Kayla, her cheeks blazing. She had been played for a fool-Liam's tricks had even reached as far as Newton Group.

Off in the distance, Jeremy kept hitting golf balls, keeping himself out of the unfolding drama.

Laughter burst from Dewitt. "Jeremy, your nephew's really got a talent-turns out his face is his ticket to success. Kayla, talk about bad luck with a guy like that."

Kayla's expression soured, and Dewitt quickly softened his tone. "Hey, it's not all bad. You're dumping him anyway, so you're smart enough to spot a snake." None of it seemed to register. Kayla's mind was spinning. How could Liam have hidden so much from her for so long?

Her voice came out low, almost pleading, as she faced Archie again. "Mr. Newton, Cooper Group was my mom's legacy. Is there any way you could let me have it back?"

Archie glanced at Jeremy, his look loaded with meaning. "Newton Group suffered real losses thanks to your husband. Cooper Group is tied up as collateral in their contract with us. That's not something that can be undone by a simple request."

Still, Kayla didn't give up. "I realize it's asking a lot, but Cooper Group is important to me. I need to get it back."

A thoughtful look crossed Archie's face. "How about this? Join Newton Group. Show me what you can do. lf you impress me, I'll hand you the negotiations with Perennia Group to void the contract. The future of Cooper Group will then be in your hands."

Kayla paused,weighing the offer.

Landing a spot at Newton Group was no small feat-it was the most prestigious company in Trark. A career there would open countless doors.

Yet, staying put in Trark would upend her plan to leave.

Any delay risked exposing her pregnancy; the longer she lingered, the harder it would be to keep her secret.

"Are you alright, Mr. Graham?"

Edwin's anxious voice cut through the conversation as he hurried to Jeremy's side, worry etched across his face.

The group's attention shifted instantly.

Swinging a golf club had clearly put too much strain on Jeremy's still-mending arm.

"No need to fuss. I'm fine," he replied. A mischievous glint lit up Dewitt's eyes. "We set up this whole match, but you show up injured. How are you going to play? You may as well forfeit now!"

Jeremy simply waved off their concerns. "A little scratch like this won't keep me out of the game."

Just then, a bodyguard stepped forward and said, "Mr. Graham, Zoe Cooper has arrived."

Dewitt's eyes lit up at the announcement. "Well, what a surprise! Let's have her join us!"

Moments later, Zoe came, her arrival marked by a delicate cloud of fragrance.

Dressed in a sharp white tracksuit, hair pulled into a high ponytail, Zoe looked energetic and ready for anything.

Kayla fought the urge to roll her eyes. Did Zoe really have to show up everywhere she went?

Archie, seeing Zoe for the first time, turned with a puzzled look. "And who might this be?"

Dewitt's voice boomed, maybe with a hint of mischief. "That's Zoe Cooper, Kayla's older sister, and Jeremy's special someone."

Archie's brows shot up, his lips twitching in surprise. "So Jeremy's girl and his nephew's wife are sisters?"

The comment didn't escape Kayla's or Zoe's notice.

Zoe's smile grew even more self-assured, though she kept her tone polite. "If Kayla's made any waves today, I'll take responsibility for her."

Archie simply brushed it aside. "No trouble at all. It's a pleasure meeting you both."

"Appreciate it, Mr. Newton." Zoe shot Kayla a smug look before turning to Jeremy. "You shouldn't strain yourself,Jeremy.Let me help you inside."

Jeremy's face remained a mask, but he surrendered his club to an attendant and stepped away from the green.

Zoe looped her arm through his, wearing a satisfied smile as she escorted him. As everyone headed for the lounge, Dewitt threw out another suggestion. "Since Zoe's here, why not have her fill in for Jeremy on the course?"

Zoe froze for a heartbeat but kept her composure. "Golf isn't really my thing, so I'll have to pass."

With a laugh, Dewitt shrugged. "Jeremy, looks like you'll have to give up."
###Chapter 28 Zoe's Jealousy


"Whoever loses has to cough up two sports cars worth ten million each," Dewitt said with a cocky grin."Poor Jeremy."

Zoe's eyes widened, stunned."Ten million?" she blurted out.

Archie chuckled. "We always play high stakes. Since he's decided to given up, it means he loses."

Jeremy sat silently, lounging in a chair, sipping his coffee like the whole thing was beneath him.

Kayla stood nearby, her thoughts swirling.

Two cars meant twenty million dollas. For someone like Jeremy, that was probably pocket change.

If she had that kind of cash, she could've already reclaimed Cooper Group, whisked Martha away, and set up her future kid's life without blinking.

"Do you know how to play golf?" Jeremy asked suddenly.

Kayla glanced around, realizing he was talking to her.′′Alittlle1′′she replied.

"Give it a try," he said casually.

Kayla gave a nervous laugh. "I can play, sure, but wasting time on stuff like this isn't really my thing."

"One million," Jeremy said.

Kayla froze.

He stood to lose twenty million, and he was offering her just one?

Rich people could be so stingy.

Noticing her pout, Jeremy added coolly, "Five million. Don't push your luck." "Deal!" Kayla agreed without hesitation.

Five million wasn't chump change. She'd be out of her mind to turn it down.

With everyone watching, Kayla stepped onto the course.

Zoe, watching her, scoffed quietly.

If she couldn't play, there was no way Kayla could. Kayla was about to make a fool of herself.

Kayla picked up the club and nailed her first shot with precision.

Her swing was smooth, practiced-not the swing of a novice.

As she moved, her slender frame cut a graceful silhouette against the green.

Under the sunlight, her skin glowed, and her striking features held every eye on the field.

The men were floored. She wasn't just beautiful-she could play.

"She's actually good!" Zoe gasped,jealousy flaring.

Kayla remained cool and composed.

Her mother had been a powerhouse in business-and on the golf course.

Growing up, Kayla had tagged along, soaking up the game naturally.

Zoe noticed Jeremy watching Kayla, and it grated on her.

She clenched her fists so hard, a manicured nail snapped.

"Didn't see that coming. She's legit," Dewitt said, clearly impressed.

Archie nodded. "Even if both of us went up against her, we'd still lose. She's a ringer."

Dewitt chuckled. "Jeremy, you hit the jackpot. Having Kayla on your side? Total win."

Jeremy's coffee sat cold and forgotten, his gaze locked on Kayla. She hadn't just been downplaying her skills-she'd been sandbagging.

The match ended perfectly, and Kayla strolled back,relaxed and confident.

Dewitt and Archie clapped in unison.

"Wow,Kayla, you're full of surprises. Color me impressed."

"You're too kind," Kayla replied with a smile, then turned to Jeremy. "That five million you promised... Don't forget."

Jeremy nodded coolly."Edwin will transfer it to you tomorrow."

Kayla beamed. "Thank you."

Five million for swinging a golf club? This day was a jackpot.

Trying to regain the spotlight, Zoe had a tray of drinks brought over. "I brewed some coffee, folks. Take a break and enjoy."

"Wow, thanks," Dewitt said.

Kayla frowned at the cup handed to her.

Pregnant, she knew caffeine was off-limits.

After passing out the drinks, Zoe noticed Kayla hadn't taken a sip. "What's wrong? Not a fan of my coffee?"

Kayla raised a brow. "Not at all. I just prefer mine sweet. Mind grabbing some sugar?"

"Such a diva," Zoe muttered as she turned to fetch it.

That was when Kayla noticed-Jeremy wasn't drinking coffee.His cup held juice.

Zoe was playing favorites, and she was not even subtleabout it.

She sidled up to Jeremy and whispered,"Can we swap drinks?"

Jeremy eyed her coffee cup suspiciously. "What, did you spike it?" Kayla laughed, awkward but genuine. "No, nothing like that. I'm just not in the mood for coffee today."

Jeremy handed over his juice with a casual wave. "Here."

By the time Zoe returned with sugar, Kayla's cup was empty.

"I thought you wanted sugar?" Zoe asked, irritation leaking through her smile.

Kayla blinked innocently. "You took so long, I just drank it."

Zoe felt played, but quickly brushed it off.

Seeing Kayla's empty cup, she smirked toherself.

As long as she drank it, that was what counted.
###Chapter 29 Jeremy's Allergic Reaction


Outside the restroom, Kayla paced nervously.

Just as she turned, Archie emerged. Their eyes locked.

"Waiting for me?" he asked with a cool smile.

Kayla approached, forcing a calm demeanor. "Could we speak in private?"

Archie arched a brow. "Sure.",

They moved to a quiet corner and sat facing each other.

Kayla twisted her fingers together before asking carefully,′′|sthere any way I can reclaim Cooper Group without joining your company?"

Archie offered a faint smile. "I admire your directness. No games, just straight talk."

Kayla gave a wry smile, her hands still restless. "If I had time,I'd play the long game. But I don't.I need Cooper Group back-soon."

He looked curious. "And what exactly does that mean?"

"You said if I joined Newton Group, you'd return Cooper Group to me."

Archie leaned back, legs crossed, hands clasped on the table, his refined face breaking into a smile. "Do you know why I agreed to work with Perennia Group back then?"

Kayla frowned, uncertain. "Wasn't it because their project had solid potential? Newton Group needed that kind of momentum."

She recalled the timing-Newton Group's deal with Perennia Group had launched right after she stepped away from Perennia.

"I came across a proposal," Archie said, his tone nostalgic. "It blew me away-visionary, one of the most compelling I'd seen in years. I figured any group with that kind of talent was headed for success."

Kayla hesitated. "So, what are you saying?"

Archie met her gaze. "Your name was on that proposal. When Dewitt introduced you earlier, I recognized your work. I just hadn't realized you are Liam's wife."

Kayla's smile was soft, touched with surprise. "That was a long time ago. I nearly forgot I wrote it. Thanks for remembering."

Archie leaned forward slightly. "Your proposals, your ad campaigns-they were bold, creative. As sharp as Liam's, maybe sharper. So why did you step away and become a housewife?"

A flicker of regret crossed her face. "I got swept up in love. Lost my judgment. But pain teaches you things.And now, I've got a chance to set things right."

Archie didn't pry. "The door to Newton GGroup is open. Say the word, and you're in. As for Cooper Group-it'll be yours when the time is right."

Kayla nodded thoughtfully. "Thank you. I'll give it serious thought."

"I'll be waiting," Archie said with a smile.

As Kayla walked away, Archie's assistant approached.

"Sir, she seems close with Jeremy Graham. Are you sure about bringing her on board?"

Archie shrugged. "Jeremy's already got Zoe, and Kayla's married. He won't mind. I care about talent, and she's got it in spades."

In the lounge, Zoe sat across from Jeremy.

As he ended a video call, she quickly offered him a glass of water. "You must be exhausted. Here-drink this."

Jeremy glanced at her, voice neutral. "Shouldn't you be heading home?"

Zoe straightened, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. "I said I'd stay today, so I'm sticking around till you
finish."

Jeremy began flipping through papers, focused. "I've got another meeting online. I'll have the driver take you home."

"No rush. I'm free today. Want a quick shoulder massage?"

Before he could respond, Zoe stepped behind him and gently placed her hands on his shoulders.

Suddenly, Jeremy sneezed and recoiled from her touch.

Zoe froze. "Are you okay?"

Edwin entered just in time. "Ms. Cooper, your perfume is too strong. Mr. Graham's sensitive to it. You should go."

"Huh?" Zoe hadn't expected the extra spritz of perfume in the restroom to cause such a reaction.

Jeremy sneezed again, visibly uncomfortable.

Though clearly reluctant, Zoe gathered her things and left.

Once she was gone, Edwin handed Jeremy a glassof water, then paused. "Sir, your neck!"

Jeremy frowned. "What about it?"

"You've got red spots," Edwin said, alarmed. "Did you touch something? Maybe the perfume?"

Jeremy rolled up his sleeve, revealing more spots along his arm.

He hadn't done anything unusual that day. What triggered the reaction?

"We should get you to a hospital," Edwin urged. "This doesn't look good."

Jeremy waved him off. "No need. There's a clinic here. Just bring me something for the reaction."

"But sir-" Edwin protested.

"I said now," Jeremy snapped. "Stop wasting time." Grimacing,Edwin hurried out.

In the hallway, Kayla nearly collided with him.

"Edwin, what's the rush?" she asked.

"Mr. Graham's having an allergic reaction. I'm getting meds." With that, Edwin rushed off.

Kayla's brow furrowed. "Allergic reaction?" she muttered, stepping closer to the lounge.

Inside, Jeremy looked up. Their eyes met.
###Chapter 30 Applying The Ointment


"Come in."

Jeremy's voice was as cold and commanding as ever.

Kayla stepped inside, stopping a few feet from his desk. "I heard you're having an allergic reaction. Is it serious?"

Jeremy let out a soft scoff. "So you do care about me."

Kayla offered a polite smile. "Of course. You're family, after all."

Jeremy studied her closely-sweet face, the picture of innocence. But he knew better. She wore kindness like a mask, saving her edge for when it counted.

Suddenly, his arm beganto itch violently, and he reached to scratch it.

"Don't!" Kayla stepped forward instinctively.

Back when she was a kid, she'd had the same kind of reaction.

"Don't scratch-it'll spread and could get infected. Just wait for the ointment."

Jeremy clenched his jaw and resisted the urge, forcing himself to endure the irritation.

What triggered this?

Kayla's mind raced. Then it hit her-the coffee Zoe had given her earlier.

Jeremy had sipped the coffee. That was all it took.

Same dirty tricks after all these years, Kayla thought bitterly.

If she'd taken that cup, she'd be the one scratching right now. "Did you drink that coffee earlier?" Kayla asked suddenly.

"Just a sip," Jeremy replied.

Just a sip-and already a reaction. A whole cup could've sent him to the ER.

Kayla's expression darkened.

Jeremy noticed. "What are you thinking?"

Kayla shook her head quickly. "Nothing."

It was no use accusing Zoe-not without proof. Jeremy would think she was just stirring trouble.

At that moment, Edwin returned with the ointment. "Mr. Graham, the doctor said it's a skin allergy. You'll need to apply the ointment right away."

Edwin began to help but was interrupted by a phone call. After a quick exchange, he turned back. "Sir, Mr.Newton is leaving. Should we go see him off?"

Jeremy nodded. "You go. I'll stay."

"But the ointment..."

"She can handle it," Jeremy said, glancing at Kayla.

Edwin hesitated, then left.

Kayla pointed at herself. "Me? You want me to apply your ointment?"

Without answering, Jeremy removed his jacket and unbuttoned his black shirt.

Towering at six-foot-three, he revealed a chiseled frame-broad shoulders, a defined chest, lean muscle taut beneath his skin.

Kayla froze.Her ears turned red. Then Jeremy turned, baring his sculpted back.
Her heart skipped. Her cheeks flamed. And a warm drip landed on her lip.

She touched her face and paled. A nosebleed? Seriously?

This was so embarrassing. She couldn't even handle his back without bleeding.

"What's the holdup?" Jeremy, noticing her hesitation, began to glance over his shoulder.

"I'm doing it now!" Kayla blurted out, pressing a hand to his back to keep him from turning.

She grabbed a tissue, wiped her nose quickly, and forced herself to focus.

Her cool hand met his warm skin, and Jeremy tensed. A strange electricity passed between them.

He shut his eyes and exhaled slowly. "Just get it over with."

"Right...here goes," she muttered.

Kayla opened the tube and began applying the ointment with gentle strokes.

In the soft light, their silhouettes merged-his tall, strong frame and her smaller, delicate form casting one shadow on the wall.

That night-the one she tried not to think about-had been too dark to see him clearly. But now,his perfection was impossible to ignore.

Heat bloomed in her cheeks again.

Jeremy, for his part, was trying to ignore the soft scent of her perfume-subtle but intoxicating.

When Kayla moved around to his front, still flustered, she said, "Could you close your eyes?"

With a reluctant sigh, Jeremy shut his eyes. Kayla's hands moved across his chest, light as feathers.

The door burst open.

"Jeremy, where have you been? Hiding out in-whoa." Dewitt stopped in his tracks.

Kayla,crouched in front of Jeremy, jumped and dropped the tube. "Sorry! Didn't mean to interrupt. I'll come back." Dewitt scratched his nose, already turning to leave.

"Wait, why don't you help Jeremy with this?" Kayla stood, blushing furiously. Without waiting for a response,she darted out of the room.

Dewitt blinked, watching her disappear.

Jeremy opened his eyes, catching Dewitt's grin. "What's so funny?"

Dewitt teased, "Smooth, Jeremy. Flirting with your nephew's wife? You scared her out the door."

"I asked her to help apply some ointment," Jeremy said, casually buttoning his shirt.

Dewitt raised an eyebrow. "You could've asked anyone. She's Liam's wife."

"You're overthinking. It was just an ointment. Try finding a hobby."

As Jeremy finished dressing and moved to leave, Dewitt called out with a teasing lilt, "Still itching? Want me to call Kayla back?"

Jeremy shot him a warning glare."Get lost."

Dewitt chuckled, leaning against the desk, arms folded. "Looks like the ice king's finally melting."
###Chapter 31 Teaching Tricia A Lesson


Kayla waited at the roadside, the humid air finally giving way as a light breeze brushed past, cooling her skin.

Her chest still thudded with the lingering rush of emotions, her cheeks tinged pink as fragments of the earlier encounter replayed in her mind.

A sleek black Maybach rolled to a stop beside her, its arrival subtle yet impossible to ignore.

The window on the passenger side slid down with a quiet hum, and Edwin's face appeared. He regarded her with calm civility. "Would you like a ride home? It's on the way."

From the back seat, an icy stare seemed to cut straight through the barrier of glass.

Jeremy's refined profile was barely visible in the reflection, yet it carried unmistakable weight.

Kayla steadied her breath and gave a gentle response. "Thank you, but my ride is already on the way."

Edwin looked over his shoulder before giving her a courteous nod. "Very well. Goodbye."

The car eased back into motion and disappeared down the street.

Kayla pressed her palms to her warm cheeks and let out an exasperated whisper."It was just applying an ointment-no bid deal!"

A moment later, her ride pulled up. She stepped in without delay and left the scene behind.

Over the next few days, Kayla deliberately kept her distance from Jeremy, doing everything she could to sidestep another uncomfortable run-in.

At the same time, Liam clung to Marsha as his bargaining chip, refusing to divorce Kayla.

In response, Kayla sought legal counsel, hoping the law could untangle the situation he insisted on prolonging. in the quiet atmosphere of a cafe, Khalid Potter flipped through the documents Kayla had brought."Taking this through legal means doesn't work in your favor right now. Since Cooper Group is still under mortgage,your claim to the groupis significantly weakened. There's a real chance you'l walk away with nothing."

The idea of leaving empty-handed was unacceptable to Kayla. She couldn't let Liam take everything. At the very least, she had to win back what was hers.

"Mr. Potter, if I manage to clear the mortgage on Cooper Group, will that make the divorce easier to negotiate?"

Khalid gave a firm nod. "Yes, that would shift things in your favor."

Once they'd finished going over the details, the lawyer stood and left, leaving Kayla alone with her thoughts.

If she accepted Archie's conditions and joined Newton Group, there could be a path to recovering Cooper Group.

While Kayla considered the possibilities, the cafe door opened. Two women stepped inside, dressed in bold colors and expensive accessories, their laughter trailing behind them.

Tricia scanned the room and spotted Kayla sitting by the window.

Kayla·caught sight of them as well but didn't plan to acknowledge their presence. She paid her bill quietly and rose to leave.

Before she could take a step, Tricia's companion spoke with theatrical surprise. "Well, if it isn't Mrs.Graham."

Kayla turned and immediately recognized the woman-Felicia Bates, one of the staff at Perennia Group.

Back when Kayla still worked at Perennia Group, Felicia had just arrived as an intern. She had trailed after Kayla constantly, eager to impress, playing the part of a loyal sidekick.

Now,Felicia appeared to have switched allegiances, clinging closely to Tricia.

Kayla gave them a flat look, her expression cool and unbothered. THole wasted no fime adopting a friendly front. 'R's been a while. How have things been wlth you?

Kayla's reply cut through the pretense. "You really have to ask? With Liam dragging out this divorce, how do you think I'm doing?"

Tricia tilted her head, her voioe thick with mock sympathy. "But Liam's been good to you. Why fight so hard for a divorce?"

That was enough for Kayla. "Tricia, drop the act. You're the one counting the days tllf we spllf, aren't you?"
Felicia chimed in,"Why even talk to her? Mrs. Graham clearly has too much time on her hands, stirring up drama to get Mr. Graham's attention. Unlike you, she's just playing housewife with nothing better to do."

Kayla gave a dry, biting laugh. The same intern who once clung to her approval now dared to speak this way.

My personal life doesn't concern you," she said with a frosty smile.

She moved forward, closing the distance, until she stood level with them-taller than both, even without heels.

Tricia and Felicia shrank back slightly, their earlier bravado cracking.

"Don't take offense, Mrs. Graham," Tricia said, wearing a sweet smile that didn't reach her eyes. "Felicia was just teasing."

As she spoke, she casually swept her hair to the side, exposing a faint hickey on her collarbone, a not-so-subtle message about where she'd spent the night.

Tricia's shameless attempt at provocation struck Kayla as almost amusing.
She let out a scornful laugh. "No need to show off. I'm not interested in seconds. But if you are, hold on tight -he'll move on the moment someone else catches his eye."	,

Tricia snapped back, "I'll pass that along to Liam. And rest assured, he's in good hands. Let's be honest,without him, what do you have left? He's the reason your grandmother's still alive."

Before the words had time to settle, Kayla seized the coffee cup from the table and hurled its contents straight at her.

The splash Hit Tricia full on, coffee soaked her hair, streamed down her face, and ruined her designer outfit.

Kayla set the empty cup onto the table with a sharp clink, brushed her hands together, and spoke with cold detachment. "Next tlme, don't come alone. Bring Liam, I've got somethning saved for him as well."

She pushed past them without looking back and walked out of the cafe.

Felicia scrambled to Tricia's side, her voice rising in concern. "Tricia,are you hurt?"

Tricia shakily brushed the coffee from her face, her expression twísted with rage.
###Chapter 32 Steal Her For Yourself


In his office, Liam was buried in paperwork when the sound of the door creaking open drew his attention.
Without looking up, he asked, "Did you get a hold of Campbell Group's project lead?"

"Mr.Graham, Tricia is in the lounge."

Liam raised his head to see Felicia standing in the doorway.

His brow furrowed. "Did she finish her task? Why is she in the lounge?"

Felicia shifted awkwardly, clearly conflicted.

"Speak," Liam ordered, his voice sharp.

After a pause, Felicia said, "We ran into your wife downstairs at the cafe. She seemed upset with Tricia.She threw coffee on her."

Liam didn't wait for more. He strode out, heading straight for the lounge.

Inside, Tricia was trying to clean herself up, blotting at the coffee stains on her white blouse.Her shirt was slightly open, black lace peeking out beneath the fabric.

The moment Liam entered, his eyes were drawn to the skin exposed beneath the drenched shirt.

He loosened his tie and took a breath to suppress the heat rising in his chest.

Tricia quickly turned her back, tugging her shirt closed. Her voice trembled with barely held tears.′′Mr.Graham,why are you here?"
-
He ignored her question. "Did you see Kayla?"

Tricia nodded.
 
"What did you say?" e some issues with me."

Liam stepped closer, taking in her disheveled appearance-her damp hair, smudged makeup, and the large coffee stain on her white shirt. "Was this her doing?" he asked.

Tears welled up in Tricia's eyes, though she tried to appear strong. "She accused me of seducing you and even called you a scumbag. I understand if she doesn't like me. It's fine; I'll keep my distance from her in the future."

Oddly enough, Liam felt a trace of satisfaction stir in his chest. If Kayla was so angry-angry enough to lash out and throw coffee at Tricia-then that must mean she still cared.

She still loved him. The thought eased some of the frustration that had been festering within him lately.

"Next time, don't provoke her. Stay out of her way.Understand?"

Tricia kept her gaze down, hiding the resentment in her eyes. "Yes."

He removed his jacket and draped it over her shoulders. "Go home and rest. Come back tomorrow."

He turned to leave, but shé caught his wrist.

Her voice was soft, trembling with desperation. "The power and water are out at my apartment. May I stay at your place tonight?"

Liam paused, torn. He wanted to refuse, but Kayla hadn't been home in days. She'd clearly moved out.

It was just one night. It wouldn't hurt.

"Come to my office later. I'll give you the key."

Tricia's face lit up. "Thank you."

At the care facility, Kayla had just finished a walk with Marsha when her phone rang. It was Archie.

"Kayla, have you made your decision?" he asked. Kayla helped Marsha settle at the table before answering, "I have one condition."

Archie was unfazed. "I'm listening."

She glanced back at her grandmother and lowered her voice. "Give me one month. Pl land the projects you're targeting.If I succeed, I want Cooper Group returned to me."

There was a brief pause. "You're saying you'll only work for a month?" he asked.

"My grandmother's health is deteriorating. I can't commit long-term. Call this a trial."

After a brief silence, Archie agreed. "Deal. After one month, the choice will be yours."

The call ended.

Kayla returned to Marsha, who was watching her curiously.

"Kayla, why hasn't Liam come by lately?"

Even with her fading memory, Marsha still remembered Liam's name.

Kayla's face stayed composed. "He's been busy. But I'll be here from now on.I promise."

The next day, Kayla visited Newton Group to sign her contract. By the time everything was finalized,it was nearly noon.

Archie handed her an envelope. "We're hosting a business gala tonight. It'll be a good chance for you to get to know our network."

Kayla accepted the invitation with a polite nod. "Thank you."

The evening came quickly. The venue buzzed with industry elites, all dressed to impress.

Kayla kept her look simple-a blue evening gown, soft curls, and modest heels. Archie's car dropped her off at the front entrance.

Just as she stepped out, she saw Jeremy and Dewitt arriving together.

Archie exchanged polite nods with Jeremy. As business partners, they kept things civil. Kayla, however, instinctively shifted behind Archie, hoping to avoid Jeremy's gaze.

But Jeremy didn't so much as glance at her. He walked past without a word.

Dewitt, of course, noticed everything. He grinned, eyes gleaming with mischief. "I didn't expect you to be Archie's date tonight."

Archie answered coolly, "Kayla has joined Newton Group. She's part of the team now."

"Is that so?" Dewitt said, his gaze lingering on Kayla a little too long before following Jeremy inside.

Kayla felt her stomach twist. Dewitt's look had been loaded-curióus, amused, maybe even speculative.

Archie gently prompted, "Shall we?"

She nodded and followed him in, lifting the hem of her dress as they entered the grand ballroom.

Inside, Dewitt leaned close to Jeremy. "Your nephew's wife is working for Archie now. Looks like she's serious about cutting ties with Liam."

Jeremy's eyes briefly followed Kayla's figure-poised, elegant, completely untouchable. His voice was flat."What does that have to do with me?"

Dewitt chuckled, clapping him on the shoulder. "Isn't it obvious? This is your chance to steal her for yourself."
###Chapter 33 What The Hell Are You Doing


Jeremy turned, shooting Dewitt a frosty look.

Dewitt responded with a sheepish chuckle, the mischief in his eyes hard to miss. "What? Did I cross a line?
You're really going to pretend there's nothing between you and Kayla?"

Jeremy's voice dropped into a warning chill. "Say another word-you'll regret it."

Dewitt stifled a laugh behind his hand, his shoulders shaking slightly. "Fine, I'll drop it. But with Kayla now on
Archie's team, and you two teaming up so often these days, I'd say there's a good chance you'll be running
into her a lot more."

Jeremy gave no reaction, not a word.

Intrigued,Dewitt leaned closer. "You seriously feel nothing for her?"

Jeremy silently traced the rim of his wine glass, then slipped off the ring from his finger.

The second Dewitt saw it, he spun on his heel and bolted.

After all these years with Jeremy, he'd come to recognize the warning signs. When Jeremy made that move,
it mean he was about to strike. If he didn't make himself scarce fast, he'd be neck-deep in trouble.

Jeremy slid the ring back onto his finger.

Edwin stepped in and spoke. "Mr. Graham,Mr. Campbell just arrived."

"Mm." Jeremy's eyes flicked toward Kayla, who stood at Archie's side.

She appeared completely at ease, slipping into conversation with the surrounding business elites as if she'd belonged in their circle all along-composed, confident, and utterly unshaken.

By the entrance, Liam appeared.

Trailing behind was Tricia, his secretary, wearing a champagne-colored gown and painted with flawless makeup.

Liam's eyes scanned the room and landed on Jeremy, who was hard to miss.

Despite the reluctance, he had little choice-his position demanded he offer a greeting.

"Uncle Jeremy,"he said.

Jeremy gave a cursory glance, his attention sliding briefly to Tricia. He asked flatly, "Didn't bring your wife?"

The question hit like a slap. Liam stiffened. "Kayla's tied up with work, so I came on my own."

Jeremy's expression didn't changed. If anything, his tone turned even colder. "Whatever you do is your business, but don't drag the Graham name through the mud. You're married. Don't give anyone a reason to start talking."

Liam flushed with discomfort. "Thanks for the warning, Uncle. I'll keep it in mind."

Jeremy turned, ready to walk away, but Liam held him back.

Casting a quick glance around, Liam lowered his voice. "Uncle Jeremy, since we're both here1I was hoping to ask a small favor."

Jeremy's tone stayed level. "What kind of favor?"

"I heard Mr. Campbell is looking to work with domestic firms on a shopping mall venture.Perennia Group is pursuing a similar direction. Since you're close with him, maybe you could introduce us?"

The moment Liam finished his sentence, even Edwin shot him a look of contempt.

Perennia Group-a modest firm at best-actually had the audacity to chase a partnership with the esteemed Campbell Group, a titan that stood toe-to-toe with North Investment?

Liam clearly didn't grasp the weight of his own limitations.

Jeremy's sharp face relaxed into a faint smirk, laced with ridicule. "Perennia Group barely clawed its way out of a financial mess, and now you think you're ready to take on a Campbell Group development?"
Liam didn't blink. "Uncle Jeremy, people need to aim forward. Yes, Perennia had a rough patch, but that doesn't mean we've stopped growing. Don't you think?"

Jeremy's tone remained casual, yet every word hit with precision. "A bit of advice-before chasing new deals, settle your debt with Newton Group and reclaim Cooper Group. It's still tied up as collateral, isn't it? If Mr. Campbell finds out your whole company's foundation is your wife's legacy, do you really think he'll entertain a partnership?"

In a single, cutting remark, Jeremy shattered any hope Liam had left.

A feeling of discomfort flared in Liam's chest. He was family, wásn't he? Why was Jeremy so unwilling to lend a hand?

He withdrew to the lounge area with Tricia following close behind.

"What now, Mr. Graham?" she asked, lowering her voice. "We went through a lot just to get invited. We can't walk away with nothing."

Liam snapped, frustrated, "Be quiet. If I want something, I'll find a way to get it."

Tricia gestured across the room. "Mr. Campbell is over there."

Zane was approaching Kayla, his wife and child beside him.

"Why is Kayla here?" Liam muttered in surprise, his thoughts flashing to that unique ring he'd once seen on her finger-the one that had belonged to Zane. Kayla appeared to share a close rapport with Zane.

Tricia slid her arm through his, voice sweet. "Why don't we go say hello together?"

"Stay here. I'll go alone." He shrugged her off and walked toward Kayla alone.

Tricia didn't want to accept it, but all she could do was stand by and watch him walk over to Kayla.

"Kayla, it's been a while. You look amazing tonight." Zane and Kelley were just then arriving to greet Kayla.

Kayla crouched to ruffle the boy's hair, her voice gentle. "Thank you. That's very kind of you."

"Here you are! I've been searching everywhere for you." Liam appeared out of nowhere, slipping an arm around Kayla's waist and pulling her firmly against him.

Startled, Kayla stiffened, then tried to shove him off.

But Liam only tightened his hold, determined not to let her slip away.

Zane and Kelley exchanged a glance before turning to Kayla with amused curiosity."Kayla, may we ask who this gentleman is?"

Liam spoke with quiet confidence as he tucked a loose strand of Kayla's hair behind her ear."Hello,I'm Liam Graham-Kayla's husband and the CEO of Perennia Group."

"If you're her husband, then you're a friend of ours." The Campbells immediately warmed up to him.

Kayla stomped her heel down on his leather shoe, leaning in and whispering, "Liam, what the hell are you doing?"
###Chapter 34 What Happened That Night


Liam pressed his lips against Kayla's ear and murmured without a hint of shame,"Just play along, will you?|need to discuss business with Mr. Campbell."

Kayla shot him a look of pure disbelief. "And why would I do you that favor?"

Even now, he couldn't stop using her.

Instead of backing off, Liam pulled her closer until there was barely any space between them.

His voice dropped to a hushed murmur."lntroduce me to Mr. Campbell. If I can close a deal with him tonight, I'll agree to any one condition you name."

Kayla arched an eyebrow, not missing a beat. "Even a divorce?"

Liam's jaw tensed. For a moment, he looked ready to argue, but then, he nodded. "Yes. Even that."

A cold, cynical laugh slipped from Kayla's lips. "Afte everything, you think I'd actually buy that?"

Liam faltered, then tried again, his tone gentling, almost coaxing. "Kayla, Perennia Group is ours-something we built together from scratch. All this success,it should mean something to both of us. Even if you're not in charge anymore, we're still married. We're still a team."

Kayla had heard it all before. Empty promises, recycled assurances-none of it moved her anymore.

From a distance, the pair looked like a couple sharing a tender moment, locked in each other's arms,their closeness painting a perfect illusion for anyone watching.

Jeremy watched the entire exchange from across the room, swirling his wine with an air of detached interest.

Standing beside him, Edwin glanced at his boss before commenting."Looks like Kayla and Liam have patched things up." "Stay out of it!" Jeremy snapped, then pivoted and strode off.

Edwin stayed behind, his brow furrowed in confusion. What was Jeremy thinking when he told him that?

if it wasn't his concern, why had Jeremy been staring at Kayla for so long, ignoring everyone else who tried to greet him?

On the other side of the room, Liam wasted no time dragging Kayla into his schemes, eagerly drawing Zane into friendly banter.

"I have to say, your husband's quite the catch. You two look made for each other." Zane and his wife smiled at Kayla.

"Thank you. Kayla and I go way back-we were each other's first love. Five years together, and we've always been inseparable." As he spoke, Liam tried once more to pull Kayla into an embrace. But she nimbly sidestepped his arm, slipping just out of reach.

Liam laughed off her evasiveness without a trace of embarrassment.′′She′Sa little shy when it comes to public displays of affection."

The Campbell couple chuckled, convinced Kayla and Liam were the picture of marital bliss.

Liam seized the moment, eager to ingratiate himself."Mr.Campbell, why don't we head over there and have a real conversation?"

Watching the smug curve of Liam's lips, Kayla fought the urge to wipe that expression off his face.

Beneath his polished facade, he was a complete fraud, always performing for an audience.

Murmuring a polite excuse, Kayla slipped from the group and made her way toward the restroom.

As soon as the door closed behind her, she gripped the edge of the sink and drew a shaky breath.

Something in her body felt off, a subtle unease twisting in her stomach. Maybe it was the sliver of cake she'd nibbled on earlier.

She stared at her reflection in the mirror: delicate features, lips with a natural blush, teeth bright as pearls. But the eyes that met her gaze were clouded with uncertainty, a shadow of confusion flickering in their depths.

Liam would never agree to a divorce without a fight. How much longer would this exhausting battle drag on?

After collecting herself, Kayla smoothed her hair and stepped out of the restroom. As she crossed the garden, a familiar silhouette caught her eye-a lone figure seated in the pavilion ahead.

If she wanted to reach her destination, she would have to pass by.

Kayla faltered for a moment, uneasy about seeming impolite by not greeting him.

But before she could make up'her mind, a woman in a blush-pink dress strolled over to him.

Kayla froze mid-step and quietly slipped back into the shadows.

Zoe, curves accentuated by her designer dress and expensive handbag swinging from her wrist, greeted Jeremy with practiced charm.

Her tone was honeyed, her smile deliberately sweet. "Jeremy, I really appreciate you inviting me tonight.Everyone's been so welcoming. I've already made some new friends."

Jeremy looked her way, cool and unreadable, but he didn't rebuff her.

Thanks to Edwin's thorough investigation, he was nearly certan this woman was the same one from that night.

That alone compelled him to treat her with more consideration than usual.

When Zoe asked him to bring her to the banquet, Jeremy hadn't hesitated. He saw it as a matter of responsibility-something he couldn't shirk.

"There are plenty of people worth knowing here," he replied, his voice even but distant. "Networking's important."

Zoe spotted a bottle of wine on the table and moved closer, her movements fluid and calculated. "Thank you for this opportunity." As she poured him a glass, the deep V of her dress dipped, offering an unobstructed view of her delicate collarbones and the alluring line of her chest.

Aware of Jeremy's distaste for overpowering fragrances, Zoe had deliberately chosen a rose-scented bath earlier, leaving her skin with only the faintest trace of roses-a gentle, natural aroma that lingered softly in the air.

The subtle scent wrapped the space in a soothing warmth, barely noticeable, yet undeniably pleasant.

Yet when Jeremy showed no reaction at all, Zoe grew uneasy, worrying the scent might be too light. She subtly closed the distance between them,hoping he'd notice.

"There's really no need to lean in just to pour me a drink," Jeremy remarked, his tone calm but unmistakably distant.

Zoe drew back immediately, her eyes lowered in compliance. "I know you're always busy. That's why l treasure every moment I get to spend by your side."

Jeremy didn't answer, absently swirling the wine in his glass, his expression unreadable.

Sensing an opening, Zoe pressed on. "My parents have been hoping to invite you to dinner. They wanted to apologize for last time-when our meal got cut short so unexpectedly."

The previous dinner had ended poorly due to Kayla's unexpected arrival.

Zoe fidgeted anxiously, her heart thudding as she waited for Jeremy's answer.

After a few seconds of silence, he nodded. "You can set it up."

A bright smile broke across Zoe's face. "Thank you. My parents will be over the moon."

Nearby, Kayla caught every word. She couldn't help but sneer inwardly-Jeremy had completely fallen for Zoe's act, convinced she was the woman from that night. Zoe wasn't shy about seizing the opportunity; she and her mother really were experts when it came to manipulation.

While Kayla mulled it over, Jeremy's deep voice interrupted her thoughts. "Zoe, do you remember what happened that night?"

Zoe's fingers hesitated over the fruit she was peeling, a flicker of unease passing through her eyes."Why are you suddenly asking about that night?"

"You don't want to answer?" Jeremy's brow furrowed.

Zoe looked away, lowering her head as if bashful, her fingertips toying nervously with the hem of her dress."Oh,that night..."

Jeremy probed further, his gaze unwavering."Wat happened that night?"

Her face grew even redder. "You were so passionate that I could hardly walk the next day."
###Chapter 35 What If | Said | Wanted To Be Your Girlfriend


Kayla felt a surge of disgust twist in her chest.

How could Zoe lie so shamelessly?

Jeremy turned to Zoe, her cheeks burning with shyness. Questions crowded his mind. "Why did you disappear after that night?"

Zoe scrambled mentally for an excuse, then settled on a sweet, innocent look. "I was scared. I didn't know who you were then. I was afraid you'd blame me or that my parents would find out. I thought it would be safer to keep quiet."

"You don't need to be afraid." Jeremy's voice softened. "If you ever need anything, just tell me.I'll help however I can."

Zoe's eyes sparkled. She opened her mouth to speak, then hesitated.

Jeremy caught the flicker of doubt in her eyes. "If there's something on your mind, go ahead and say it."

Her heart pounded. Testing the waters, she asked, "What if I said I wanted to be your girlfriend? Would you say yes?"

The air went still.

Jeremy didn't respond.

Kayla, watching from nearby, instinctively stepped forward, ready to unmask Zoe's lies. But she stopped herself.

She clutched a pillar for support, her emotions in disarray.

She could see it clearly now-Zoe and her mother were trying to manipulate Jeremy. If she stayed silent,he'd continue to be misled.
But if she spoke up, how would she explain her own involvement?

Her heart twisted in conflict.

Zoe's cheerful voice broke through her thoughts."t's settled then-tomorrow afternoon at Lakeside Dream,you'll join my parents and me for lunch."

Jeremy nodded."Alright."

Just then,Edwin approached. "Mr. Graham, Mr. Newton is requesting your presence."

"Got it." Jeremy stood. Then, turning to Zoe, he added, "You should come too."

Zoe's eyes lit up. She practically beamed with excitement."Of course!"

The idea of accompanying Jeremy thrilled her. Maybe this meant she was special to him.

As Jeremy walked off, his gaze drifted to the shadows behind a nearby pillar.

A sliver of a woman's dress was just barely visible.

He lingered for a second,then turned and left.

Only after they were gone did Kayla step out of hiding.

She'd meant to leave earlier, but Archie's secretary came looking for her.′′Mr. Newton would like you at the front hall for the banquet's opening."

"I'll be right there," she replied.

On her way down the corridor, Kayla accidentally collided with a passing waiter. The tray in his hands clattered to the floor.

Kayla bent to help. "I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to."

The waiter kept his head down."|t′Ssfine," he muttered, before hurrying away without another glance.

Kayla watched him go, confused. The banquet was in full swing. Why the rush? Shaking off the thought, she continued on.

The front hall buzzed with music and laughter. Couples mingled under soft lights.

Jeremy stood with Zoe beside him, while Liam was accompanied by Tricia, who clung to his arm like ivy.Even the Campbell couple were in attendance.

Kayla,by contrast, was alone. She found a quiet spot along the edge of the room and watched the host speak from the stage.

Noticing her isolation, Archie approached. "You don't look like you're enjoying the evening. Everything alright?"

Kayla offered a faint smile. "I'm fine,"

He nodded subtly in Liam's direction. "I saw your husband's here too. Is he giving you trouble?"

Her smile faded. "No. When a marriage reaches this point, even making eye contact makes me sick. It's easier to keep our distance."

Archie chuckled, hands tucked in his pockets."Can't say I've ever been married, but | understand the feeling of wanting to escape. Still, that kind of freedom doesn't come overnight. You'll need patience."

His words were kind, and Kayla felt a flicker of gratitude.

She asked, "You've never been in a relationship, have you? You wouldn't know what it's like to be shattered by someone you once loved. That ache-it never really goes away."

"I've never dated, but I have loved someone." A shadow passed over Archie's face.

Kayla regretted her words instantly. "I'm sorry. That was too personal."

Archie gave a soft smile. "It's alright. We're adults-we know how these things go."

Just then, the host announced it was time for Archie's speech.

A spotlight cut through the room, landing on them. Kayla froze.She'd hoped to remain unnoticed, but now every eye was on her.

"Who's that stunning woman next to Mr. Newton?" someone whispered.

The murmurs spread quickly.

Across the room, Liam's expression twisted with rage. His fists clenched, eyes locked on Kayla

Tricia noticed. "Why's your wife with Mr.Newton? Do they know each other?"

Liam didn't answer, but his jaw tightened.

Jeremy glanced over at the sudden attention, then looked away, uninterested.

Suddenly, a shriek rose from the crowd.

"Oh my God! My earrings are gone! Has anyone seen them?"
###Chapter 36 Jeremy Defending Her


Just then, a well-dressed woman, the wife of a prominent businessman, began frantically seaching the floor.

The atmosphere shifted as curious glances spread through the crowd.

Given the wealth gathered at tonight's gala, even a pair of earrings could be worth a small fortune.

Archie, the host of the event, stepped forward calmly."Do you remember where you last saw them?"
The woman, flustered and clearly upset, gestured toward a lounge area. "I went to the restroom and left my earrings on the sofa, thinking I'd pick them up when I returned. But when I came back, they were gone!"

A ripple of murmurs passed through the guests. No one could believe someone would steaI at such an upscale event.

"Those earrings cost me millions," the woman said bitterly. "Whoever took them is a disgrace."

Kayla couldn't believe anyone would casually leave something so expensive unattended.

As Archie motioned for security to review the camera footage, a server leaned in and whispered something in his ear.

Archie's gaze shifted, briefly landing on Kayla.

Nearby, Jeremy watched the interaction intently, his expression unreadable.

Dewitt nudged him. "Is it just me, or does it look like Kayla is about to get accused?"
-Moments later, the server pointed to Kayla and raised his voice. "This woman was near the sofa earlier.Maybe she took them!"

Kayla's heart pounded. She hadn't expected to be dragged intothis.

Jeremy's brows drew together as he scanned the crowd, visibly unsettled. Archie held up a hand. "Let's not make assumptions. We'll check the security footage first."

But the woman wasn't convinced. She turned to Kayla with narrowed eyes. "Did you fake my earrings?"

Kayla held her ground."No,I didn't."

"Then let us search you," the woman insisted. "If you've got nothing to hide, what's the problem?"

Kayla let out a short, disbelieving laugh. She knew how it would look-letting them search her was tantamount to admitting guilt.

"If you're innocent, a quick search shouldn't bother you," Tricia chimed in, her voice dripping with faux concern.

Kayla stepped forward, glaring at her. "You want a show? Fine. Search away. I've got nothing to hide."

Without hesitation, she unzipped her purse and upended its contents onto the nearest table.

The crowd leaned in, hungry for drama. Tricia was practically glowing with anticipation.

Dewitt smirked at the spectacle. "Think we'll find the earrings?"

Jeremy shot him a cold loók. "Enough."

Kayla raised her voice, eyes scanning the crowd. "Take a good look. Are the earrings here or not?"

The woman rushed forward and began rifling through the pile like she was at a clearance sale.

After a tense moment, with every eye on her, the lady held up.a pair of earrings.

Her voice was sharp with triumph."Look at these!"

Gasps echoed around the room. Tricia feigned shock,pressing a hand to her chest. "Kayla, how do you explain this?"

Kayla turned pale. She stared at the earrings in disbelief. She had never seen them before in her life.

Her mind raced, trying to make sense of it. Then it clicked-she remembered the server she had bumped into earlier. Could he have slipped it into her bag?

Before she could speak, the woman seized her arm. "You're so young, yet already stealing? Who are you?How did you even get into this event?"

Kayla opened her mouth to explain, but the risingchorus of jeers drowned her out. The word "thief" rang through the room like a slap.

Tricia sidled up to Liam, whispering with a grin,"It's hard to defend her now. Looks like she's guilty."

Liam said nothing, Instead, he stepped between Kayla and the accuser. "How much are the earrings? I'll pay for them."

Kayla recoiled,furious. His gesture only made her look more guilty.

"I don't need your help," she snapped, shoving him aside.

"Kayla, don't escalate this," Liam urged. "These aren't people we can afford to cross. Let me pay, and it'll end here."

Her laugh was bitter and scornful. "So just because they were in my bag, I'm automatically guilty? Why are you so eager to throw me under the bus?"

The woman sneered. "Still denying it? Fine-I'm calling the police!"

Tricia, still playing the part of the concerned onlooker, chimed in, "Kayla, don't you realize how embarrassing this is for Liam? If word gets out that his wife's a thief, it'll ruin his reputation."

Kayla's stomach churned at the hypocrisy.

Archie finally stepped in. "I trust Kayla's character. There's likely been a misunderstanding."

Tricia folded her arms. "If that's true, then prove it. But until then, someone explain how that earrings got into her bag."

Kayla's eyes locked onto Tricia's with a steady, unblinking stare. She said nothing, but her silence carried weight.

The room quieted, though the whispers continued like smoke around her.

Then, á deep, clear voice broke through the tension. "I've been sitting by the sofa all night. And I didn't see Kayla touch a thing."
###Chapter 37 Kayla's Hand Struck His Face


The crowd stilled, all eyes turning to the speaker.

Jeremy stood there. Though not under the spotlight, his presence commanded attention.
His posture was effortless, yet imposing-hands in his pockets, his tailored suit emphasizing every inch of his sharp, statuesque frame. There was a quiet authority about him that made the room hold its breath.

Kayla turned slowly, her eyes locking with his.

She hadn't expected him to speak up for her.

Liam caught the exchange and stiffened, annoyance flaring in his chest.

He was just about to push through the crowd to reach Kayla when Tricia clutched his arm. "Don't go.Don't drag yourself into this."

Liam hesitated, jaw clenched, but stayed where he was.

Dewitt stood behind Jeremy, chuckling. "That's right. Jeremy and I have been sitting by the sofa all evening.Not once did we see Kayla take your earrings. Perhaps you've misunderstood her."

The accusing woman's face paled. These weren't men one could casually provoke-they heId weight in Trark that few could riv/al.

"If Mr. Campbell and Mr. Newton say so, then I must have been mistaken. I sincerely apologize."

With Jeremy speaking up, no one dared argue.

Kayla met Jeremy's gaze and offered a faint, grateful smile. Jeremy didn't respond. He gave her only a brief look before turning and walking away, his expression unreadable.

Later,Archie came over to reassure her, urging her not to take the incident to heart.

The gala wrapped up quickly after the incident. Respect for Jeremy's word smothered any lingering gossip. When Kayla stepped out of the hotel, her phone rang. It was Liam."l′mn outside," he said flatly.

She walked to the curb and saw his car idling nearby.

Liam was in the driver's seat, cigarette in hand. Tricia was in the front passenger seat, casually scrolling through her phone.

Tricia rolled down her window, her smile sly and saccharine. "Kayla, do hurry. Liam's been so patiently waiting for you."

Kayla's eyes narrowed with disdain. She looked past her to Liam."Since you're already playing chauffeur for Tricia,Iassume you two have a cozy evening planned. I won't interrupt. Say what you need to say, then let's be done with this."

Liam crushed his cigarette and shot Tricia a glare."Out."

Tricia's smile slipped, but she obeyed, slipping into the back seat without a word.

Liam looked at Kayla again. "Now will you get in? Or would you rather argue in front of the entire hotel?"

People nearby were already watching. Kayla, face cold and unreadable, climbed in.

The moment her door shut, Liam slammed the gas pedal. The car jerked forward, and Kayla nearly hit her head on the dashboard.

They tore through the city streets at a reckless pace. Kayla clenched her fists, swallowing against the nausea rising in her throat.

Finally,Liam pulled over on a quiet, deserted road. The car idled in the silence-tense, stifling.He turned to her, fury crackling in his voice. "I had no idea you were was so tight with Jeremy and Archie. When did that happen?"

It wasn't a question; it was an accusation.

Liam had been simmering with rage all night, and now it spilled over.

Kayla met his glare coolly. "I'm still a Graham, aren't I? Your uncle spoke up to protect the family name. Don't be so childish."

Liam let out a bitter laugh. "You're so charming, you can make even Mr. Campbell play your white knight.Why stop there? Why not sweet-talk Jeremy and Archie into helping me too?"

Before he could say more, Kayla's hand struck his face.

The slap cracked through the car like a whip, sharp and final.
###Chapter 38 Thought I'd Make You Share A Bed


Liam felt the sting burning against his cheek. Kayla threw open the car door and stepped out without a second glance.

He tightened his jaw. "You sure about this?"

Kayla shot him a glare, her voice cold. "Just get lost."

Fuming, Liam slammed the gas pedal and sped off, tires screeching.

Left alone by the roadside, Kayla suddenly doubled over as a sharp pain stabbed her stomnach. She crouched down, clutching her abdomen, breath shallow with agony.

In the rearview mirror, Liam caught a glimpse of her pained expression. He scoffed, assuming it was a ploy to guilt-trip him. His anger flared."Kayla, quit trying to get under my skin," he muttered,pressing harder on the gas.

From the back seat, Tricia watched the drama with a smirk. Once they were far enough away, she chimed in,"This is in the middle of nowhere. Forecast says a big storm's rolling in. You sure it's okay to leave Kayla out there by herself?"

Liam didn't answer.

The car disappeared around a bend.

A flash of lightning lit up the sky, followed by a deafening boom of thunder. Then the rain came, torrential and unrelenting.

Kayla stood soaked and shivering on the empty road, with no shelter in sight.

A few cars zipped past, none slowing down.

In that moment, whatever lingering affection she'd had for Liam vanished. Then, headlights pierced the downpour, blinding her. She raised her hand to shield her eyes.

A sleek car pulled up beside her. The window rolled down.

Through the downpour, she saw a strikingly handsome man, his features sharp even in the dim light.

"Get in," Jeremy said coolly from the back seat.

The rain was falling too hard for hesitation. Kayla climbed in without a word.

Warm air from the car's heater wrapped around her like a blanket, melting the chill in her bones.

From the passenger seat, Edwin turned and handed her a towel. "Please, dry off."

"Thanks," Kayla replied, dabbing her wet hair carefully, not wanting to drip on the upholstery.

Jeremy sat silently beside her, his presence intense and charged with something unspoken.

After a moment, Kayla spoke softly. "Thank you for letting me in."

Jeremy looked over at her. "Liam really left you out there?"

Kayla nodded and turned to the window. The road they were on led straight to the Cooper family's estate.Jeremy must've just dropped Zoe off; or he wouldn't have been passing through.

"Can you drop me at the next intersection? I'll wait out the rain and call an Uber," she said.

Jeremy didn't respond. When she glanced at him, his eyes were closed-either resting or asleep.

Edwin's phone buzzed. He took the call, then turned to Jeremy."Sir, there's been a landslide ahead. The road's blocked. We'll need to wait it out."

Jeremy opened his eyes, unfazed. "Find a hotęl nearby. We'll stay the night and head back once the road's clear."

"Understood."

They pulled into a nearby hotel, where Edwin went inside to check in. He returned a few minutes later with a keycard.′′MrA.Graham, your room's ready, but..."

"But what?" Jeremy asked, raising an eyebrow.

Edwin looked at Kayla with a hint of regret. "The road closure brought a crowd. All other rooms are taken.I couldn't get one for Kayla."

Kayla shrugged. "It's fine. I'll call an Uber and take a different route."

Jeremy interjected, "No one's coming out in this weather. Unless you're planning on hiking, that's not happening."

Kayla fell silent. Walking wasn't an option. But staying?

"There's space in my room," Jeremy said, already moving toward the elevator.

Kayla froze.His room?

Edwin smirked as he leaned toward her. "Most people would kill for a chance to bunk with Mr. Graham.Count yourself lucky."

Kayla's stomach twisted. Sharing a room with Jeremy? That felt dangerous.

She followed them hesitantly. But when they entered a two-bedroom suite, she exhaled in quiet relief.

Discreetly, she wiped sweat from her brow.

Jeremy turned to her, voice smooth and teasing."You look nervous. What, thought I'd make you share a bed?" ###Chapter 39 Vomiting


Kayla gave a timid smile. "I wouldn't dare. Thank you, Jeremy, for letting me stay tonight."

Jeremy glanced over at her soaked appearance. His tone was flat but not unkind."Go inside and clean up."

"Alright." She dipped her head and quietly slipped into one of the rooms.

As the door clicked shut behind her, Jeremy turned and stepped out into the hallway.

Edwin approached. "Mr. Graham, I overheard what happened. Liam and Kayla got into a huge fight in the car. He kicked her out-left her stranded in the rain."

Jeremy arched a brow. Thinking of Liam's recent behavior, he wasn't surprised. No woman could endure that kind of humiliation forever. Kayla wanting a divorce made perfect sense.

Worried that the rain might make her sick, Kayla quickly tooka hot shower and put on a thick bathrobe.

Even a mild illness could jeopardize her or the baby's health.

Only then did she take in her surroundings.

The suite was exquisite-lavish furnishings, plush carpeting, and soft, ambient lighting. A place like this must cost thousands a night. It was a world far removed from hers.

Her phone vibrated on the nightstand where it was charging.

She walked over and saw Liam's name flashing on the screen. Without hesitation, she declined the call and blocked his number.

Tossing the phone aside, she lay down on the oversized bed. But moments later, her stomach growled.Normally, she would've ignored the hunger. But now she had another life to nourish.

Still wrapped in the bathrobe, she padded to the door and cracked it open cautiously.

Jeremy, seated at the desk outside, looked up as the door creaked. Their eyes met. Embarrassed, Kayla froze in place.

He had clearly just showered too-his dark hair damp and neatly combed, his robe cinched tightly around his trim frame. The quiet confidence he exuded made her all the more self-conscious.

"Hi," she greeted, flustered. Her voice was barely above a whisper.

Jeremy gave a slight nod."Hungry?"

Caught off guard, she blinked. "How did you know?"

"You barely touched your food at the dinner party. Then you spent an hour in a thunderstorm. Of course you're hungry."

"I was thinking of heading out to find a restaurant. There's probably one still open nearby, right?" As Kayla spoke,she started heading for the door.

Jeremy's voice cut through the air, cool and pointed. "At this hour? Everything's closed. I already had Edwin grab something before the shops shut down. But if you're set on wandering around in a bathrobe,be my guest."

She stopped in her tracks, cheeks burning. "No, that's fine.I'll stay here."

A few.minutes later, Edwin returned, balancing a tray with three sandwiches and a small assortment of fruit.

"MAr. Graham, this was all I could scrounge up. Most places were already closed."

Jeremy gave a curt nod, then motioned for him to stay."Join us."

Kayla sat down and reached for a sandwich. But after one bite, her face paled. She lurched to her feet and bolted to the bathroom. From inside came the unmistakable sound of retching.

Jeremy,who hadn't even touched his food, shat a look toward the bathroom,startled.

He frowned and turned to Edwin.11|ssomething wrong with the food?"

Edwin raised his hands defensively."NO, sir. I picked it up from a trusted place. They wouldn't dare mess with the food." Another wave of gagging and vomiting echoed fromn the bathroom.
###Chapter 40 | Needed Somewhere To Hide


Kayla waited for the nausea to settle before cleaning herself up and stepping cautiously out of the bathroom.

The living room was quieter now-Jeremy sat alone at the table. Edwin had disappeared

Feeling awkward, she approached slowly and took her seat. "I'mn sorry. I haven't been feeling well today."

Jeremy's expression remained unreadable, his handsome features impassive. "If you're not feeling well, eat a little and get some rest."

"Alright." Kayla didn't dare touch the sandwich again, worried he might connect her nausea to something more than just an upset stomach. Instead, she sipped water and nibbled on a few pieces of fruit to settle her stomach.

As she stood to leave, she hesitated. "Thank you for speaking up for me tonight."

Jeremy's cold gaze lifted. "No need to thank me. You're part of the Graham family, and protecting you protects our reputation."

"Liam's never been that considerate," Kayla muttered under her breath.

"What was that?" Jeremy's brows drew together.

She quickly smiled and shook her head. "Nothing. I'll head to bed now."
Just then, Edwin burst back into the room, a pharmacy bag in hand and a proud grin on his face. "Mr.Graham,I found some medicine at the front desk. Picked up a few things for Kayla-thought it might help."

Kayla's eyes landed on the bag, her heart skipping a beat.

This wasn't just a cold. She was pregnant. How could she take random medicine?

"Here you go," Edwin said as he strode over and handed her the bag. "Thank you, Edwin," she said quickly, taking the bag and retreating to her room before either man could say more.

"You're welcome!" Edwin replied cheerfully. But as he turned around, he froze under the weight of Jeremy's icy stare. The air between them turned cold.

Edwin gave a sheepish chuckle. "What? Why are you looking at me like that?"

Jeremy's tone was razor-sharp. "Since when did you become so thoughtful?"

Edwin raised his hands in mock surrender. "Just being helpful. She's your nephew's wife, after all."

"Get out," Jeremy ordered.

Edwin didn't argue, "Got it. Rest well, sir." He slipped out the door, letting it click shut behind him.

Jeremy remained still, his gaze shifting toward Kayla's closed door, his expression unreadable.

Kayla tossed and turned all night, unable to fall asleep. Though exhausted, sleep eluded her.

The thought of Jeremy-just on the other side of the wall-kept her mind racing. Never had she imagined being this close to him again.

Finally, unable to take the restlessness, she flipped on the lamp and stepped out onto the balcony for some air.

The silence outside was soothing, the cool breeze brushing her skin and calming her nerves.

Then she heard it-a faint sound from the neighboring balcony.

Startled, she grabbed a flowerpot for protection, eyes straining in the dim light."Who's there?"

A shadow moved. Slowly, a figure emerged from the darkness.

As it drew closer, she realized it was Jeremy.

Her eyes widened."What are you doing out here?"

He didn't answer right away. His face was shadowed, but the irritation in his voice was clear. "You're awake too."

Before she could respond, he stepped onto the railing and vaulted onto her balcony with effortless ease.

Kayla stumbled back in shock, clutching the flowerpot tighter. "Are you out of your mind? What are you doing?"

He took a few steps forward, then stopped, keeping his distance. His expression softened slightly."I needed somewhere to hide."

"Hide? From what?" she asked, retreating toward the door.

In her panic, she caught her foot on the frame and lost her balance.

Jeremy moved in a blur, catching her around the waist. The momentum carried them into the glass door with a soft thud.

Suddenly,she was pressed against his chest, his arms firm around her. Her breath caught.

As she looked up, her lips brushed against his chin. The moment froze-tense, breathless, and silent. All she could hear was the rapid beat of their hearts.

A flush crept up her neck.

Before she could pull away, a woman's voice echoed from the neighboring room. "Where's Mr. Graham?Why isn't he here?"

Jeremy moved instantly, switching off the balcony light, plunging them into darkness.

Leaning close to her ear, his breath warm against her skin, he whispered, "Don't make a sound."

Kayla stiffened. She didn't understand what was happening, but his serious tone left no room for argument.She stayed perfectly still, heart pounding, her entire body on edge.

The woman's voice grew louder. "We agreed I'd be spending the night with Mr. Graham. Where could he have gone?"
###Chapter 41 Women Arranged By Dewitt


Kayla perked up her ears, listening carefully, her thoughts spinning with the thrill of overheard drama.

It wasn't exactly common for women to show up looking for Jeremy at such a late hour.

And from the sound of it, there weren't just one but two voices, now drifting in from the balcony.

Jeremy had taken Kayla to hide behind the balcony door. When he looked down, the faint light caught her face,alive with curiosity and quiet excitement.

He let go of her and raised a hand, signaling for silence.

Kayla gave a slight nod, barely breathing as she complied.

The two women next door, failing to locate him, finally decided to leave.

Kayla steadied herself, pressing down the flutter in her chest before whispering,"Who were those women?Why were you hiding from them?"

Jeremy strolled over to the sofa and dropped into it. "They were sent over by Dewitt. I came here to stay out of their way for a while."

Kayla's question came out too fast. "Sent over for what?"

Jeremy threw her a look, sharp, unmistakable.

What did she think this was, a late-night board game?

Her face tightened as she caught herself. "That was rude of me," she murmured, voice low with regret.

She stepped aside, putting space between them.

As she moved, Jeremy's eyes followed the curve of her waist and the length of her legs.

That moment earlier, when their bodies had brushed, had sent a heat through him he hadn't expected. And something about her tugged at him-maybe it was the shared bloodline with Zoe, the resemblance lurking just beneath the surface.

Jeremy studied her for a beat before asking, "You and Zoe share the same father, right? You probably know her pretty well."

Kayla's voice was flat. "I moved out years ago. We're not that close. If you're trying to get information about her, I'm not the one to ask."

"Are you aware of what'sgoing on between Zoe and me?" Jeremy asked.

Kayla hesitated, a vivid flash of that unforgettable night playing across her thoughts.

After a pause, she lifted her head. "No, not really."

"Okay." With no answers to draw from her, Jeremy said nothing further.

His attention shifted to the paper bag sitting on the table, the medicine Edwin had brought earlier. Judging by its untouched state, Kayla hadn't taken any of it.

He frowned inwardly. Edwin had gone out of his way, and for what? She clearly didn't need it.

Just then, Kayla's face twisted, and she clamped a hand over her mouth to hold back a sudden wave of nausea.

The movement caught Jeremy's eye, and he watched her closely.

Kayla fought through the queasiness and quickly motioned to the door. "I need to lie down. You should go."

Jeremy's jaw tensed, irritation flickering across his features.

Being turned away wasn't something he was used to.

With an icy expression, he turned on his heel and left.

At the door, he paused, lifting his arm for a quick sniff. Nothing out of the ordinary.

He'd just showered and changed,so why had she looked so sick? The moment the door shut behind him, Kayla rushed into the bathroom and bent over the sink. Though nothing came up, her stomach knotted painfully.

With a tender hand resting on her belly, she muttered, "Sweetheart, next time you see your father, try not to get too excited. If he ever finds out about you, we're in serious trouble."

The following morning, Kayla rose early, her hunger nudging her out the door in search of food.

The hotel's restaurant was quiet, with only a few guests scattered at different tables.

She ordered pancakes and a bowl of creamy mushroom soup, then settled in at a small table. Just as she lifted her spoon, Jeremy and Dewitt appeared, striding in together.

Dewitt headed straight for her and slid into the seat across from hers.

"What are the odds? We keep bumping into each other. Heard you spent the night in Jeremy's suite. Sleep well?" His tone was playful, his expression even more so.

Caught off guard, Kayla glanced toward Jeremy before answering, "I only stayed for the night. I'm grateful to him for letting me."

Dewitt gave a thoughtful nod, his grin widening. "So that's why he turned down the company I arranged.Had a beauty waiting for him already."

Kayla coughed suddenly, soup catching in her throat.

Jeremy stepped in at that moment, delivering a swift kick to Dewitt's leg as a warning.

Instead of joining her, Jeremy picked a table a short distance away.

Wincing,Dewitt reached down to rub his leg before rising from his seat. "Just having a little fun. Don't take it to heart. Jeremy, come on-we're all friends here. No need to keep your distance."

He finally walked off to join Jeremy, and Kayla exhaled quietly, lowering her head as she focused on her meal. Once she finished eating, she gathered her belongings and slipped out of the restaurant without lingering. "Good morning, Kayla." Edwin appeared at the entrance, a sleek shopping bag from a high-end perfume boutique dangling from one hand.

Kayla nodded politely, but as she passed, she caught Edwin mutter, "That's odd. Mr. Graham never wears cologne.What made him want a bottle now?"
###Chapter 42 Drive Liam Away


Once the storm passed, the weather began to improve, and repairs soon began on the road that had been damaged.

Jeremy instructed Edwin to drive Kayla home.

Upon arriving, she got out of the car, waving Edwin off as his black car eased into the distance.

Just as Kayla turned to go inside, Liam appeared from the entrance.

His glare was sharp, almost predatory.

Kayla acted as if he weren't there and strode quickly toward the entrance.

Liam moved in front of her, blocking the door with a stiff arm and snapping, "Who dropped you off? Where were you last night?"

Kayla stopped and gave him an icy look. "Since when do I owe you explanations? You didn't hear me asking who kept you company last night."

The anger simmering in Liam finally spilled over. He jabbed a finger in her direction, his voice rising."I know you're seeing someone. You ignored my calls and vanished for hours. Just remember-you're still my wife.Don't make me lose it."

"That's ridiculous," Kayla said with a sudden burst of laughter.

Her radiant smile lit up her face, effortlessly captivating anyone who saw her.

Liam stood there, flustered and humiliated, yet unable to release the frustration boiling inside him.

"What's so damn funny?" he barked.
Kayla turned to him, her expression flat and unfeeling. "Liam, the moment you left me alone last night,we're done. Just be reasonable and handle the divorce paperwork. You're impossible to deal with." "Kayla,how dare you speak to me like that!" Liam snapped, his fury boiling over as he lifted his hand to strike her.

Kayla didn't flinch. Her stare held steady, daring him to go through with it.

Liam hesitated, his arm frozen in the air, then slowly lowered it, seething. "Don't test me, Kayla. You won't like where that leads."

Kayla brushed past him, her expression blank, each step carrying the weight of resolve.

Furious, Liam lashed out, slamming his foot into a flowerpot and watching it topple.

Back at home, Kayla changed outfits and left for Newton Group.Unwilling to give up, Liam tailed her car and parked outside the building like a shadow that wouldn't leave.

Archie's assistant approached her with a raised brow. "Kayla, isn't that your husband's car?"

Kayla stepped up to the window, her eyes landing on the car idling quietly by the curb.

She turned back and said, "Tell security to remove him."

"He's been warned multiple times, but he wouldn't listen."

Frustration churned inside Kayla. Liam was being utterly disgraceful, disturbing her work without shame.

"I'll speak to him myself," she muttered, heading for the elevator.

"Kayla." Archie's voice came from behind as he exited his office.

She paused and gave him a polite nod."Mr.Newton."

Having concluded the meeting, Archie dismissed the team and walked over to her. "What's the rush?" he asked.

She didn't bother to sugarcoat it. "There's someone downstairs causing a scene. I need to get rid of him."

Archie wasn't clueless; he had a good idea of who it was.

He straightened his tie with a calm hand and gave a nod. "Focus on your tasks. I'll arrange for someone to take care of everything else."

Kayla offered a sincere nod of appreciation. "Thank you, Mr. Newton."

Outside the building, Liam's car sat amidst a mess of cigarette butts, but he remained unmoved.

He leaned against the window, eyes locked on the building, still reeling from the shock that Kayla had actually landed a job here-and somehow even caught Archie's attention.

A sudden burst of water struck his face, making him flinch.

He spotted two security guards spraying the pavement with hoses and quickly stepped out of the car to confront them. "What do you think you're doing?"

One of the guards answered evenly,"Sir, we're just clearing the trash from the street."

Liam's expression soured. Were they calling him trash?

His eyes flicked to the badges on their uniforms-Newton Group. He realized immediately that they wouldn't dare pull this stunt without backing from higher-up.

He quickly changed his approach. "I'd like a word with Mr. Newton."

"Mr. Newton is currently occupied. Please schedule an appointment. If you don't move your vehicle, we'll have it towed."

Humiliated but unwilling to create a public scene, Liam climbed back into the car and drove off in silence.

From an upper floor, Kayla watched the car disappear down the street, the tension in her brow slowly easing.

She turned and rapped gently on the CEO's office door.

"Come in." Archie glanced up from the stack of files as she walked toward his desk.

"Liam's gone. Thank you, Mr. Newton."

He gave a curt nod. "Get ready-we're heading to North Investment for a meeting." Kayla hesitated before speaking. "Mr. Newton, wouId it be possible for someone else to attend in my place?"
###Chapter 43 Ridiculed By Liam's Mother


Archie looked up at Kayla, his expression softening. "You don't want to go?"

She shook her head, gesturing toward her desk. "I haven't finished my tasks yet. I can't relax until I do."

A gentle smile played on Archie's lips. "It's fine. I'll let you finish them later. For now, come with me to North Investment-I need your help."

His tone was kind, but there was no room for negotiation. Kayla nodded reluctantly and followed.

She hoped she wouldn't run into Jeremy this time.

Twenty minutes later, they arrived at the headquarters of North Investment. Unfortunately, fate wasn't on her side.Jeremy was already in the reception room, waiting for them.

Kayla stood slightly behind Archie, instinctively trying to make herself smaller,invisible.

Jeremy,seated with casual authority, glanced her way briefly, then turned away.

"Shall we begin discussing the project?" Archie asked.

The two men launched into a detailed discussion, the kind that required no input from Kayla, who stood by patiently.

She had worn heels today-poor planning. After some time, her calves ached with the familiar, dull burn.

Archie eventually turned to her. "You can sit, Kayla. We're all friends here-no need to stand the whole time."

"Thanks, Mr. Newton. I'll just step out to the restroom first."

As she exited the room, Jeremy's gaze followed her for a brief moment before turning away.

Once outside, Kayla felt her breathing ease considerably. She stood in the hallway, taking deep breaths.

Several employees passed by, their tailored suits and confident steps echoing the building's modern grandeur. This was a place for people who belonged.

Kayla stopped in front of a wall-mounted promotional board, eyes drawn to a familiar face.Jeremy's photo was displayed prominently, a unique presence.

He might have been born into privilege, but he'd built this empire through sheer force of will. He didn't just inherit influence-he commanded it.

Suddenly, a sharp female voice sliced through her reverie. "What are you doing here?"

Kayla turned to see a striking woman in a fitted black suit standing nearby. Janiya-Liam's mother.

Janiya looked barely over thirty despite being well into her forties, adorned in luxury from her earrings to her heels.

"Ms. Graham," Kayla greeted casually.

She noticed Janiya holding a luxurious gift box, seemingly here to ask Jeremy for a favor. Janiya always held herself in high regard, and for her to personally seek help, it must be related to Liam.

Janiya stepped forward, scrutinizing Kayla's face. "You haven't even divorced Liam yet, and you're already this cold to me?"

Kayla's voice was even. "We'll be divorced soon."

Janiya sneered. "Don't play dumb. I know all about you and Liam's issues. A man stepping out once or twice isn't the end of the world. You need to learn to be more forgiving. Do you really think you can just come and go from the Graham family on a whim?"

Kayla's reply was razor-sharp. "Funny. I heard Liam's father had a fling with a salon worker, and you used the Graham name to ruin her. If you couldn't tolerate betrayal, why should l?"

Janiya's eyes darkened. "You've become so disrespectful."

"This is between me and Liam. I'd advise you not to interfere." Kayla turned to leave.

A passing employee held a tray of coffee. Without warning, Janiya snatched a cup and splashed it across Kayla's face.

"You wouldn't even be allowed in this building if it weren't for the Graham name!" Janiya spat, turning on her heel and striding away.

Kayla stood still, coffee dripping from her chin, her shirt clinging damply to her skin.

The employee quickly offered her a pack of tissues and asked with concern, "Ma'am, are you okay?"

"I'm fine. Could you tell me where the restroom is?" Suppressing the storm inside her, Kayla took the tissues and walked off, her pride held together by sheer willpower.

The restroom was full, so she found a quieter hallway with a floor-length mirror and began dabbing at her shirt.

Jeremy had already finished his meeting with Archie. Now, he was in the lounge, sipping coffee. He loosened his tie, picked up his coffee, and turned casually to the window. His gaze caught on a familiar figure outside.
###Chapter 44 Pull Her Collar Open


"No wonder a mother like that raises a son like this," Kayla muttered bitterly, dabbing furiously at the coffee stains on her blouse. No matter how hard she scrubbed, the marks wouldn't budge.

With a frustrated sigh, she continued rubbing, unaware of the fact that the mirror she was using was a one-way mirror.

On the other side, Jeremy sat watching. The mirror concealed him perfectly, allowing him to see every fidget,every movement she made.

"Ugh, it's still there. I've got that meeting with Mr. Newton. What am I supposed to do now?" In her irritation,Kayla pulled her collar open to get better access to the stain. The motion inadvertently revealed the edge of her black bra.

Jeremy caught a glimpse of her ample chest-and choked on his coffee. He coughed violently, nearly spewing the drink.

Trying to regain composure, he quickly poured himself another cup, forcing hs gaze away from the mirror.Still, the image lingered in his mind.

How could she be so careless? So indecent? In the middle of the day, no less!

"Mr. Graham?" Edwin's voice echoed through the door.

Jeremy panicked and lunged for the remote, locking the door before Edwin could come in.

From the hallway, Edwin called again, sounding confused. "Sir? Is everything alright?"

Loosening his tie, Jeremy replied hoarsely, "I'm busy. Come back later."

"Understood."
Meanwhile, Kayla gave up her efforts on the stain and began freshening up. The coffee that Janiya had spilled earlier had smudged her makeup, and now she carefully retouched it, still unaware of her observer. Drawn as if by instinct, Jeremy approached the mirror. From his side, her image was crisp-rosy lips pursed in concentration, hands delicately applying concealer. She looked like a fragile bloom: graceful, alluring,completely unaware of her effect.

He watched silently, mesmerized, until she sighed and dropped her compact back into her purse.

"Forget it. I'll deal with it later." She turned, and her reflection faded as she walked away.

For the briefest moment, a flicker of warmth touched Jeremy's usually unreadable face. The corner of his mouth tilted into something like a smile.

Just then, the lounge door opened and Edwin entered, catching Jeremy standing alone, staring blankly.′′MGraham? What are you doing?"he asked,puzzled.

Jeremy's demeanor turned cold instantly. "What do you need?"

"Janiya's here," Edwin said. "She's looking for you."

Back in the reception room, Kayla found Archie's assistant waiting with the finalized contract. Everything had gone smoothly.

Archie glanced at her stained blouse. "What happened there?"

Kayla.gave a sheepish smile, hand instinctively covering the marks. "Just spilled some coffee-nothing major."

Archie stood and slipped off his suit jacket. "Next time, be more careful," he said, handing it to her.

Startled,Kayla waved her hands."Oh,no. Mr. Newton, really, that's not necessary."
Archie insisted kindly, "I know how important it is to look polished in our line of work. Just wear it. It's no trouble."	ン

Reluctantly, Kayla accepted the jacket, offering a grateful smile.

They stepped out of the room just as Jeremy passed by with his team.

"Mr. Graham, I'm heading out. Here's to a successful partnership," Archie said, extending a hand. Jeremy's eyes flicked to the jacket draped over Kayla's shoulders. His handshake was firm, but his tone was chilly. "To a successful partnership."

Archie nodded and walked on, Kayla following. As she passed Jeremy, an unexplainable chill ran down her spine.

His voice cut through the air. "Did you run into Janiya earlier?"

Startled, Kayla turned."Yes."

"She didn't cause trouble?"

Kayla hesitated. "No. We've never exactly gotten along."

Jeremy said nothing more and strode away, his cold demeanor like a wall shutting out further conversation.

When the door to the CEO's office opened, Janiya quickly rose from the sofa. "You're finally done," she said with a practiced smile.

Jeremy didn't spare Janiya a glance as he walked to his desk and sat down, his expression as frosty as ever."I've told you not to come unless it's urgent."

Janiya approached the desk, her usually proud face now filled with humility. She placed the gift box she had brought in front of him. "I brought this back from my trip. It's a local specialty. You've been working hard-l thought itmight help."

Without even glancing at it, Jeremy shoved the box aside. His eyes narrowed. "I don't need meaningless gestures. You know I don't like you."

Janiya wrung her hands nervously, her voice softening. "I understand. But I'm still your sister. The past is behind us-family should support each other."

Jeremy's gaze didn't soften. "Take your things and leave."

Janiya stayed rooted. Forcing a smile, she added, "If this is about how my mother interfered with your parents' marriage, I'm sorry. I was young-l didn't understand. But we're blood, Jeremy. We should move on."
###Chapter 45 Jeremy's Girlfriend


"Out now!" Jeremy lifted his head, his eyes bloodshot with fury.

Just then, Edwin stepped into the officeand spoke to Janiya with firm restraint. "You should leave now."

Janiya stood her ground, determined to speak her mind. "Jeremy, we're family. Couldn't you do something for Liam? Hle's struggling."

Jeremy offered no reply, his face unreadable.

Edwin motioned to the security team, who proceeded to escort Janiya out in a manner that left no room for dignity.

In the hallway, her argument with the guards grew heated. In the scuffle, a cup of coffee splashed across her dress, leaving a glaring stain. Seething with rage, she stormed off.

Back inside, Jeremy picked up the gift she had brought and dropped it into the trash without a second thought.

Edwin gave a small nod. "Mr. Graham, she's left."

Jeremy dabbed at his hands with a tissue, his tone sharp and cold. "If someone like her ever makes it in again, we'll be finding a new head of security."

Outside the building, Kayla was about to get into the car with Archie. Her eyes caught sight of Janiya being escorted out, her appearance in complete disarray.

Leaning lightly against the car window, Kayla's lips curled with quiet satisfaction.

She remembered all too clearly the hardships she had endured because of Janiya. Watching Janiya's current predicament was undeniably satisfying.

Archie caught the slight smile playing on her lips and tilted his head. "What's got you smiling like that? Mind letting me in on it?"
Kayla quickly regained her composure and shook her head."It's not important. We should get going, Mr.Newton."

At Perennia Group, Liam was deep in a meeting when the office doors flew open and Janiya barged in,visibly seething.

He promptly dismissed the others and hurried over to his mother. "Mom, what's going on?"

Janiya hurled her designer handbag onto the couch and dropped into the seat, her tone sharp with frustration. "Liam, you can't imagine the disgrace I suffered at Jeremy's office today. I'm a Graham, and he tossed me out like I was nothing. He wouldn't even let me finish speaking!"

Liam exhaled, clearly exasperated. "Mom, Jeremy's never been fond of us. Why do you keep going to him?"

Her voice dropped into a more urgent tone. "If I don't intervene now, Perennia Group won't survive. I've already heard the rumors-you're knee-deep in a cash flow crisis. Just look at what's become of the company under your watch. If I hadn't gone to Jeremy, everything would be over."

Liam scoffed, his expression brimming with self-assurance. "We're not going under. I've already reached out to Mr. Campbell's team. We're in talks about a project. Once the funding comes through, we'll be back on track."

Janiya blinked in surprise. "You got through to Mr. Campbell? I thought he was impossible to reach. How did you manage that?"

"No need to be concerned," Liam said with a shrug, purposefully leaving out the fact that Kayla had opened the door for him. With a few noncommittal remarks, he sidestepped Janiya's probing.

Lowering her voice and leaning in, Janiya tugged Liam closer. "Guess who I ran into at North Investment?"

"Who?" Liam asked, his tone flat.

"Your wife!" Janiya declared with theatrical flair, gesturing animatedly. "Kayla was there, bold as ever! Isn't that odd? How does someone like her even gain access to a place like that? Do you think she's using her looks to sway Jeremy?" Liam remained unfazed. "I already know. She's with Newton Group now, and they've always collaborated with North Investment. It makes sense that she'd be there."

Just then, Tricia entered, balancing a cup of coffee. Her pink dress clung to her figure, accentuating every curve with deliberate elegance.

Smiling sweetly, she offered the cup to Janiya. "Please, enjoy some coffee."

Janiya accepted it wordlessly, her expression momentarily tight as she cast a dismissive glance at Tricia.Then,turning her focus back to Liam, she said, "Kayla's come far. Now even Archie's in her corner."

Liamn let out a bitter chuckle. "I misjudged her."

Tricia chimed in, "There's something you might not know. Kayla's sister is dating Jeremy now."
###Chapter 46 Prenatal Checkup
"Are you serious? Where did you even hear that?" Liam and Janiya stared at Tricia, both visibly stunned.

Tricia offered a sly smile. "Just some whispers floating around. But think about it-every time Jeremy shows up at a banquet lately, Zoe's there too. It has to mean something."

Liam frowned, mentally retracing recent events.Jeremy had been unusually quick to defend Kayla on several occasions. If it was because of Zoe, then it all made sense. It wasn't about any romantic entanglements.

Janiya, on the other hand, gripped his hand tightly,her voice urgent. "Liam, you can't divorce Kayla now."

Tricia's smile faltered, but she held her tongue.

Liam exhaled wearily. "Mom, I never wanted a divorce.Kayla's the only one I've ever loved. Do you know how much we've been through just to get here?"

Janiya threw a pointed glance at Tricia. "You should get back to work."

The message was clear. Tricia straightened her blouse,masking her hurt with a polite nod before quietly leaving the room. As the door clicked shut, Janiya leaned in, her tone low and serious. "I don't care how many women you've fooled around with in the past. This is different. If we want to secure the Perennia Group's future, you need to lock down Kayla's loyalty. She has ties to both Jeremy and Archie. That's leverage we can't afford to waste."

Liam's jaw tightened. "Mom, I've told you-I love her.Stop meddling. I'll handle it myself."

Janiya snorted. "You love her? Then what was Tricia,a phase? Spare me the talk about love-men throw that word around too easily. I've lived long enough not to be fooled."

Liam flushed,her blunt words hitting a nerve. "Enough,Mom. I'll take care of it. You should go home."

"If you don't get Kayla back, there won't be a company to save." WVith that, Janiya swept out of the office.

Left alone, Liam stared at a framed photoon his desk -he and Kayla during their university days, smiling,happy. How had it all unraveled so badly?

Just then, Tricia reentered. Seeing him fixated on the photo made her stomach twist. "Liam? What's wrong?"she asked gently.

He snapped out of it, his voice distant. "Nothing."

She moved toward him and wrapped her arms around his waist, her voice soft and reassuring. "Whatever happens-divorce or not-I'll always be here for you."

His expression darkened. Memories of Kayla's accusations of betrayal during their arguments surfaced in his mind.

Abruptly, he pushed Tricia's hands away.

She blinked,stunned. "What's wrong?"

Liam stepped aside, waving her off. "Make a reservation. I'm taking Kayla to dinner tonight."

Tricia's heart sank, but she forced a smile. "Alright. I'll take care of it."



"Ah-choo!" Kayla sneezed, sitting at her desk as evening fell. She reached for a tissue, rubbing her nose and glancing out at the darkening sky.

It was nearly seven. Most of her colleagues had already left, but she wanted to stay a little longer to finish her work.

Her phone buzzed with a notification. It was a reminder from the hospital app-her prenatal checkup was coming up.

She stared at it, one hand instinctively brushing over her stomach. With everything going on, she'd nearly forgotten.

"Kayla? You're still here?" Archie passed by,noticina Checkup the light still on in her office.

Quickly locking her phone, she stood. "I just have a few things left to wrap up. I'll be heading out soon."

Archie walked in, offering a kind smile. "There'll be more work tomorrow. I don't want my team burning out. Go home and rest."

"It's alright. I'll leave by 7:30-just need a bit more time."

Seeing her resolve, he nodded. As he turned to leave,he paused and looked back. "By the way, your planning insights have been excellent. I want you on the team managing our collaboration with North Investment. Since you already know Jeremy,it should be a natural fit."

Kayla's smile froze. She had been trying to keep her distance from Jeremy, but now she was being drawn right back in.

"Great. I'll introduce you to the team tomorrow."Archie took her silence as agreement. With that, he left.

Kayla sank back into her chair, exhaling heavily."Great. Now everything's ruined."
###Chapter 47 Play The Sympathy Card
At exactly 7:30, just as the security guard was preparing to lock up forthe night, Kayla slipped out of the building in the nick of time.

He offered her a gentle, fatherly smile. "If you ever end up working late again,let me know ahead of time.Wouldn't want you getting stuck inside."

"Thank you, sir," Kayla murmured as she stepped into the evening air.

With a conspiratorial grin, the guard gestured toward the curb. "Your husband has been waiting out there for quite a while now."

Kayla halted as she spotted Liam emerging from his car,a bouquet of fresh flowers resting in his arms.

She didn't budge, her features frosted over as she regarded him in silence.

Tonight,Liam looked nothing like his usual imposing self. The harsh edges of his presence had vanished,leaving only a quiet gentleness behind.

For a fleeting moment, Kayla was swept back to their school days-memories of Liam waiting for her outside the classroom every afternoon,always holding a bright bundle of flowers. Her friends had watched with envy, whispering that she must be the luckiest girl in the world to have someone so thoughtful at her side.

After college, Liam had gone against Janiya's wishes and stubbornly insisted on marrying Kayla. Back then,their classmates couldn't stop gushing about what a catch he was-a golden boy who seemed to have it all.

As Liam drew closer now, Kayla shook herself free from the haze of nostalgia. The memories were golden, almost too bright to bear, but that happiness belonged to another life. There was no going back.

"Kayla, congrats on your new job. I brought these for you," Liam remarked, his voice warm as he held out the bouquet with a hopeful smile.

Kayla refused to take the flowers. Her tone turned icy as she demanded, "Liam, what are you doing? Are you really putting on another show?"

"I just wanted to pick you up from work, that's all." His smile faltered, but he forced sincerity into his voice.

Kayla turned away, a scornful smile curving her lips."So, what is it this time? Need me to cozy up to some big shot again?"

Liam's chest rose as he inhaled sharply. When he met her gaze again, he looked almost wounded. "Kayla,we've been through so much lately. I know l've messed up, but I swear, I'm trying to do better. I reserved a table for us-let me take you to dinner." "Save it." Kayla brushed his hand aside, sending the bouquet tumbling to the pavement.

The flowers hit the ground in a vivid spray of petals.As they scattered, a small bottle slipped free and rolled until it bumped against the tip of Kayla's shoe.

She glanced down, catching the label-Liam's familiar stomach medicine.

Liam's stubbornness with his medication had always been a headache.Even back in school, Kayla used to chase him down just to make sure he took it. After marriage, nothing had changed-she still had to practically force the pills into his hand.

Her eyes met his with a frosty, indifferent stare. "Are you seriously trying to play the sympathy card now?"

Dropping his gaze, Liam let out a hollow, humorless laugh. He stooped to pick up the small bottle,weighing it in his palm with a strange tenderness. "This was the first bottle you ever handed me.I never had the heart to throw it out. I've just been refilling it all these years. But if you're walking out on me now,what's the point in holding onto it?"

Without another word, he flicked the bottle into the trash.

Kayla's expression didn't waver. "What are you up to this time, Liam? Trying to guilt-trip me into staying?"

Just then, a sleek black Rolls-Royce glided down the street. Seated inside, Edwin leaned forward and urged the driver to pull over.

Peering out the window, Edwin pointed ahead."Mr.Graham, isn't that Kayla and Liam up there?"

Jeremy, who had been resting with his eyes closed,cracked one eye open and followed Edwin's gaze.

On the sidewalk, Kayla and Liam stood opposite each other, their postures stiff, the distance between them thick with tension.

Without warning, Liam pulled Kayla into a desperate hug, anguish written all over his face as he pleaded with her.

Edwin couldn't hide his nosy curiosity. "You think Kayla might actually forgive him?"

Jeremy cut him off with a frosty glare that made the air inside the car drop a few degrees.

Edwin swallowed his next words'and sank quietly back in his seat, instantly silenced.

Jeremy's attention returned to the unfolding scene just in time to see Kayla shove Liam away and jab a finger at him, her voice sharp with reproach.

Suddenly, Liam crumpled to the pavement, his features twisted in agony. Kayla hurried to support him,hauling him into her car before speeding off.

Jeremy watched in stony silence, not blinking until their car vanished around the corner. Only then did he speak, his tone low and steely. "Drive."

Meanwhile, Kayla's foot pressed harder on the accelerator, tires humming as the city blurred by. She shot Liam a sidelong glance, her tone clipped."Should I take you to the hospital now?"

Liam shook his head, skin clammy and eyes strained.He pointed weakly toward the windshield. "It's too far.Go straight, then turn right. I keep some medicine nearby."

A sigh of impatience slipped from Kayla's lips. If not for the last, stubborn trace of guilt, she might've dumped him on the curb the moment his stomach twisted in pain.

Liam's gaze softened, lingering on her face."Kayla,do you remember back in college? Whenever I had a stomachache, you always rushed over. I can't forget those days."

Kayla pressed two fingers to her temple, the irony grating. There was a time she would've melted at his sentimental routine. Now, his nostalgia barely registered.

Liam tried again, voice gentle. "Kayla, do you remember-"

"Say another word and I'll make sure you can't speak for a week." With a screech of brakes, Kayla swung the car up to the curb outside a small restaurant. "Call someone for your medicine. I'm done here." She barely finished the sentence before a sudden,thunderous "bang" shattered the air overhead.
###Chapter 48 Is Your Wife Pregnant
Colorful confetti fluttered down all around Kayla,dusting her hair and shoulders in a sparkling cascade.

She flinched instinctively, squeezing her eyes shut But when she realized it was only the aftermath of a confetti cannon, she snapped them open and fixed Liam with a sharp glare. "Have you lost your mind?Maybe you need to get your head examined!"

Liam, who'd been moping just moments before,suddenly straightened, a hopeful glint sparking in his eyes. He hurried out of the car to stand beside her."Kayla, I brought you here tonight because I owe you an honest apology."

Kayla's patience snapped. "Liam, is making a fool out of me your new hobby?"

Before she could stalk away, the restaurant doors swung open. The staff, dressed in cheerful, party-bright uniforms, filed out in a procession, each carrying a single vibrant rose.

Kayla huffed in disbelief, shaking confetti from her hair and darted straight for the exit.

"Don't go yet. Let's just have dinner, all right?" Liam grabbed her arm and steered her inside, leaving her no chance to protest. He'd booked out the entire restaurant for the evening,decorating it with streamers and fresh flowers. The long table in the center sparkled beneath the lights,covered with an extravagant array of dishes.

"No drama tonight, okay? Just relax and enjoy the meal," Liam insisted, grinning as he piled slices of tender meat onto her plate with almost childlike enthusiasm.

The rich aroma hit Kayla like a wall, turning her stomach. She pressed a hand to her lips, fighting back a surge of nausea.

"This is your favorite dish, isn't it? Eat up tonight-l ordered extra for you." Liam, oblivious, beamed as he ladled a generous helping into her bowl.

The sight of the glossy, fatty meat made Kayla's stomach revolt. She bolted upright and darted toward the restroom.

Startled, the servers scrambled aside as she brushed past, her heels clicking urgently across the floor.

Liamn gaped after her, stunned by her abrupt reaction.

A waiter, hesitant but curious, leaned over and whispered,"Sir, could it be that your wife is expecting?"

Liam's face hardened. "That's ridiculous," he snapped,his voice laced with irritation.

They had never shared a bed. How could she possibly he preanant? Yet,retching was certainly something that could hint at pregnancy.

A storm cloud passed across Liam's features as he began to entertain the idea.

Inside the restroom, Kayla leaned over the sink,heaving until the wave of nausea finally ebbed.

She splashed cold water on her face, staring at her reflection-her eyes clouded with worry. The sudden bout of sickness rattled her. Had Liam noticed anything unusual?

Steadying herself, she gripped her purse, drew in a deep breath, and strode back toward the table.

Liam glanced at her anxiously. "Kayla, are you not feeling well?" he asked, concern etched into his brow.

With a measured calm, Kayla set a small box of medicine on the table and eased into her seat. "My stomach's been acting up. Greasy food just doesn'tsit well with me right now."

Relief flickered across Liam's face as he spotted the box-her explanation put his worries to rest.

He immediately turned the lighter dishes in her direction, eager to please. "Here, try some of these instead. I shouldn't have ordered so many heavy dishes tonight. Next time, I'll be more careful."

Kayla lifted her fork and poked at her food, feigning a few polite bites. Every so often, she watched him from beneath her lashes, making sure he wouldn't catch on to her charade.

Trying to bridge the growing distance between them,Liam reached for an old memory. "Kayla, remember those food stalls we used to visit? The grilled fish was your favorite. The owner's opened up a proper restaurant now. He invited us over the other day.What do you say I take you there tomorrow?"

But nostalgia had lost its power over Kayla. Whatever warmth she once felt for him had long since cooled.

She shook her head, her voice quiet but resolute."Work's keeping me busy these days. You should go without me."

Unwilling to give up, Liam pressed on with a hint of forced optimism. "Then I'll just wait until you have time.Newton Group's such a big company-they must treat their employees well. I'm sure they'll give you some days off eventually."

Kayla's icy stare lingered on him, her lips pressed into a thin line as she said nothing.

Just then,Liam's phone started to buzz on the table,vibrating insistently. He glanced at the screen,his jaw tensing when he saw Tricia's name flashing. With a quick swipe,he silenced the call.

The moment the phone went still, it started ringing again. Irritated, Liam snatched up the device and stood, muttering, "It's work. Eat without me. I'll be back in a minute."

Kayla caught the lie instantly. She let out a faint,derisive smirk, too weary to bother exposing him.

Stepping away, Liam asked in a low, scolding voice,"Tricia, do you have any idea what I'm dealing with right now? Why are you calling?"

On the other end, Tricia's trembling voice spilled through the line. "Liam, I slipped in your bathroom. I'm bleeding.Please,can you come home?"

He pinched the bridge of his nose, frustration flickering across his face. "I can't leave now. Go to the hospital. Get someone to help you."

"But it really hurts!" Tricia sobbed, her cries growing louder as a servant's muffled reassurances sounded in the background.

Gritting his teeth, Liam relented, snapping,"Fine.Stay there. I'm on my way."

He turned, mentally scrambling for an excuse. But before he could even speak, Kayla looked up at him,her gaze sharp and unyielding. "Since when has Tricia been living in our house?"
###Chapter 49 Liam's Mother And Grandfather Arrived
As Liam drove Kayla toward the villa, a knot of anxiety.twisted in his stomach.

Back at the restaurant, he hadn't been able to give her any real answers. Worse yet, he had no clue how she'd discovered that Tricia had already taken up residence in the home they once shared.

Kayla sat quietly in the passenger seat, her expression composed as her eyes followed the scenery rushing past the window.

Liam kept hesitating, casting furtive glances her way again and again. When the car rolled to a stop at the next red light, his restraint gave out. "Tricia's place had a leak," he said quickly. "She didn't have anywhere else to go, so I let her stay at the house for the time being. But I rarely go there. Since you left, I've been staying with my mom."

Kayla said nothing.

Liam stole another look at her, his voice more cautious this tíme. "Kayla, are you angry?"

Kayla turned to him, her striking features hard and cool. "That house? We bought it together. I'm not even going to get into how much I poured into the design. I covered the down payment. I paid for all the renovations. Tomorrow, make time to transfer the money back. As far as I'm concerned, that house no longer has anything to do with me."

Her words hit him like ice water. Panic rose in Liam's chest. "Come on, don't be like that. If you're upset about Tricia, I'll tell her to leave today."

"This isn't about whether she stays or goes. I'm done,Liam. I want a clean break. Is that clear?" Kayla's lips remained still, but inside, she scoffed. If not for the message Tricia had sent-parading around in her clothes, right there in the home that used to be hers -she wouldn't have even known the mistress had already settled in.

Kayla's unwavering stance only fueled Liam's frustration. He stomped on the gas, sending the car hurtling down the road in a burst of reckless fury.

When they finally pulled up in front of the house,Kayla flung the door open and stepped out-only to immediately double over and vomit.

She knew exactly what had happened-Liam,that bastard, had done it deliberately.

"Liam!" Tricia came rushing out of the house, her steps clumsy, her voice shrill. She threw herself into his arms without hesitation.

Caught off guard, Liam tried to pull away, but Tricia clung to him, her arms wrapped tight around his waist.
 
Kayla took in the scene before her-a carefully staged display of affection. Tricia, draped in a nightgown with her hair spilling over her shoulders, clung to Liam tightly.

"Kayla, what brings you back?" Tricia pretended to notice Kayla just then, shrinking back from Liam's embrace with a timid and apologetic demeanor.

"Go ahead." Kayla's tone was ice as she cast them a cutting look, then walked into the house without another word.

Liam shot Tricia a hard glare, jaw clenched, before trailing after Kayla in silence.

Once they were gone, Tricia brushed away her tears,a sly flicker of malice gleaming in her eyes.

Upstairs, Kayla stepped into the master bedroom and froze.Clothes were tossed carelessly across the bed and sofa, while the vanity overflowed with Tricia's cosmetics and accessories. Her own belongings had been dumped like garbage.

A wave of fury crashed over her. She snatched the ashtray from the table and flung it at the wall. It struck the wedding photo above the bed, cracking the glass and splintering the frame.

She had once believed that photo marked the start of her happiness forever. Now, she'd tear it all down with her own hands.

"Ah!" Tricia cried out, startled by the chaos as she stepped into the room. Kayla didn't even flinch. She was a storm in motion,smashing every last trace of her wedding memories.Even the photos tucked away in the closet were torn from their frames and hurled to the floor.

Liam lunged toward her. "Kayla, what are you doing?Stop!"

She shoved him back with a force fueled by rage.Her voice cracked through the room. "I won't let my pictures rot in this filthy house. Did you two lie here together,laughing at them? Did it excite you?"

"I know I messed up-badly," Liam pleaded,desperation etched in every word. "Please, don't do this. I'll tell Tricia to leave right now."

Suddenly, Tricia darted across the room, collapsing at Kayla's feet. Gripping her hand, she sobbed uncontrollably. "This is my fault. Not Liam's. Please don't punish him. I'll kneel, I'll bow-whatever it takes to make things right."

Blood seeped from her knees as she sobbed, her shoulders trembling with every bow.

Liam stood nearby, tense and silent, his brows drawn together in unease.

Kayla remained still, unmoved by the display. Her silence was louder than any words.

"I'm sorry," Tricia whispered, her face streaked with tears.Then her body gave out, and she slumped to the  floor,unconscious.

A surge of panic gripped Liam. If anything happened to Tricia, the blame would fall squarely on him. His voice shot out in alarm, "Call 911! Now!"

The noise grated on Kayla's nerves. With the last photo shattered at her feet, she turned away and walked out without a word.

The staff in the hallway stood frozen, not daring to speak. Their eyes followed her, filled with quiet sympathy.

Kayla kept her eyes forward, unfazed by their stares,and was just about to step out when a group of people entered through the front door.

A servant informed them that Liam's mother and grandfather arrived.
###Chapter 50 I'll Accept Whatever Punishment Yo...
Johnny,who seldom stepped beyond the confines of his home, made an unexpected appearance that caught everyone off guard.

Though well into his seventies, he radiated warmth and a seasoned sharpness.Energy coursed through him,and in his eyes-so similar to Jeremy's-rested the quiet command of someone long accustomed to power.

He was once hailed as a titan in the corporate arena,but over time,he had gradually withdrawn,passing the reins of the family businesses to his only son,Jeremy.Still, whispers persisted about friction between the two.

Kayla froze where she stood as they drew closer,knowing instinctively this wasn't the moment to slip away.

She gave a composed nod and said, "Good evening,Mr. Graham."

Their paths had last crossed at the wedding; this marked only their second meeting.

Johnny studied her for a brief moment, then offered a nod. "Quite some time has passed, hasn't it?" From inside the house, Liam caught the stir and burst out, clearly rattled. "Grandpa, Mom, what brings you here?"

Johnny took a slow look around the villa and asked,"What was that racket a moment ago?"

Shifting uncomfortably, Liam replied, "It's nothing serious, Grandpa. Just a minor disagreement between Kayla and me."

Johnny didn't respond. He had heard more than a few tales about Liam, but he'd learned to let such talk drift past him.

Janiya walked up to Liam, her voice lined with mock disapproval as she clutched his arm. "Liam, your grandfather doesn't visit often. You should've come out to welcome him. That's completely inappropriate."

Liam lowered his head, voice apologetic. "I apologize.I should've been more mindful."

With a slight nod, Johnny, steadying himself on a servant's arm, moved toward the sofa.

As Janiya scanned the disorder inside the bedroom and caught sight of Tricia sprawled on the floor,her expression darkened. She yanked Liam aside and said between clenched teeth,"Clean this up. It took a lot to bring your grandfather here. Don't let this fall apart."

"| know, Mom," Liam said quietly.

He turned to the staff, directing them to help Tricia Fit and summon a doctor, making sure nothing disturbed Johnny.

Standing nearby, Kayla watched the mother and son act concerned, her stomach turning. Clearly, they were ashamed to let Tricia be in Johnny's presence.

"Liam, Kayla, come," Johnny called from the living room.

Liam gave a quick nod and stepped forward, but Kayla stayed where she was.

Janiya reached out and grabbed her arm and said sharply, "Kayla, listen to me. My father's the head of the Graham family. He values dignity above all else.Be careful what you say around him."

Kayla shot back, voice laced with bitterness, "It's your son who's dragged the family through the mud.Yet here you are, lecturing me."

Janiya's expression tightened. "Watch yourself. My father's heart isn't strong. If something happens and he gets sick, Jeremy won't let you off the hook."

At the mention of Jeremy, a flick of emotion passed through Kayla's eyes.

"That's enough, Mom," Liam said firmly, tugging Kayla forward, though she resisted with every step.

The servants brought out drinks and light refreshments, then quietly exited, pulling the villa doors shut behind them. Just as Liam moved closer to Johnny, a sudden roar broke the silence. "Kneel!"

The command jolted Liam. He dropped to the floor,knees hitting the marble with a loud thump.

Kayla,watching from the side, had to admit-Liam wasted no time showing submission in front of his grandfather.

Johnny reached for the cane resting nearby and brought it down hard across Liam's back. "Look at what you've done. You've brought shame on yourself and the family. Kayla wanted a real future with you,and this is how you repay her? There's no place in this family for someone like you."

Kayla's brow creased at Johnny's words.

She had only seen Johnny once before, and like Janiya,he had seemed dismissive of her upbringing.

She assumed the Graham family would welcome her separation from Liam, but now Johnny stood up for her, and she couldn't quite make sense of it.

Lowering his head, Liam murmured, "Grandpa, I understand. I'll accept whatever punishment you see fit."

Janiya rushed forward, eyes glossy. "Dad, if someone must take the blame, let it be me. I failed to raise him right. All of this is my fault."

Johnny responded by striking Liam again,the repeated
 Fit blows draining the color from his face. Liam clenched his fists, clearly in pain, but said nothing.

Kayla remained indifferent, silently observing the performance. She knew Janiya wouldn't have brought Johnny here without a motive.

While she stood unmoved, Johnny turned to her and signaled with his hand. "Kayla, I know you've endured a lot. Come please."
###Chapter 511 Heard Jeremy's Seeing Your Sister
At Blossom Estate, Jeremy's private villa, the night air was pierced by Edwin's hurried footsteps as he entered, his expression anxious. "Mr. Graham,your father went to Liam's place unexpectedly. He's been inside for over half an hour now and hasn't come out."

Jeremy,fresh from his shower, sat at the coffee table in a jet-black bathrobe that emphasized his striking features. His long, deft fingers moved with practiced grace as he brewed a fresh pot of coffee, the deicate aroma swirling between them.

He lifted his head, dark eyes glinting with quiet curiosity. "My fathe's health has been fragile. He barely leaves the house these days. Why would he suddenly go out tonight?"

Edwin relayed the details he'd managed to uncover."I'm not sure what Janiya said to him, but after speaking with her, he rushed out to see Liam. They're still over there. I've also heard that Kayla is present.From what the servants are saying, there's shouting-possibly even a physical altercation."

Jeremy's hand stilled above the coffee pot, tension tightening his jaw, though he said nothing.

Edwin pressed on, his tone more urgent."Do you want to check it out yourself? Janiya isn't exactlv known for her kindness. If she's stirring up trouble,your father could get caught in the middle. And Kayla is there by herself. She could be in real danger."

"If my father wants to take Janiya's side, then so be it.It has nothing to do with me." Jeremy stood and strode back to his room.

Janiya rejoining the Graham family had stirred up nothing but discord. Most people hadn't welcomed her,and the tension between Jeremy and Johnny had only deepened.

As Jeremy reached his doorway, Edwin piped up with another question. "By the way, Zoe called today. She invited you to dinner tomorrow night. Should I accept on your behalf?"

Jeremy halted for a moment, his hand resting on the doorknob. His mind had been so tangled with thoughts of Kayla lately that Zoe had nearly slipped from his memory.

He let out a silent breath, wondering if he was starting to lose control. Zoe was the woman he was supposed to care about, after all.

His expression eased a fraction as he nodded. "I'll go to the dinner. Prepare a few decent gifts for me to take."

Edwin dipped his head in acknowledgment. "Got it,Mr.Graham."

Meanwhile,Kayla approached Johnny, who fixed her with a gentle, almost grandfatherly look. "Liam made a mistake, and it's only right he faces the consequences. Still,I've heard about everything going on between you two. Now that you're finally together,don't throw around the word 'divorce' so lightly."

The moment his words landed, Kayla immediately saw.through Janiya's ploy-she'd called Johnny here just to stop the divorce.

Across the room, Janiya and Liam both put on their most innocent faces, as if she was the villain for not letting things go.

Kayla steadied herself with a quiet breath, then met Johnny's gaze head-on. "Whatever happened between Liam and me can't be patched up. I'm here for a divorce, and I'd appreciate your support in that."

Johnny's expression darkened, clearly not expecting her to stand her ground so unflinchingly.

She lifted her chin, voice unwavering as she gestured toward the master bedroom. "It's bad enough he cheated,but he even dared to bring the other woman into our home. You care about the Graham family's reputation, but why should I stay in a marriage that's already shattered?"

The color drained from Janiya's and Liam's faces;neither dared to offer asingle excuse. At that tense moment, the sound of footsteps broke the silence as a doctor, guided by a servant,hurried in to tend to Tricia. Johnny, drawing on years of authority, straightened his posture and spoke in a voice edged with sincerity."Kayla, now that you're married, you're part of the Graham family. I'll make sure Liam makes it up to you for all he's put you through. Let's stop talking about divorce."

Kayla didn't budge as she protested, "Absolutely not."

With a dismissive flick of his hand, Johnny brushed aside her refusal and pivoted to a new topic. "That's not what brought me here tonight."

Liam's eyes lit up. "Grandpa, whatever you need, just say the word."

But Johnny wasn't looking at his grandson. His attention fixed on Kayla, sharp and searching. "I heard Jeremy's seeing your sister. What's the story there?"

Kayla's heart gave a startled jolt. She hadn't expected Johnny to bring up Jeremy.

For a moment, she faltered. "How would I know? I've moved out of my father's place a long time ago.Zoe and I aren't close."

Johnny pressed on, refusing to lether dodge."Maybe you're not close, but you're still family.You must know something."
Liam chimed in, "Kayla, just be honest.Uncle Jeremy's over thirty and still single. Grandpa's worried abouthim."
###Chapter 52 Get Out Of This House
Liam's remark barely fazed Kayla. She scoffed inwardly, wondering why he was so invested in Jeremy's marital status when even Jeremy himself didn't seem to care.

She shrugged, her tone casual and breezy. "I'm not the right person to ask. Maybe someone else knows more than I do."

Janiya stepped into the spotlight, wearing a calculated smile. "Actually, I've already done some digging. Zoe's well-liked among our friends. She's gentle, bright, and cultured-even if her family background isn't the most impressive. Still, she seems to get along with Jeremy just fine."

Johnny's eyes lit up with approval. The thought that Jeremy might finally be settling down pleased him immensely-every eligible heiress he'd introduced to his son had been rejected. Now, with Zoe in the picture, he finally saw hope for the Graham family's future.

Sensing an opportunity, Janiya turned to Johnny."Since you're so curious, why not take advantage of the moment? Kayla's related to Jeremy's girlfriend-she can help us all get acquainted. How about a dinner tomorrow night so everyone can meet?" Kayla's gaze sharpened, instantly wary. Of course,Janiya wouldn't hesitate to use her as a pawn.

Johnny nodded in agreement. "Kayla, I'll leave the arrangements to you and Liam. Make sure to introduce me to Jeremy's girlfriend tomorrow evening. With my milestone birthday coming up, it would be wonderful to celebrate with Jeremy and his partner by my side.Maybe I'll finally have a grandchild to look forward to."

Kayla stayed silent, Jeremy's stern, handsome face flashing across her mind. Wouldn't he be furious if they made the decision behind his back? Besides, she knew Zoe all too well. Pushing Jeremy into this marriage was practically tossing him into a pit.

As Kayla weighed her options, Liamn beamed and jumped in without hesitation. "Don't worry, Grandpa.Kayla and I will handle everything just as you asked."

Johnny looked satisfied, nodding in approval. "Good.I'm counting on you two. If you pull this off, both of you will have a chance to join Graham Group."

Janiya and Liam exchanged gleeful glances, their smiles nearly splitting their faces.

Truth be told, Johnny hadn't come here for Kayla's sake at all; hitting Liam was just a convenient excuse.His real agenda was pushing forward Jeremy's marriage.

Once he felt everything was set in motion, Johnny departed with an air of satisfaction. Kayla's patience snapped. The divorce had been swept under the rug, and now she'd been forced into orchestrating a dinner she never wanted.

She fixed Janiya and Liam with a sharp,mocking smile."It's like watching the same play on repeat-mother and son scrambling for Johnny's approval, hoping to cash in on his favor. But with Jeremy in the picture,you two are dreaming if you think you'll ever get your hands on anything. Isn't this little charade just pathetic?"

Liam, face twisted with pain, braced himself against the table as he tried to stand tall. "Kayla, what the hell are you saying?"

Janiya tightened her grip on his arm, holding him back."Don't take the bait, Liam. She's just stirring up trouble.Besides, your grandpa made it clear-she's got no choice but to help, unless she wants her life to get a lot harder."

Kayla's eyes glinted coldly, her voice ringing with quiet fury."Let's see how long you can ride Johnny's coattails. I can't wait for the day you both get exactly what you deserve."

Liam's anger surged, but the effort sent another stab of pain down his back, making him gasp.

Janiya steadied him, worry etched across her face."Your grandpa promised he wouldn't be rough, but look at you-you felt every bit of that blow."

Kayla couldn't stand another moment in that house. As soon as Johnny's convoy disappeared down the driveway, she made her escape without a backward glance.

Sometime after midnight, Tricia slowly regained consciousness. The first thing she felt was a sharp sting across her cheek-a slap that jolted her fully awake.

She looked up in confusion and saw Janiya looming over her, cold and commanding, flanked by several maids.

"Ms. Graham, why did you hit me?" Tricia stammered,cradling her burning cheek as tears brimmed in her eyes, on the verge of breaking down.

Janiya's gaze was icy and unyielding. "Tricia, maybe Liam's still fooled by your little games, but don't take me for a fool. You're only here to stir up trouble,trying to drag Kayla back and blow this marriage apart.I don't care what you do with my son, but if you dare mess with my interests, don't expect any mercy."

Panic shot through Tricia. She tumbled off the bed and threw herself at Janiya's feet, clutching desperately at her leg. "Please, Mrs. Graham, I just want to be with Liam. I truly love him. I'll do anything you say-just tell me what you want!"

Janiya pried Tricia's hands away, her expression twisted with disgust. "Don't flatter yourself. I'mn not fond of Kayla, but I have even less patience for a scheming woman like you. Get out of this house and don't show up in front of Liam for now!"
###Chapter 53 Are Jeremy And Zoe Seeing Each Other
When Kayla arrived at the office the next morning,her phone buzzed with a notification-Liam had transferred a hefty sum into her account.

The amount was staggering,twice what she'd spent renovating their house. Kayla stared at the balance,her heart untouched by the windfall. If only money could purchase her freedom.

Before she could set her phone down, Liam called."Can you take the day off? I need you to come with me to visit the Cooper family."

Kayla declined. "You can manage Johnny's dinner invitation to Zoe yourself. I'm not getting involved."

But Liam didn't miss a beat. "Kayla, Grandpa wants us both to handle this. You're not dumping it all on me. lf you refuse, I'll tell Grandpa, and let's see if he decides to pay you a visit in person."

A stern look crossed Kayla's face. He always resorted to threats to bend others to his will. Even retired,Johnny's influence ran deep. Crossing him could mean the end of her career in Trark.

But antagonizing Jeremy wasn't an option either-especially if he hadn't decided to introduce Zoe to the family. And then there was Zoe herself, a fraud whose secret could unravel everything at any moment.

Kayla's mind spun with worries, each one knotting tighter inside her skull.

Liam's voice cut through again, harder this time. "So what's it going to be? Are you coming, or should.Grandpa come knock on your door?"
Kayla snapped,"Stop talking. Wait for my call at noon!"With that, she hung up on him without another word.

Kayla pressed her fingers to her temples, drawing in a steadying breath. With no safe path forward,she decided her only move was to test the waters with Jeremy first.

"Kayla,Mr.Newton wants you in the conference room,"a colleague called out.

Kayla swept her files off the desk and hurried after the summons. "I'm on my way."

She pushed open the meeting room door and immediately spotted Edwin among the crowd, flanked by several representatives from North Investment.

For a split second, she hesitated-she'd forgotten Jeremy was sending his people over for today's meeting. Still, she figured this was her chance to pull Edwin aside later and ask a few discreet questions.

Archie, seated at the head of the table, caught sight of her and gestured her in. "Kayla, come join us. You'll be working on this project team from now on. Get  acquainted with Edwin-he'll be around a lot."

Kayla crossed the room and greeted Edwin with a polite nod.

After some quick introductions and a whirlwind of discussion, Edwin and his colleagues wrapped up their.visit and started heading out.

Once they reached the ground floor, KKayla saw her chance.She walked Edwin and his team to the doors,then asked secretly, "Has Jeremy been especially busy lately?"

Edwin shot her a curious look, amused by her unexpected question. "He's always got his hands full.Why, did you want to speak with him?"

"Not at all." Kayla shook her head, brushing off the suggestion. "By the way, are Jeremy and Zoe seeing each other?"

Edwin gave a short laugh. "That's not the case at all."

Kayla arched a brow. "They are not?"

Edwin rubbed the back of his neck, paused to mull it over, then answered, "Not yet. But tonight, he's having dinner with your sister. He almost never invites women out like this."

Kayla's thoughts flickered back to the last banquet-she'd overheard Zoe extending that invitation, and Jeremy had accepted immediately. Clearly, he didn't mind Zoe's company.An odd tightness twisted in Kayla's chest at the memory.

Catching her thoughtful pause, Edwin queried, "Did you need to see Mr. Graham? If so, you could come with us to North Investment. I'm heading there now."

"No, no. Don't let me keep you. Take care." Kayla quickly waved him off, retreating a step or two. She watched from the curb as the group slipped into their cars and rolled out of sight.

Reaching the CEO's office at North Investment,Edwin nudged the door open and found Jeremy dressed in a fitted black shirt, lining up a shot at the billiards table in the lounge area.

Edwin strolled over as he informed Jeremy, "I'm back,Mr.Graham."

Jeremy shot him a sidelong look before flipping another cue in his direction. "Grab a stick and play."

Edwin gripped the cue,lingering by the pool table as he relayed, "I've spoken with Archie about the project.Didn't expect Kayla to join the team."

Jeremy leaned over for his shot, his expression unreadable. "Archie clearly thinks she's got potential.He wouldn't put her on this project otherwise-he's grooming her for bigger things."

Edwin nodded in agreement. "She's sharp. Handles her work better than most." Just then, the phone vibrated loudly on the nearby table. Edwin grabbed it and handed it over to Jeremy.

The butler's voice sounded from the other end, polite but urgent. "Mr. Graham, your father requests your presence for dinner tonight."

Jeremy set down the cue, strode over to the bar, and poured himself a drink. His voice came out cool and distant. "I already have plans tonight. Tell him I'll visit another day."

A brief silence lingered before the butler replied,almost pleading, "But sir, your father said he misses you. If you don't come, he'll head out to find you himself."

Irritation flashed in Jeremy's eyes. Johnny always resorted to these tactics, pushing him into corners.

"I get it," Jeremy muttered before hanging up.

Edwin asked worriedly, "If you have dinner with your father tonight,what about Zoe?"

Jeremy hesitated for a moment, weighing his options,then picked up his phone and dialed Zoe's number.
###Chapter 54 Get Your Hand Off Me
 Around noon, just as Kayla stepped outside, her eyes Landed on Liam's car idling by the curb.

He got out of the car, reached for her hand like nothing was amiss, and said, "Let's go. I'll drive you."

She jerked her hand away and snapped, "Stay away from me."

With an indifferent shrug, he strolled to the front of the car and pulled open the passenger-side door."Suit yourself. Just get in."

Kayla bypassed him without a word, opened the back door, and slipped inside.

Once the car rolled forward, Liam spoke. "We're going to visit the Cooper family."

She shot back, "If you have something to say,handle it on your own. Why do I have to be involved?"

He caught her reflection in the rearview mirror."Haven't seen your dad in a while. Figured now's a good time."

Kayla scoffed, a flash of contempt flickering in her eyes. So now he was playing the dutiful son-in-law?

When the car stopped in front of the Cooper family's place, the security guard checked the license plate and swung the gate open.

"Everyone out!"

The moment Kayla and Liam walked through the door,Zoe's enraged voice rang out from upstairs.

A glass of water came flying down, smashing against the floor just inches from Kayla's feet.

She glanced upward and saw Amaya and Damon rushing toward the staircase, their expressions tight with worry.

"What's going on?" Liam took a step forward, his face painted with faux concern.

Damon, noticing Liam, quickly adopted a more attentive posture and stumbled down the stairs."Oh,it's nothing. Just an accident with Zoe. What brings the two of you here today?"

Kayla eyed the broken glass at her feet. Was it really an accident, or had it been deliberate?

"It's been a while, so I thought I'd drop by and bring some gifts for you." Liam held up several large bags,each overflowing with expensive items.

Damon's face brightened, his eyes glimmering with interest. He grabbed Liam's arm and led him to the sofa. "Have a seat. Let's relax with some coffee."

Meanwhile,faint shouts from upstairs caught Kayla's attention. Amaya and Zoe were having a heated argument, though she couldn't make out the words.

Turning to Kayla, Damon said, "Kayla, come join us.Why stand there like a statue?"

With a short nod, Kayla made her way over to the。seating area.

Upstairs, Zoe's fury was on full display as she angrily sliced through the fabric of a beautiful dress with a pair of scissors.

Amaya rushed in,yanked the scissors from Zoe's grasp,and snapped, "What do you think you are doing? You spent days getting this dress ready, and now you're tearing it to shreds? All that effort for nothing!"

Zoe's hair hung in wild tangles, her eyes red and swollen. She shouted through her tears, "What's the point in saving it? Jeremy didn't bother coming,So who exactly am I meant to impress?"

"That's ridiculous. He couldn't make it tonight, but that doesn't mean he won't come around later. I don't believe for a second that he plans to ignore you forever. What's got you so worked up?" Amaya said,her voice tight with irritation.

Zoe let out a piercing scream. "I couldn't care less! He made a promise, then bailed with just one phone call.How am I supposed to marry him if this is how he treats me?"

Amaya pulled her daughter into the room and clamped a hand over her mouth. "Lower your voice!Kayla and her husband are right downstairs. If they hear this, it's over."

Zoe's anger only deepened at the mention of Kayla."Why is she even here? Did she come just to gloat?"

"Stop it!" Amaya raised her hand in frustration but faltered, unable to follow through.

Zoe's voice cracked as she cried out, "You're really going to hit me? I'm the one he stood up. I'm the one falling apart, and you want to hit me? Seriously?"

Amaya let out a heavy sigh, lowered her arm, and said,"Whatever brought Kayla and Liam here today doesn't matter right now. What matters is that you get it together and come downstairs. Liam may be useless,but he is still a Graham. Don't let a single word of this nonsense reach his ears."

With that, she turned on her heel and exited the room.

Still seething, Zoe snatched the pillows from her bed and hurled them out the open doorway.

Meanwhile, in the living room below, Liam and Damon were deep in a lively conversation. To anyone watching, they could've passed for a real father-son pair.

Kayla sat off to the side, focused on her phone,skimming through the team's group chat.

Archie had just dropped a round of cash gifts. Kayla joined in and managed to collect a few hundred bucks,a small victory that made her grin, she'd treat herself to something good tomorrow.

"Sorry for the wait. Zoe just came back from a day out with her friends and needed a minute to freshen up," Amaya said with a breezy laugh as she approached. She rested a hand lightly on Kayla's shoulder. "It's been sometime. You've slimmed down!I'll have the staff make something special for you later. You should eat more."

Repulsed by her pretense, Kayla snapped, "Get your hand off mne."

Amaya traded an uneasy glance with Damon,then gave a tight smile and pulled her hand away.

Trying to smooth things over, Damon said, "Kayla, is that any way to speak to your stepmother? Where's your respect?"

"Stepmother?" Kayla scoffed under her breath,barely keeping herself from rolling her eyes.

Liam cleared his throat. "Actually, we came today because of Zoe. My grandfather would like to meet her."
###Chapter 55 Meeting Jeremy At The Graham Villa
"Your grandfather wants to see Zoe!" Amaya blurted out, her face a picture of astonishment. With a surge of excitement, she hurried over to Liam, searching his expression. "Liam, is this for real?"

Liam nodded. "I wouldn't make this up. He sent both me and Kayla to pass along the message. If Zoe is okay with it, someone from the Graham family will swing by tonight to pick her up."

Kayla's brows drew together at that. Wasn't tonight supposed to be Jeremy's private meeting with Zoe?How did it turn into Zoe visiting the Graham family?

Questions bubbled up, but Kayla decided not to ask.This was none of her concern, and she'd rather not get involved.

"Wonderful! Zoe wouldn't miss it for the world!"Amaya's joy practically radiated as she dashed up the stairs, her grin stretching impossibly wide. On the landing,she nearly collided with Zoe, who was coming down.

Zoe had already caught snippets of the conversation from above. Grabbing Amaya's hands, she asked, "Are you serious? Johnny actually wants to meet me?"

Amaya's excitement was contagious. "Of course! This is your big moment! Go get yourself ready-the Graham family is expecting you tonight!"

"I just cut the dress into pieces! I have to buy something new. There's still a little time, right?" Zoe spun and sprinted back to her room, eyes bright with anticipation.

Kayla rose from her seat. "I need to run an errand,so I'll be going. You all can carry on."

Just as she moved to leave, Liam caught her wrist."I've wrapped up my conversation with Damon. Let's leave together."

Kayla tried to gently pull away, a hint of frustration twitching at her lips, but Liam's hold only grew firmer.

"We're heading out," Liam said to Damon, then placed a protective arm around Kayla's waist, steering her toward the door.

Damon stood in the entryway, puzzlement etched across his face until Kayla and Liam were out of sight.

Meanwhile, Amaya practically skipped back into the room, unable to hide her glee. "Darling, we're about to hit the mother lode! If Johnny wants to meet Zoe, it must mean he's impressed. Once Zoe marries Jeremy,we'll be set for life-wealth and status, just like we always dreamed!"

Still unconvinced, Damon's brows knit tighter. "It all seems a little too fast, doesn't it? Maybe something's not right." Irritation flashed in Amaya's eyes. She reached over,giving his arm a sharp pinch. "Will you stop being so negative? Zoe is your daughter! Why can't you show a little faith in her? This time, nothing's going to go wrong!"

"Alright, alright, I get it." Damon put his arm around her as they wandered over to the couch. "Still, don't you think it's odd? Wasn't Kayla supposed to be divorcing Liam? The way they acted today, you'd never know there were any problems."

Amaya tossed her head and scoffed, "Kayla's drama doesn't concern me. Liam is barely a blip on the Graham family radar anyway. His mother wasn't even legitimate, so Kayla's never going to match up to Zoe.If Zoe becomes Jeremy's wife, she'll run the household. There's nothing better than that."

Damon's chest swelled with pride. "You're right.We really do have an extraordinary daughter."

Stepping out of the villa, Kayla quickly made her excuses and slipped away. She hailed a taxi, eager to put distance between herself and Liam, and headed straight back to her office.



That evening, the Graham family's estate buzzed with preparations for a formal family gathering-attendance mandatory for everyone.

Since Kayla and Liam remained married,their presence was expected. Earlier that day, Janiya had messaged,pressing Kayla to arrive ahead of time.

Kayla had other plans. She intentionally lingered,intending to arrive only after the festivities were already underway.

Nevertheless, she picked up a small present and called a cab. Since vehicles weren't allowed past the main gates, she stepped out quietly and walked the rest of the way up the drive.

At that moment, the heavy iron gates of the estate swung open, allowing a parade of glossy black luxury cars to glide onto the property.

Automatically, Kayla moved aside, casting a discreet glance as the convoy swept past. The understated elegance of the vehicles radiated quiet power, and the flawless coordination of the procession-security detail and all-spoke of absolute authority.

Inside the lead car, Jeremy reclined in the back seat,the window halfway down. Streetlights spilled over his angular features, making his expression seem even colder and more distant than usual.

The motorcade whisked by, offering Kayla only the briefest view.

A thought tugged at her. Jeremy hardly ever showed up at these family gatherings. He must have returned tonight because Zoe was expected. But if that was true,why hadn't he picked Zoe up himself? Turning the qulestion over in her mind, Kayla continued up the driveway until she reached the villa. Jeremy,having just exited his car, now stood in a perfectly tailored black suit that made his presence impossible to ignore.

As Kayla lingered at the doorway, an uncomfortable uncertainty grew. Should she greet him or simply slip by without a word?

With a deep breath, she decided to avoid trouble by bowing her head and quickening her steps, trying to make it inside unnoticed.

But Jeremy's steely eyes found her immediately,holding her in place.

Gathering her composure, Kayla forced a polite smile and said, "Good evening."
###Chapter 56 Get Out

Jeremy didn't say a word-he simply strode toward Kayla,each step exuding quiet power.

His custom-tailored suit,paired wvith a crisp white shirt,made him look razor sharp. His chiseled features and striking gaze could unnerve anyone around him.

As soon as their eyes met, Kayla's breath hitched. Her heart began to pound against her ribs.

She didn't understand it; she knew she feared him, yet she couldn't stop looking at him.

Jeremy moved with deliberate, commanding steps,his presence overwhelming.

Fists clenched, Kayla willed herself to take a deep breath,bracing herself for whatever he had to say.

But instead of speaking to her, Jeremy simply walked past her. As his gaze landed on the sleek car parked by the driveway, he stopped in his tracks and asked flatly, "Are we expecting a guest today?"

Kayla turned her head and followed his gaze,noticing Zoe's car.

Back when Zoe had just graduated college, Amaya and Damon had spent a fortune buying her this car. Zoe had flaunted it shamelessly, even when the Cooper family's fortunes had begun to dwindle.No matter how tight things got, Amaya and Damon would bend over backwards to grant Zoe's every wish, whereas Kayla never got a penny.

Jeremy,lips pursed, clearly didn't recognize the car.

"Yes, Mr. Graham!" The butler shuffled forward and。bowed. "I believe you'll be quite pleased to see the guest."

Jeremy,however, gave no sign of interest. Without a word,he turned and strode into the villa, never once glancing back at Kayla.

She let out a long breath she hadn't realized she'd been holding, and the tension in her shoulders eased a little. His presence was always so intimidating-keeping her distance felt like the safest option.

Obviously, Johnny was behind all this, but she couldn't help but wonder how Jeremy would react when he found out that his unexpected visitor was none other than Zoe.

Just then, Liam stepped out from the villa. He spotted her still rooted in place, her expression unreadable."Why are you just standing there? I offered to pick you up, but you turned me down, and now that you're suddenly here, you don't want to go in?"

"Who said I'm not going in?” Kayla shot him a sharp glare, chin tilted defiantly, before striding into the house with renewed confidence.

Liam scampered after her, eager to make it up to her. "Here, let me carry your things," he offered with a sycophantic grin.

Jeremy didn't head straight to the dining room Instead, he veered off to his room, craving a hot shower and fresh change of clothes.

But the moment he pushed open the door, he felt his skin prickle-something felt off.

"Has anyone been in my room today?" he asked,glancing back at the servant who had just entered to prepare his bath.

The servant hesitated for a second. "Ms. Cooper was feeling unwell, sir. Your father said she could rest here for a bit."

Jeremy's brows arched. "Ms. Cooper?" He had just seen Kayla outside. How on earth could she have ended up in his bed?

Confused, he marched over and yanked the blanket back.

Zoe stirred beneath the blanket, her silhouette outlined by a slinky dress that clung to her curves in all the places meant to catch attention. With a drowsy yawn,she reached her arms out and stretched-slowly and deliberately-before opening her eyes and feigning surprise.

"Zoe?" Jeremy's voice dropped several hundred degrees, his grip on the blanket tightening. "Jeremy, you're back!" Zoe's face lit up like fireworks.Her makeup was flawless, carefully curated to make her look innocent yet alluring. She sat up in bed with a practiced grace, deliberately assuminng a seductive posture.

Only as Jeremy tossed the blanket aside did he notice his surroundings. Zoe's jacket was tossed on the nightstand, her purse half open, high heels abandoned on the floor. Lipstick smeared a pillow, and foundation stained the blanket.

His jaw tightened. He was a man who lived for order,and he required that everything stay in its place. Now,however,his private sanctuary had been invaded by an intruder.

"Surprise, Jeremy. I brought you something. Your father mentioned you loved roasted chestnuts as a child, so I bought them for you. Want some?" Zoe flashed him her pearly whites, completely oblivious to the rising tension in the room. She gave a little smile and gestured toward the table.

She leaned forward ever so slightly, her strapless dress slipping just enough to showcase her generous cleavage. Every move was calculated to tantalize, so much so that even the servant had to turn away,blushing awkwardly.

Jeremy suppressed his irritation and grabbed her wrist,pulling her off the bed. "Get out," he ordered, his voice as cold as steel. Zoe blinked,her wide, mascara-framed eyes fluttering in confusion. "What's wrong? You don't want me here?"

"Get out," he repeated, hissing through gritted teeth.

Sensing the crackling tension, the servant quickly stepped in to mediate. "Ms. Cooper, perhaps it's best if you give Mr. Graham a moment of privacy. After all,he still needs to shower and change.".

Even someone as thick-skinned as Zoe could téll that she was not welcome here. Lips pursed, she gave a reluctant nod. "Alright, alright, I'm going."

She headed for the door, but every few steps, she would look back over her shoulder in the hopes that Jeremy would change his mind.However, the latter remained icily silent.

As soon as the door clicked shut behind her, Jeremy's expression darkened even further. He irritably tugged his tie loose, flung it onto the sofa, and strode to the floor-to-ceiling window. "What is she doing here?" he spat in disgust.

The servant paused and chose her words carefully."Your father said he wished to meet the woman he believed to be your girlfriend, so he arranged for Ms.Cooper's visit. Liam and his wife helped coordinate."

Jeremy let out a slow breath. So this was why Johnny had orchestrated his return for tonight's family dinner.

"So everyone decided to play a trick on me, huh?"
###Chapter 57 So That's How It Is
A sudden sneeze escaped Kayla as she sat at the dining tabole, prompting her to quickly dab her nose with a tissue.

A nagging suspicion crossed her mind-was someone gossiping about her?

Ever the picture of the dutiful husband, Liamn leaned over, fussing and loading her plate with more food."Kayla, you've gotten too thin lately. You should eat a little extra."

Instead of thanking him, Kayla simply pushed the food to the edge of her plate, barely acknowledging it.

Seated at the head of the table, Johnny surveyed the room,his eyes reflecting quiet pride at the seemingly harmonious family meal.

Only Zoe looked distinctly uncomfortable. With this being her first visit, she felt out of place. Other than Kayla, she didn't know a soul. The Graham family's appraising glances made it clear they saw her as someone angling for a step up the social ladder. She found herself wishing desperately for Jeremy's arrival.

Yet, as dinner went on, Jeremy remained conspicuously absent. Eventually, Johnny broke the silence, turning to the butler. "Go see what's keeping Jeremy. Why hasn't he joined us for dinner yet?"

Zoe's anxiety grew. The idea of being scolded for overstepping boundaries in Jeremy's home left her too nervous to eat.

Catching Zoe's discomfort, Janiya offered an encouraging smile. "It's only natural to feel a little awkward your first time here, Zoe. You'll get used to us. Why not have Kayla show you around thevilla later? You two can catch up."

Kayla shot Janiya a cold glance. Everyone at the table was well aware she didn't get along with Zoe, but Janiya still pushed her to play hostess. The move felt deliberately provocative.

Seizing the chance to smooth things over, Zoe offered Kayla a soft smile. "Sorry to trouble you, Kayla."

Janiya quickly interjected, "Trouble? Nonsense! After you marry Jeremy, we'll be family."

The word "family" made Kayla want to puke. Zoe marrying Jeremy? The idea left her reeling.

Flushed and self-conscious, Zoe dropped her gaze to her plate, cheeks tinged red.

A warm laugh rumnbled from Johnny. "That's right! It's rare for Jeremy to be so taken with someone. The sooner you two make it official, the better. I can't wait to dote on a grandchild."

A brilliant blush swept across Zoe's cheeks, but a sense of triumph blossomed in herchest. Surely, this meant her spot as Jeremny's future wife was secure.

"Did you really think I wouldn't notice you all plotting.behind my back?" Suddenly, a low and frigid voice shattered the easy conversation. The entire room froze,silence dropping like a heavy curtain.

A chill rippled down Kayla's spine. She turned to the source-a tall figure in a crisp shirt and dark slacks,commanding attention from the moment he entered.His presence was magnetic, the sharp angles of his face so arresting that "devastatingly attractive" barely did him justice.

"Jeremy, you're finally here! Zoe has been waiting for you." Janiya gave brisk instructions for the servants to bring food, assuming her role as hostess with practiced ease.

At the table's head sat Jeremy's designated seat, with Zoe positioned beside it-a clear mark of family approval, courtesy of Johnny.

Nervous but hopeful, Zoe glanced up at him, her eyes luminous with feeling. "Jeremy," she whispered softly.

"Dad, you seem intent on arranging my marriage without my consent. Haven't I made myself clear enough?" Jeremy's gaze never flickered Zoe's way.His words cut through the room like ice as he took his seat, the air around him thick with warning. On the other side, Kayla crossed her arms, rubbing at her skin, trying to dispel the sudden cold.

Johnny, picking up on the tension, tried to laugh it off."If your sister hadn't brought it up, I wouldn't even know you were seeing someone! I just wanted a family dinner with Zoe, to get acquainted. Or were you planning to keep her a secret forever?"

Jeremy's eyes flashed coldly toward Janiya and Liam."Perennia Group's mess has barely settled, and yet you all find time to meddle in my private life now?"

A flicker of uncertainty crossed Janiya's face before she hastily tried to clarify. "That's not how it happened at all. Kayla mentioned her sister was seeing you, so l thought this would be a perfect time to introduce her to the family. Jeremy, you're not exactly a kid anymore.Dad would really rest easier if you finally settled down."

Liam nodded. "That's right, Uncle Jeremy. We just want to see you happy with someone by your side."

Hearing her name dropped into the middle of the conversation, Kayla tensed, caught off guard. The weight of Jeremy's stare pressed down on her,making it impossible to ignore. How could Janiya drag her into the mess?

"So that's how it is, Kayla?" Jeremy's gaze swung to her,his voice icy and sharp, and Kayla felt the chill of his words ripple straight through her.
###Chapter 58 Just You Wait

A moment of hesitation caught Kayla, her grip tightening unconsciously around the fork.

Neither Janiya nor Liam spoke up in her defense,choosing to stay silent.

Drawing in a steadying breath,Kayla replied with calm resolve, "I've already made myself clear-who Jeremy chooses to date is entirely his concern. Yet Janiya had to drag me into it. Janiya, if you're really worried about his love life, why not ask him? There's no reason to put the blame on me."

Janiya's expression changed at that, and she quickly turned to Jeremy in an attempt to smooth things over."Jeremy, it's not like that..."

"That's enough," Jeremy interjected sharply. "My personal life isn't up for discussion. Going forward, I don't want anyone interfering."

Barely controlled irritation laced Jeremy's voice. A heavy tension settled over the table, each person caught up in their own thoughts, yet no one daring to break the silence.

Johnny cleared his throat and turned to Jeremy "Jeremy, I think Zoe is a fine young woman. What are your intentions toward her?" "I'll take responsibility for what happened between Zoe and me, but this isn't something you get a say in."With that, Jeremy rose from his seat without touching his food, leaving the room behind.

The lack of even basic courtesy toward Johnny underscored the deep rift between father and son.

Still, his words set off a wave of understanding around the table. It was obvious to everyone-Jeremy and Zoe's relationship had already crossed a line, and a wedding was surely in their future.

Zoe, tense just moments before, now radiated joy after hearing Jeremy's declaration.

As dinner ended, Janiya insisted Kayla give Zoe a tour of the property. Eager for any excuse to leave the stifling dining room, Kayla quickly agreed.

Out in the garden, life pulsed in every corner. Fresh green leaves fluttered in the gentle wind, and the air was sweet with the scent of new growth.

Although it was her first time setting foot in this garden, Kayla found nothing of interest. Upon reaching the pavilion, she refused to continue and claimed a spot on a stone bench.

Meanwhile,Zoe remained lively, her mood lifted even higher by the envious glances they'd received from the staff along the path.

Pausing in her tracks, Zoe threw an impatient look over her shoulder. "Why are you just sitting there?I'm not finished looking around."

Kayla leaned back on the bench, crossed her legs,and popped a snack in her mouth. "You've got feet,haven't you? Go on and wander by yourself."

A sour look flashed across Zoe's face. She marched over, towering above Kayla with a clear sense of self -importance. "Your mother-in-law told you to show me around. If you slack off, I won't hesitate to let her know."

Unbothered, Kayla merely shrugged with a look of total indifference. "Be my guest. I'm already on the outs with her and her son, so tattle all you like. Makes no difference to me."

Zoe faltered, caught off guard by Kayla's apathy. Her mind scrambled for a new angle until she recalled the look of bitterness on Kayla's face during dinner, as if the world owed her something.

A sly smirk tugged at Zoe's lips as she settled down across from Kayla, her words thick with arrogance "You must be jealous, Kayla."

Kayla arched an eyebrow. "Jealous of what, exactly?"

Was she supposed to be jealous of Zoe's obliviousness-so blind she let Janiya use her like a pawn?

"Johnny made my position official tonight. I'm going to marry Jeremy-nothing can stop me now." Zoe beamed, as if she was already Jeremy's wife.

"Oh. Sounds like you finally got what you wanted."

Zoe,emboldened by Kayla's lack of enthusiasm, let her tongue run wild. "No matter what you do, you'll never come close to my level. You grew up.motherless-girls like you don't even deserve a comparison."

The mention of her mother turned Kayla's expression to frost. Without a word, she scooped up a handful of snacks and hurled them straight at Zoe's face.

Zoe let out a startled shriek, leaping to her feet as snacks grazed her cheek. "Are you crazy? What's wrong with you?"

"Say one more word about my mother, and next time,it won't be something so harmless." Kayla brushed the crumbs from her hands, shot Zoe a look of pure disdain, and strode off without a backward glance.

"Just you wait, Kayla! When I marry Jeremy, you'll be the one begging for mercy!" Fuming, Zoe raisedher voice after her. Her fists clenched at her sides,trembling with frustration and helpless anger.

With Zoe left behind, Kayla relished her brief freedom.She strolled through the estate's winding paths,searching for the quickest escape from this suffocating display of family pride.

All she wanted was to be back in her own peaceful home,far from this toxic atmosphere. Drawn by the sound of soft piano notes, she paused near one of the villa's side buildings.

The gentle melody tugged at her curiosity.She crept to a back window, lifted the curtain just enough, and peeked inside.

Bathed in warm light, Jeremy sat alone at the piano,his posture relaxed as his fingers glided effortlessly over the keys,filling the room with music.
###Chapter 59 Were You The One Playing The Piano Ju...
Kayla rested her shoulder against the windowpane,letting the flowing piano melody wash over her. The tempo wavered-alternating between gentle and spirited-as Jeremy's slender fingers moved with practiced ease across the keys.

She had never witnessed Jeremy at the piano before.Soft lighting spilled over him, cloaking his figure in a golden hue.

The tune stirred something in her, as if drawn from a distant,familiar place.

The butler stepped in quietly and leaned close to speak.Jeremy gave a brief nod,rose from the bench,and walked out.

Seeing her chance, Kayla crept through the doorway.Her eyes landed on the sheet music resting on the stand, an embellished arrangement of a Tchaikovsky composition.

No wonder it struck a chord. Her mother had been fond of Tchaikovsky and used to guide her through his pieces when she was young.

"This doesn't look too hard," Kayla whispered,her hands itching to try. With the room now empty,she eased onto the bench. Just Now Jeremy hadn't gotten far when a stream of notes drifted after him, catching his attention.

He paused, glancing over his shoulder with a thoughtful expression.

The butler, clearly confused, asked, "Mr. Graham, is®everything all right?"

Jeremy looked away from the door and went to handle other matters.

Kayla wrapped up the piece soon, her chest full of admiration. Whoever reworked the composition had true skill. As she basked in the final chord, the sound of footsteps neared.

Alarmed, she sprang to her feet and ducked behind the bookshelf.

She had just caught her breath when the door eased open with a creak.

Zoe poked her head through the doorway, her eyes scanning every corner. Spotting no one, she strode in with unwarranted confidence.

Her eyes darted across the room before settling on the piano stand. She snatched up the sheet music,skimmed it with disinterest, and let it fall onto the table with a scoff. "Just a mess of scribbles. What kind of rubobish is this?"

She meandered aimlessly, prodding at trinkets and furnishinas along the way. Unimpressed, she sank onto  Now the piano bench and jabbed at the keys, muttering,"That bitch left me alone, and Jeremy's vanished.Where the hell did they both run off to? I could have used this time to charm him; now it's blown."

Hiding behind the bookshelf, Kayla watched Zoe clearly.

Zoe kept shuffling through the pages carelessly,bumping a nearby glass in the process. Water poured onto the sheet music, soaking the pages beyond repair.

From the hallway, footsteps approached again. The butler's voice filtered through the partially closed door. "Mr. Graham, forgive the disturbance, but your father insisted the banquet wouldn't conclude without your presence."

Jeremy's response came coldly. "Tell him to stay out of my business. This is the last warning he'll get."

The door creaked open just as Zoe panicked,stuffing the soggy sheet music into the trash.

She straightened quickly, fumbling to compose herself as Jeremy entered the room.

His eyes narrowed slightly. "Why are you here?"

Zoe shifted slightly, angling her body to obscure the trash can behind her. Her voice took on a delicate sweetness. "I was just strolling around after dinner and somehow ended up here." Jeremy's attention shifted to the piano stand, the earlier melody still lingering in his mind. A trace of curiosity crossed his face as he asked, "Were you the one playing the piano just now?"

Zoe hesitated fora beat,then nodded with confidence."Yeah,that was me."

Behind the bookshelf, Kayla rolled her eyes. Zoe's audacity never ceased to amaze her. Just look how she spun lies as effortlessly as breathing!

Jeremy asked, intrigued, "You're familiar with that composition?"

Zoe gave another confident nod. "Absolutely."

The butler asked, "Ms. Cooper, that piece isn't easily mastered. Are you certain you've played it before?"

Zoe bit her lower lip, looking a little uncertain now.She avoided offering a clear answer.

Jeremy stepped in closer, his eyes moving to the trash can she tried so hard to hide. Inside, the ruined sheet music rested.

His tone turned cold. "Did you put that there?"

Zoe quickly shook her head,hands raised as if to push the blame elsewhere. "I had nothing to do with that!That's how it looked when I got here. Please don't misunderstand." Jeremy suggested, "If you're telling the truth, why not Just Now play a bit of it for me now?"

Though her face remained composed, a wave of panic churned in Zoe's chest. "I'm a little tired tonight.Maybe another time?"

She was obviously dodging the question, and she blinked with unease.

Jeremy,sharp as ever, saw straight through her. He motioned toward the doorway. "It's time for you to go.I'll have someone see you out."

Zoe lingered,clearly unwilling to leave, but the butler stepped in with a firmer tone. "Ms. Cooper, please return for now. Mr. Graham requires some quiet."

"Fine, another day then," Zoe muttered, finally allowing herself to be led out.

The door shut behind her, and stillness settled over the room once more.

From her hiding place, Kayla watched as Jeremy reached into the trash and gently pulled out the soggy sheet music. He dabbed at it with a tissue, treating each page with a care that spoke volumes.

What made this arrangement so meaningful to him?

Jeremy turned suddenly and made his way toward the bookshelf.

Kayla gasped slightly, and she pressed herself deeper into the corner, her fingers clutching the edge of her If he realized she had been at the piano, would he be upset with her?
###Chapter 60 The Smell Is Unbearable
A hush filled the room,each of Jeremy's footsteps.slicing through the silence with unmistakable clarity.

Pressed flat against the bookshelf, Kayla could barely breathe. Her heart hammered wildly, every thump threatening to give away her hiding spot as his shadow drew closer with every measured step.

Jeremy took his time, eyes methodically sweeping over every inch of the space before settling on the bookshelf's edge.

Abruptly,he paused, flicking droplets from the sheet music he held. "Are you going to step out on your own,or should I come pull you out myself?"

Kayla held her breath, paralyzed-neither brave enough to answer nor bold enough to reveal herself.

Tonight,Jeremy seemed in no hurry, his patience tinged with something almost predatory. He lingered,letting the silence grow heavy, then spoke again. "You were bold enough to sneak into my room and play my piano,but now you can't even reveal yourself?"

After a few ragged breaths, Kayla mustered her courage. She squeezed her eyes shut for a heartbeat,then emerged from her hiding place, moving with the awkward stiffness of someone desperately trying not to be noticed.

At that moment, Edwin's voice shattered the tension."Mr. Graham, urgent news!"

Without a second thought, Kayla darted right back behind the bookshelf,vanishing once more.

Jeremy,catching the glimpse of her retreat, couldn't hide the flash of irritation in his eyes.

"Mr. Graham?" Edwin's persistent knocking rattled the door, refusing to be ignored.

Reluctantly, Jeremy turned and exited the room.

Seeing her chance, Kayla wasted no time. She slipped the window open and slipped outside, careful not to make a sound.

Meanwhile, Edwin relayed his message at the door."Your father insists you escort Zoe home tonight. If you refuse, he'll have her stay here as your guest."

There was no universe in which Jeremy would allow Zoe to spend the night at the villa.

"Hold on." Stepping back inside, Jeremy noticed the vacant spot behind the bookshelf. The open window left no doubt-his mysterious pianist had already slipped away.

His gaze caught a glint beneath the sill. Bending down,he retrieved a ring-an exact match for his own.

A shadow flickered across his face as he quietly tucked the ring into his pocket.

Meanwhile, Kayla raced toward the main hall, nerves jangling with every hurried step. The last thing she wanted was to be intercepted by Jeremy's staff. In her rush, she nearly crashed into Janiya, who had just appeared in her path.

Annoyance flashed in Janiya's eyes as she recoiled and pressed a hand to her chest. "What's the hurry? You can't just run wild here!"

Not a word of protest crossed Kayla's lips. She kept her expression neutral and let the criticism slide.

Drawn by the noise, Liam joined them, worry etched into his brow. "What's going on, Mom?"

A sharp finger jabbed in Kayla's direction as Janiya launched her complaint. "Your wife nearly bowled me over. Can't she watch where she's going?"

Liam shot Kayla a quick glance, then attempted to smooth things over. "Mom, I'm sure Kayla didn't mean it. You're always so understanding. There's no reason to take it to heart."

"A daughter-in-law like her is an embarrassment to us all!" Janiya flicked her sleeve in disgust before pulling Liam aside for a private word. "Listen closely, both of you-tonight, you and Jeremy are personally responsible for getting Zoe home safely. That's an order from my father."

Privately, Kayla nearly laughed at their obsessive coddling of Zoe. Even Jeremy didn't show half as much concern.

"Don't worry, Mom," Liam replied dutifully. "I'll make sure both Uncle Jeremy and Zoe return without a hitch."

Without another word, Liam took Kayla by the hand.and guided her out the door.

Only at the entrance did she finally manage to free herself from his grip.

Already, Jeremy's motorcade was perfectly lined up,each car gleaming in the night. Zoe swept out of the villa surrounded by a flock of servants, her eyes narrowed in a smug, challenging look aimed straight at Kayla.

A wave of annoyance washed over Kayla.

Leaning in close, Liam whispered, "Let's go. We'll take the car behind Uncle Jeremy's."

They had barely set foot toward the back when Edwin intercepted them. "MMr. Graham wants you both to join him in his car."

Both Liam and Kayla exchanged startled looks at the unexpected invitation.

Soon enough,the convoy rolled away from the estate.

Inside the roomy,well-appointed car, the four rode together. Refreshments and snacks were neatly arranged,giving the whole ride an oddly luxurious air. Jeremy sat apart, eyes closed, an unmistakable chill emanating from him as he toyed absently with a ring.No one dared break the heavy silence.

Stiffness crept into Kayla's back from sitting so rigidly.She shifted her legs, only to accidentally tap Jeremy's shoe with her foot.

In an instant, she drew her foot away and shot a nervous glance at him. He didn't move-a statue, eyes still closed, betraying no reaction.

Relief washed over Kayla, and she quietly exhaled,grateful she hadn't disturbed him.

Their progress soon ground to a halt-a traffic accident had brought all cars to a standstill, trapping the convoy on the crowded road.

A wave of nausea rolled through Kayla's stomach,forcing her to crack the window for a breath of fresh air.

Almost immediately, Zoe wrinkled her nose in exaggerated disgust. "Ugh, the air outside is disgusting.Kayla,would you mind shutting the window?"
A look of irritation flickered across Kayla's face as she shot Zoe a glare. "I need the air, so I'm leaving it open."

Confidence from Johnny's open favoritism gave Zoe an extra push. "But the rest of us are suffering.The smell is unbearable!"

Annovance sharpened Kayla's voice. "If you ask me you're making it up. I don't notice any bad smell at all.Besides,Jeremy hasn't complained. Maybe your sense of smell is just overly sensitive."

Zoe's expression soured, clearly stunned that Kayla would dare contradict her so bluntly. With a practiced sweetness, she turned to Jeremy and tried again."Jeremy, don't you agree the window should be closed?"
###Chapter 61 A Fetish About Cleanliness
 Curiosity flickered in Kayla's eyes as she glanced Jeremy's way, eager to see how he'd react.

Unmoved by Zoe's hopeful look, Jeremy gave no indication of interest-not even a glance in her direction, his eyes staying resolutely closed.

Awkwardness swept over Zoe as she scrambled for an explanation. "Never mind. I guess we've passed the worst of it. The air's not that bad now."

A quiet snort of laughter escaped Kayla before she clamped a hand over her mouth, trying to hide her amusement.

Seizing the moment, Liam chimed in, "If it's fine now,some fresh air wouldn't hurt at all."

No one rushed to support Zoe, leaving her red-faced and fuming, her annoyance simmering just beneath the surface.

A tiny smile tugged at Kayla's lips. Yet as she turned her head, her heart skipped-Jeremy was suddenly staring straight at her, his eyes cool and sharp.

Instantly, she wiped the grin from her face, turning back to the window with forced nonchalance. Breaking the tension, Jeremy addressed the driver."There's no telling when traffic will clear up. Pull over for now."

No sooner had the car stopped than Zoe, still stewing,spotted a convenience store nearby. "I want to grab a snack. Jeremy, will you wait here for me?"

Jeremy said nothing, but his silence gave her all the permission she needed.

Without another word, Zoe slipped out of the car,then paused to shoot Kayla an insistent look. "Kayla,why don't you join me? Sitting here will just bore you to death."

She just didn't want to leave Kayla alone with Jeremy.Kayla's looks had always unsettled her.

Kayla was eager for a little fresh air. The longer she stayed beside Jeremy, the more likely she was to slip up.

A moment later, the vehicle held only Jeremy and Liam.The silence felt heavy, and Liam, sensing the tension,quickly excused himself to make a phone call,stepping outside for a cigarette and leaving Jeremy to his thoughts.

Without watching her step, Zoe barreled toward the convenience store, only to take a spectacular tumble. Trailing a few steps behind, Kayla stopped short. A moment later, she couldn't help but burst out laughing."Eager to kiss the pavement? Don't fall on your fake breasts."

A furious glare was all Zoe gave Kayla as she scrambled to her feet, wincing. The fall had left her aching, and her once-elegant dress was now streaked with grime.

Nearly stumbling again as she stood, Zoe reached out and steadied herself against a trash can. Glancing back,she found Kayla still giggling-a sight that only made her cheeks burn hotter. "What, are you blind? You couldn't lift a finger to help?"

Kayla simply clicked her tongue, her expression calm and unmoved. "You landed on your own. Why would I step in?"

Anger flashed in Zoe's eyes. She clenched her fists,but catching sight of Jeremy's bodyguards watching nearby,she swallowed her retort and stormed into the store.

Once inside, Kayla grabbed a bottle of water, while Zoe snatched up a stack of tissues and scrubbed furiously at her soiled dress. At the counter, Zoe tossed in a pack of gum.

"Take some. Maybe it'll keep your filthy mouth busy for once." Zoe shoved the pack at Kayla, popped a piece into her own mouth, and turned away, cheeks flushed with embarrassment and anger.

Kayla could only stare, caught off guard by such childish pettiness. The dress now looked so ruined, it was almost comical. Zoe hurried back toward the motorcade,only to be met by Edwin's polite but firm blockade. "Mr.Graham is particular about cleanliness. I'm afraid your dress might dirty the seats."

A flush crept over Zoe's face as she glanced down at the muddy fabric. "I tripped earlier. I'll change as soon as we get home. Please, can't I just sit in the car?"

Edwin merely gestured toward a different vehicle."If you don't mind, the second car will be more suitable.Mr.Graham has a fetish about cleanliness."

Left with no choice, Zoe shuffled off to the car behind.

Meanwhile, Kayla's phone buzzed with a work call. She stepped aside to take it, finished her conversation, and returned to the car without thinking twice. The instant she settled in, the car pulled away from the curb.

It was only then that she realized she shared the vehicle wth just the driver-and Jeremy.

Where are Liam and Zoe?

Confused, Kayla glanced out the window and noticed the convoy of cars trailing behind them. It dawned on her that Zoe and Liam must be in the second vehicle.

As she was lost in thought, Jeremy suddenly asked,"Where is your ring-the one Zane gave you?"
###Chapter 62 It Hurts

Kayla searched her pockets with quick taps, only to come up empty. The ring was missing

A sharp jolt surged through her chest.

Jeremy, noting her sudden quiet, slipped a ring from his pocket and began to spin it between his fingers with practiced ease.

A faint smile tugged at his mouth as he said evenly,"Other than me, only Zane owns the same ring.But he already gave his to you."

Kayla raised her chin, composing herself in an instant.She cleared her throat and replied, "I'm not sure how it got into your hands, but thanks for finding it."

She leaned forward to take the ring, but Jeremy shifted at the last second, and her hand slipped past -sending her tumbling into his chest.

His arms wrapped around her in a firm catch, and the sudden press of her figure against his sparked a rush of heat through him.

Kayla's faint perfume filled Jeremy's senses, stirring a restless desire that felt eerily familiar to that night of passion.

As Jeremy lingered in the sensation, Kayla let out a small cry of surprise. Her head bumped his chest, and her movements against him only stoked the fire already rising in his blood.

Jeremy, visibly uneasy, pressed a hand to the top of Kayla's head and muttered through clenched teeth,"What do you think you are doing?"

With her face buried against him, Kayla's reply came soft and muffled. "My hair's stuck on your shirt button.I can't get it loose."

Still pinned to his chest, Kayla turned bright red,mortified. The steady rhythm of his heartbeat thudded against her ear, only deepening her blush.

Jeremy inhaled sharply. Every slight movement from her made his restraint waver. He gave her back a light pat. "Hold still. I'll take care of it."

At his instruction, Kayla froze, not daring to move a muscle.

Jeremy ducked to search under the seat for something useful, but came up empty-handed.Resigned, he began working through the tangle with his fingers. Kayla winced and let out a cry.

"Jeremy,please be careful-it really hurts!"

He paused and pulled his hand back, his tone flat."|t′S knotted tight. I can't free it."

Tears welled in Kayla's eyes as frustration took hold."What do you expect me to do now? I can't stay stuck to you like this!" Jeremy leaned forward and instructed the driver to stop at the next available spot.

Behind them, the convoy of cars took another route,veering off instead of following.

From one of the other vehicles, Zoe watched Jeremy's car disappear down the road. Panic surged as she slammed a hand against the window. "What's happening? Where's Jeremy going?"

The driver glanced at Zoe through the rearview mirror."Mr. Graham instructed me to drop you off at home.This way's faster."

Zoe clenched her jaw, unable to protest. It was Jeremy's directive, after all. Regardless, she struck the seat in frustration, her expression twisted with irritation.

Beside her, Liam sat rigid, his tone low and sharp. "Did Uncle Jeremy take Kayla with him?"

He was seething. A quick step outside to answer a call had landed him in the same vehicle as Zoe-of all people.

Zoe scoffed loudly. "Jeremy probably finds Kayla disgusting. She reeks-her breath's unbearable!"

Liam, already annoyed, turned on her. "You're the one with bad breath!"

"Excuse me? Kayla's the one who smells. How dare you insult me like that? What kind of man are you?"Coddled by Johnny's constant praise, Zoe had grown  smug and didn't give a damn about Liam.

This time, he snapped. Grabbing a box from the seat,he hurled it at her face. "Keep running your mouth and see what happens."

He shoved the door open and jumped out without another word.

Zoe, frozen in shock, clutched her cheek before screaming after him, "You and Kayla are both trash!"

Meanwhile, back in Jeremy's car, Kayla's hair remained caught on his shirt, the two still tangled in an uncomfortable closeness.

Kayla,her cheek nearly pressed into the seat cushion,gave Jeremy's tie a gentle tug and mumbled, "Are we there yet?"

Jeremy turned to the window, eyes on the road ahead."Take us to that hotel," he instructed the driver."Check in under Dewitt's name. Make it quick."

The luxury hotel they were nearing belonged to Dewitt-one of his more lavish ventures.

Kayla jerked upright in surprise, only to wince as her hair caught again, yanking at her scalp.

"Why are we going to a hotel? What's going on?"
###Chapter 63 What Do You Think I'm About To Do
Jeremy knew Kayla had gotten the wrong idea, but he didn't feel like clearing things up. Instead,his hand slid to cradle her head, his tone even but warning. "Don't move unless you want to end up hurt. That'll be on you."

Irritation welled up inside Kayla, but she swallowed her response, choosing silence over argumnent.

Upon arrival at the hotel, Jeremy took charge at the reception, handling the check-in with practiced efficiency before guiding her toward the elevators.

Pressed close to his side, Kayla kept her head tucked against his chest, earning them a barrage of curious glances. Behind the counter, two clerks traded knowing looks and hushed giggles as the pair stepped into the elevator together.

The room key flashed, the lock clicked open, and Jeremy ushered Kayla inside.

While steering her toward the bed, Jeremy's foot caught on the edge of the rug, sending both of them tumbling onto the mattress in a heap.

A startled gasp escaped Kayla as she scrambled to disentangle herself, but her lips brushed the side of Jeremy's neck by accident. The moment snapped To Do tight with tension.

Hands pressed to the mattress, Jeremy braced himself,knuckles white. A slow flush crept from his collar upward, his whole body humming with an unspoken charge.

"Jeremy!" Kayla's voice rang out, panic lacing her tone as she shoved against his chest.

With a rough exhale, Jeremy dipped his head, his whisper rough and close to her ear. "What do you think I'm about to do?"

Panic thundered in her chest. Alone in a hotel room with Jeremy? Nothing good could come of this.

"I..." Words failed her as her hands clutched desperately at the sheets.

Instead of advancing, Jeremy swept her up and set her down beside a nearby cabinet. He reached in and retrieved a pair of scissors.

The glint of metal made Kayla's heart skip, her muscles tightening in alarm. But with a deft motion,Jeremy snipped the stubborn knot from her hair,severing the strands and their forced proximity all at once.

Only a small lock of her hair had been trimmed,but the space between them widened, tension broken by the quick, clean cut. Seeing the snipped strands in her hand left Kayla quietly dismayed, but her gaze snapped upward the moment she caught sight of the lipstick smear on Jeremy's neck. Heat rushed to her face, mortified, and she mumbled, "Sorry about that. I'll just get out of your way."

She spun on her heel, ready to make her escape, only for Jeremy to catch her wrist in a firm grip and pull her back.

With a startled stumble, Kayla landed against his chest,eyes wide with surprise and nerves. "What's going on now?"

Every trace of earlier vulnerability vanished from Jeremy's features, replaced by his trademark,unreadable frost.

His voice was chilly as he asked, "Were you the one Lurking in my music room earlier tonight?"

Cornered, Kayla knew there was no way out. "Yes.I didn't mean to..."

Jeremy's eyes narrowed, scrutinizing her closely."You're familiar with that piano piece?"

"Only a little," she replied, downplaying her skills.

A follow-up question hung on Jeremy's lips, but the shrill ring of the doorbell interrupted, slicing through the tension.

He shot a look at the entrance and finally released her arm.′′V∈′Llfinish this conversation later. For now, go."

"Alright." Kayla wasted no time, slipping toward the exit with barely contained relief.

Her hasty departure deepened the scowl etched on Jeremy's face. A flicker of doubt crossed his mind.Why was she so scared of him?

At the door, Kayla was greeted by a middle-aged man dressed in server's attire, balancing a tray of coffee in his hands.

With a nod of thanks, Kayla stepped aside, holding the door for the server to enter.

Moving past the man, Kayla's eyes caught a suspicious flash beneath the tray. Instinct locked her in place,every sense on high alert. Why would a server be carrying a knife?

Inside the suite, Jeremy focused on smoothing the wrinkles from his jacket, his attention momentarily absorbed by his reflection. The server's approach appeared in the mirror, prompting a brief, distracted instruction. "Just leave the coffee on the table."

Not breaking stride, the server gave a curt nod, but his footsteps veered straight for Jeremy instead.

A jolt of unease shot through Jeremy. Spinning around,he saw the glint of steel as the man whipped out a knife and lunged at him.

"Look out!" Without thinking,Kayla burst back inside and slammed into the attacker, throwing him off balance.

The man spun on her, knife flashing dangerously close.

Jeremy yanked Kayla behind him. The blade sliced across her arm, drawing blood, but Jeremy retaliated instantly-his foot connected hard, launching the attacker through the doorway and into the hall.

Cradling her injured arm, Kayla hissed through clenched teeth, her features pinched with pain.

With a firm hold, Jeremy guided her to the sofa,settling her down. Leaning close, his voice dropped to a gentle murmur, concern etched in every syllable."Are you hurt anywhere else?"
###Chapter 64 Who Sent You


Kayla collapsed against Jeremy's chest, utterly drained,her head barely moving as she tried to signal she wNas all right.

The commotion upstairs sent Jeremy's bodyguards storming in. Before the server could bolt,they had him pinned.

Jeremy's voice sliced through the chaos, cold and absolute. "Keep him here. Bring the car around. We're heading to the hospital, now!"

Hearing the word "hospital" sent a jolt of panic through Kayla. If she set foot in a hospital, her pregnancy wouldn't stay secret for long.

Clutching Jeremy's sleeve in desperation, she begged,"Jeremy, please, don't take me to the hospital!"

For a moment, the hard line of Jeremy's jaw softened at the sight of her tear-filled eyes. "You're injured. Let a doctor take care of it."

"I'm begging you, no hospital!" Kayla clung to his arm,her grip desperate, leaving no room for argument.

Jeremy's resistance finally cracked. He gave a sharp nod to his guards, who hurried off to retrieve the first -aid kit.

Jeremy pulled open the kit and set to work. Kayla, refusing to let him fuss over her, caught his hand."I can do it myself."

Jeremy brushed her hand aside. "You saved me. Let me return the favor-stop pretending you're made of steel."

A flush crept across Kayla's cheeks as Jeremy steadily wrapped her wound, a gentle warmth stirring deep within her heart.

His fingertips brushed her skin, and as he leaned in,the heat of his breath danced against her jaw, making her heart skip and her muscles lock in anticipation.

She pressed her lips together, every limb taut and unmoving, caught in the charged silence stretching between them.

The soft, unblemished glow of her skin only sharpened the dryness in his throat-a pulse of longing he struggled to contain.

Lifting his gaze, Jeremy asked, "Why are you so tense?"

Kayla's blush deepened. She ducked her head,withdrawing slightly as she mumbled, "I can handle it myself."

"Don't move," he insisted, his tone leaving no room for protest.

He fought the urge to linger, steeling himself as he finished bandaging her, every second dragging out his restraint. Kayla's pulse thundered in her ears, her spine rigid,counting down the moments until he finally released her.

"You're good now. Just stay put for a bit," Jeremy said and straightened before popping open the top buttons of his shirt and heading for the door.

Only after he'd stepped away did the heavy air dissipate,letting Kayla breathe again.

Her eyes lingered on her bandaged arm, her nerves still buzzing. The image of that man lunging for Jeremy replayed in her mind-she hadn't hesitated for a second before throwing herself in the way.

Maybe it was because Jeremy had rescued her more than once; she felt bound by an unspoken debt.

Meanwhile, Jeremy strode into the empty guest room,where the server was kneeling on the floor, wrists tightly bound and twNo guards flanking him.

Jeremy stopped in front of the man, voice edged with ice. "Look at me."

When the server kept his gaze glued to the floor, one of the guards seized his chin and forced him to meet Jeremy's eyes.

Jeremy leaned down, studying every line etched into the server's weathered face. "Who sent you?"

The server, a grizzled, stubborn man in his fifties,qlared back with unflinching defiance. "I'm here because you ruined my daughter's life!"

Jeremy's brow tightened. "Your daughter? What are you talking about?"

The server lunged, only to be shoved back down by the guards. His voice cracked with outrage. "Don't act.clueless, Dewitt Nicolson! My daughter's just a college girl, but you destroyed her future! Your dirty money doesn't scare decent people like us!"

A cold chill swept through Jeremy as he pieced it together. Without missing a beat, he pulled out his phone and dialed Dewitt.

Dewitt's voice answered on speaker, nearly drowned out by the pulsing bass and rowdy laughter in the background. "Jeremy! What's up?"

Jeremy's voice carried the weight of absolute seriousness. "Dewitt, find a quiet spot. Now."

Dewitt ducked out the door,laughing under his breath."What's up, man? Miss me already? Heard you checked into a hotel with some woman tonight. Did she wear you out?"

Ignoring the quips, Jeremy dove right into the matter at hand. "Just get over here. Kayla got hurt, and it's on you."

Dewitt's laughter died in his throat."What?"

Jeremy offered no explanation; he simply ended the call. After ordering his men to keep the suspect under tight watch, Jeremy returned to Kayla's room. She lay across the bed, eyes dull and skin ghost-pale.

As soon as she spotted him, Kayla shot upright."Was that guy sent by one of your rivals?"

Jeremy shook his head, then reached over and peeled the blanket from her grip. "Enough. We're going to the hospital."

Kayla snatched the blanket back and flopped facedown, refusing to look at him. "Not a chance. I'm already patched up. There's no reason to drag me to a hospital."

Her stubbornness was clear as day-she wasn't budging, no matter what he said.
###Chapter 65 They Were About To Find Out She W...
I don't like owing people, so you better listen to me.".Jeremy pulled Kayla upright from the mattress,ignoring her protests. When she nearly lost her balance, his arm shot around her waist, catching her against him in a firm hold.

Her top slipped in the process, a single strap falling off her shoulder to reveal a strip of delicate skin and the edge of her black bra.

Heat rushed to her cheeks as she struggled to pull away. The more she tried, the further her shirt slid,drawing even more attention to her silhouette.

Jeremy's fingers flexed at her waist,tendons visible,clearly fighting to maintain control.

Now, they were so close that each breath mingled,and the air crackled with an electric tension.

Jeremy found himself staring at her lips, barely able to stop himself from leaning in. He silently cursed his lack of self-control.

"Hey, Jeremy, what's so urgent that you had to drag me all the way here?" Footsteps echoed from outside,followed by Dewitt's voice.

In a flash, Jeremy yanked a blanket over Kayla and  Pregnant settled her back onto the bed, making sure she was covered.

Still catching her breath, Kayla heard the door swing open.
Dewitt stepped inside with a knowing grin. "Did I just interrupt something spicy? Should I let you two finish?"
Jeremy's glare could have frozen fire. "Come barging in like that again, and you'll leave with broken fingers."

Feigning innocence, Dewitt tucked his hands behind his back. "Chill, man. You called about Kayla being hurt. Let me tae a look."

He stepped forward, but Jeremy blocked his path."You've seen enough. Out."

"Man, what's with the attitude?" Dewitt raised his palms in surrender, grinning sheepishly. "Fine, I won't stare. But seriously, Jeremy, she's not even your girlfriend. Why do you care so much?"

Jeremy's scowl only deepened. He looked seconds from tossing Dewitt out himself. "You've got one second to scram."

"Alright, alright! I'm gone!" Dewitt backpedaled,slipping out the door without another word.

As soon as Dewitt disappeared,Jeremy followed right behind him. Kayla stayed put until she was certain the hallway was  Pregnant silent. Only then did she crawl out from beneath the blanket.

Still flustered, she gave her cheeks a gentle slap, then slipped on her shoes and padded quietly toward the door. Just as she cracked it open, she caught their voices drifting in from down the hall.

Jeremy's tone was sharp as a blade. "That so-called server mistook me for you."

Dewitt's usual playfulness vanished, his voice growing more serious. "It's a mess. Months ago, I was at a hotel after a business dinner and saw a college girl being harassed. She'd been drugged and was completely out of it. I stayed the night to keep her safe. When her dad showed up, he jumped to conclusions, swore I'd done something terrible. I tried to explain, even sent people to talk to him, but he wouldn't listen. He wants me locked up for good.I was too swamped to fight it, so I just let it go."

Jeremy eyed him, not buying it just yet. "That the truth?"

Dewitt looked genuinely exasperated. "Come on, man.You think I'd mess with a college girl? I'm not that guy."

Jeremy's glare was nothing short of lethal, but he finally jerked his chin toward the lounge. "He's in there.Fix things."

Dewitt nodded toward the door to the bedroom."Kayla's alright,yeah? Want me to apologize in person?" Jeremy's answer was silent-a cold, unblinking stare.

Dewitt just shrugged, hands raised in surrender."Alright, I'll stay out of it. Just cut her some slack. She took that knife for you, remember?"

As Dewitt slipped away, Jeremy made his way back into the room and spotted Kayla curled up on the couch, her face contorted in pain as she clutched her stomach.

Instantly on edge, Jeremy rushed to her side."Where does it hurt? Tell me now."

Kayla tried to muster a smile, but her voice came out strained. "It's nothing,really."

She was hoping the cramp would ease up, but the ache in her belly only grew sharper with each second.

"No more arguing-we're going to the hospital."Without waiting for her to object, Jeremy swept her into his arms and marched out.

At the hospital, Jeremy flagged down a doctor and demanded Kayla be seen immediately.

He gently set Kayla down on a hospital bed, fixing her with a stern look. "Don't say a word. Let the professionals handle it."

A nurse rushed over, visibly anxious. "Are you Mr.Graham?"

Jeremy shot her a commanding look. "Get the doctor ant here right now and make sure she's taken care of!"

Kayla wanted to protest, but her energy was shot.Panic bubbled up inside her as she clung to the bed rails, her heart pounding with dread.

Kayla froze. They were about to find out she was pregnant!

"Mr. Graham, I need you to wait outside. I'll take care of her exam." The doctor stepped in, mask on, and wheeled Kayla's bed into the exam room.

###Chapter 66 Jeremy Sent Her Home
Jeremy paced the hospital corridor, restless. Dewitt called, explaining he'd smoothed things over with the guy and sent him home.

Dewitt's voice was laced with remorse over what happened to Kayla. "Total fluke. I didn't even realize that dude was staking out my hotel. I'll swing by with something for Kayla-apologize in person."

"Handle your mess. Don't let this kind of thing happen again." With that, Jeremy ended the call.

Just then, Zoe's name lit up on his screen. He answered.

A faint cough came through. "Hey, Jeremy. I'm home now.You good?"

Jeremy cast a quick glance at the exam room door,his voice dropping. "I've got something going on right now."

Zoe let out another exaggerated cough. "Still grinding this late? You've got to ease up sometime. If you need anything, I'm around. I mean, I can't fix your deadlines,but I can chat, at least. Oh-and my mom has been pestering me to invite you over for dinner..."

Zoe kept going, her words tumbling out. Jeremy's patience was wearing thin, but he stayed silent,waiting.

The exam room door swung open, and Jeremy saw his moment. "I've got to run, Zoe. I've got a lot on my plate."

Before she could reply, the line went dead. Zoe stared at her phone, insulted. She was practically hacking up a lung, and he didn't even ask if she was okay?

Wasn't he supposed to send someone right away with the cold medicine?

Still holding her phone, Zoe muttered, "Jeremy's probably swamped. I'll find him once he's got a moment."

Meanwhile, Jeremy tucked his phone away and approached the exam room.

The doctor stepped out, carrying a tray of used supplies from treating Kayla's injury.

Jeremy asked, "How is she?"

"I'm fine," Kayla called from the wheelchair. She didn't think she needed it, but the doctor hadn't budged.

Kayla held her bandaged arm, her face pale but her eyes still bright.

"Don't worry about me, Jeremy. The doctor saysI've just been running myself into the ground, and tonight didn't help. A couple of days of rest, and I'll be back." Jeremy looked to the doctor for confirmation. "That right?"

The doctor nodded. "Yes. The cut's slightly inflamed,but it's under control."

"Good." Jeremy gave a curt nod. Then, without another word, he turned and walked out.

Kayla exhaled a huge breath of relief. She turned to the doctor. "Thanks a lot, really."

By pure luck, it was the same doctor who'd handled her prenatal appointment. He already knew. She'd begged him not to say anything about her pregnancy.

He gave her a concerned look. "The cut's manageable,but the stress tonight stirred things up with the baby.You've got to take it easy. No more pushing yourself."

"I hear you, doc. Thanks," Kayla said as she headed out.

She assumed Jeremy had long gone, but as she stepped into the night air, his car was still out front.

One of the bodyguards approached. "It's late. Mr.Graham's taking you home."

Without thinking,Kayla blurted, "Can I say no?"

The bodyguard blinked, caught off guard.

Kayla spotted Jeremy watching from the car. She sighed. "Fine. Thanks for the ride." Inside the car, exhaustion crashed over her. She leaned her head against the window, barely staying awake. Jeremy's voice cut through. "You took a hit for me tonight. Getting you to the hospital is just evening the score."

Kayla figured he was trying to clear any debt,probably thinking she'd cling to this as leverage.

She murmured a quiet "okay" and let her eyes close.

Jeremy thought she hadn't heard. But when he looked over, she was out cold, her expression peaceful,lashes fanned out like soft ink strokes on her cheeks.

He found himself staring, caught off guard by the stillness in her face.

"We're here at her spot, Mr. Graham," the driver said suddenly.

Jeremy looked outside, his brow tightening as he took in the rough neighborhood. "Liam has got Kayla living somewhere like this?"
###Chapter 67 We Just Crossed Paths Last Night
Kayla was out cold, lost to the world no matter how many times Jeremy tried to shake her awake.

By the curb, one of the bodyguards hovered by the open car door, asking, "Mr. Graham, should we carry Her upstairs?"

Jeremy shot him a look and nodded curtly. "Send her home."

"Got it." The bodyguard moved in, trying to be helpful but ended up gripping Kayla right on her injured arm. Even in her sleep, pain flickered across her face and she let out a faint whimper, brow knotting in discomfort.

Jeremy's patience snapped. "Would it kill you to be careful?" His words came out sharp, slicing through the night air.

Flustered, the bodyguard stepped back,mumbling,"Sorry, Mr. Graham. Maybe you should do it? She might get hurt if we keep trying."

Without another word, Jeremy stooped down and swept Kayla into his arms.

Kayla shifted unconsciously, nestling closer against his chest, as if searching for comfort even in her dreams. With her unit number already in mind, Jeremy carried her all the way to her home.

Inside, the space was small but inviting, the. soft lamplight revealing neatly stacked work papers and the faintest hint of lavender in the air. Hle noticed the pile of paperwork on the dining table,evidence of her endless late nights.

Cradling her, Jeremy stepped into the bedroom,pushed aside a scatter of plush pink toys at the head of her bed, and set her down tenderly.

As Jeremy turned to leave, Kayla, half-lost in sleep,instinctively latched onto his hand and y/anked him off balance.He toppled onto the mattress beside her, his weight making the bed dip with a dull thud.

"Grandma, don't go," Kayla murmured,eyes squeezed shut, her words tangled with the haze of a dream.Even in sleep, she reached for the only person who had ever made her feel truly safe-her grandmother.

Jeremy caught himself with one hand pressed firmly into the mattress, careful not to crush the girl clinging to him. Her fingers locked tight around his own,refusing to let go.

Suddenly, a shrill ringtone cut through the quiet,Kayla's phone buzzing from somewhere in the folds of her blanket.

Jeremy tried to wriggle free, reaching awkwardly for the phone, but Kayla rolled over, pinning his hand Night under her body.

"Kayla, let go," he growled, his mouth close to her ear,his voice low and cool.

Kayla, blissfully oblivious, only nuzzled deeper into her dreams, the faintest smile curving her lips

With no other choice, Jeremy lay stuck, trapped by the Kayla's stubborn grip.

Minutes dragged into hours, each second testing his patience. At last, after what felt like an eternity, Kayla shifted in her sleep, rolling away and releasing his numb hand.

No sooner had he pulled free than her phone started ringing again, the persistent call slicing through the room every ten minutes, as relentless as a ticking clock.

Jeremy snatched up the phone, his eyes flicking to the caller ID-"Dummy."

He didn't need to guess; that was Liam's number,without a doubt.

Kayla,still half-lost in sleep, groaned at the relentless ringing and yanked the blanket over her head, trying to block out the world.

Switching off her phone, Jeremy slipped out of the bedroom and flexed his tingling hand, working the feeling back as he made his way down the stairs and out to the waiting car. The bodyguard at the curb eyed him with concern."Are you alright, Mr. Graham?"

Jeremy, ever composed, tucked his hand behind his back and kept his expression unreadable. "I'm fine.Let's go."

With that, the car eased away from the curb,melting into the qquiet of the early morning streets.

Kayla didn't stir until midday, when the crash and thud of her neighbor's home renovation rattled through the walls and dragged her back to consciousness.

She squinted at the bedside clock, bolting upright in alarm. "It's noon?" Pain jolted through her injured arm as she moved too fast.

"Ouch." Cautiously, Kayla checked the wound-no fresh blood, just the faint sting of healing. Relieved,she pushed herself up, swept back the curtains, and let sunlight spill across room.

Last night flickered through her mind in fragments-Jeremy taking her to the hospital, then... nothing. The rest was a blank.

"Did he actually carry me upstairs?" she murmured,half amused, half disbelieving.

She shook her head, unable to piece together the gap in her memory, and finally let it go.

She grabbed her phone, realized it was off, and nowered it back on, Instantly, aa torrent of missed calls from Liam flashed across the screen. HHe'd clearly found ways to pester her using every number he could get his hands on, block list or not.

Kayla rolled her eyes and tossed the phone aside,determined to ignore him. After a quick shower and a change into fresh clothes, she was just about to head out when her phone rang again. This time, Archie's name flashed across the display.

"Kayla, I heard you ran into some trouble at the hotel last night," Archie said, his voice laced with concern.

Kayla blinked, caught off guard. "How'd you find out so fast? But I'm fine, really-just a little hiccup."

"If you're not feeling well, take it easy. Work can wait,"Archie replied, sounding unusually gentle.

Kayla hesitated, eyebrows arching in surprise. "Did Jeremy tell you?"
A quiet chuckle rumbled through the phone."So,he was with you last night? I only got a text this morning saying you'd been hurt and should take a few days off."

Taken aback,Kayla could only laugh awkwardly. "I just happened to run into him, that's all. There's nothing more to it. I can work today."

But Archie wouldn't budge. "He personally asked me to give you leave. I don't want our partners thinking |work my people to the bone."

Realizing she'd lost this round, Kayla sighed,agreeing to take the day off and promising herself she'd return to work tomorrow if she felt up to it.

Before hanging up, Archie cleared his throat, suddenly sounding far too interested. "Kayla, what's really going on between you and Jeremy?"

Kayla's heart skipped a beat, and she blurted out,′′Vjust crossed paths last night, that's all. Nothing else."
###Chapter 68 Jeremy Asked Her To Dinner
Archie's laughter rang out through the phone. "Come.on, Kayla, I just asked how you and Jeremy bumped into each other last night. Why so jittery? You're family, after all. It's not like you're strangers."

Forcing a chuckle, Kayla responded, "You're right."

"Take it easy and don't rush back. Focus on getting better first," Archie said before hanging up.

Kayla slumped onto the couch, flipping through her contacts until she spotted Jeremy's office number-the one Edwin had slipped her during her last visit to North Investment, supposedly to make work calls easier.

Since Jeremy had gone out of his way to bring her home last night, the least she could do was say thank you.

She hesitated for a moment, nerves prickling beneath her skin, then took a deep breath and pressed dial.

Jeremy picked up on the first ring.

Suddenly nervous, Kayla twisted a loose thread on her sleeve and tried to steady her voice. "Jeremy? It's Kayla." A pause,then Jeremy's voice came through, unruffled."What is it?"

Kayla hurried to get the words out. "I just wanted to thank you for helping me last night."

Jeremy sounded almost amused. "You jumped in front of that guy for me. This was the least I could do.Don't mention it."

Heat crept up Kayla's cheeks. She fumbled for an exit."Alright, I'll let you get back to work."

Jeremy's clipped tone broke in before Kayla could hang up. "Seven-thirty tonight. Sunshine Garden Restaurant."

She froze, caught off guard by the abrupt invitation.

"Consider it a thank-you, Kayla. You saved my life last night. Dinner's on me," Jeremy added.

The line went dead before she could muster a reply.

Kayla stared at the phone, her thoughts swirling.Jeremy had just invited her to dinner. Was it really just gratitude, or something more complicated? Regret nipped at her-maybe making that call was a mistake.

"He's just returning the favor," she muttered, trying to convince herself it was nothing more.

Restless, she straightened up her tiny apartment,forcing herself to stay busy. When her energy flagged,she took a short nap. Later, feeling steadier,she pulled on a jacket that concealed her bandaged arm,then hailed a cab to the care facility.

She ducked into a pharmacy along the way and bought a bottle of prenatal vitamins, stashing them deep in her bag.

As the cab rattled through city traffic, Kayla's hand drifted to her stomach, her thoughts drifting to the fragile life growing inside her.

Once she divorced Liam, she was determined to leave this city behind-she, her baby, and Marsha,starting over somewhere new.

The cab finally rolled up to the entrance.

Kayla paid the driver and headed inside, weaving past quiet nurses until she reached Marsha's door.

Laughter spilled into the hallway. Kayla peeked in and saw Liam perched on the edge of the bed, grinning as he waved two plush toys in the air.

Kayla stepped inside,greeted by the dizzying scent of fresh blooms. The table nearly disappeared beneath a mountain of extravagant gifts, each one bearing Liam's unmistakable touch.

"Kayla!" Marsha called out, clapping her hands in delight.

Liam flashed a gentle smile. "Perfect timing, Kayla. I was just keeping Marsha company. Why don't you sit with us?" Ignoring his invitation, Kayla set down her bag of fruit with a stiff, deliberate motion, her gaze icy as it locked onto Liam. "Let's step into the hallway."

The corridor outside was silent as Kayla squared her shoulders, facing Liam with barely disguised irritation.

Liam tried to hold on to his easygoing smile, but it faltered. "What's with the long face? You show up looking like you've swallowed a lemon-Marsha's worried about you."

Kayla let out a short, bitter laugh. "I told you before -leave my grandmother out of this. How many times do I have to say it? I'm not in the mood to repeat myself."

Trying to soften the mood, Liam lowered his voice,offering a placating look. "Kayla, Marsha enjoys my visits. I plan to keep coming. I called you last night,but you didn't answer. Maybe you were tied up.Anyway, there's something I need to tell you."

Before Kayla could get a word in, Liam whipped a folded sheet of paper from his pocket and thrust it toward her, his eyes shining with anticipation.

"Here-Tricia's resignation. I've signed it. She's out of the picture for good. You'll never have to see her again. I promise."

Kayla's gaze flicked over the letter, her lips curling into a taunting,ice-cold smile that made Liam falter for a heartbeat, transfixed despite himself. She plucked the letter from his hand, arching a brow with cool disdain. "You think firing Tricia is all it takes to win me back? Keep dreaming, Liam. I don't recycle old mistakes."

With that, she smacked the letter across his cheek and stalked back into the room, slamming the door so hard it rattled the frame.

Left alone in the hallway, Liam's face darkened, his fists clenching in silent frustration. "I've already said I'm sorry, Kayla. Why can't you just meet me halfway?"

From behind the closed door, Kayla's voice rang out,razor-sharp."I said-get lost!"
###Chapter 69 One Compliment, And You..
Kayla arrived at the Sunshine Garden Restaurant as the.clock struck seven.

The restaurant was eerily still. Not a single diner lingered, only a handful of staff gliding through the empty space.

A courteous waiter approached and asked, "Ma'am, are you Mrs. Graham?"

Kayla inclined her head. "Yes, that's me."

"Please,this way. Mr. Graham is waiting upstairs." With that, the waiter led Kayla up to the terrace on the second floor.

A long table gleamed beneath an array of delicate,artfully plated dishes.

By the railing, Jeremy waited with his back to her.Dressed in a crisp, dark shirt-collar open, sleeves casually roled-he radiated an effortless authority.

As he pivoted, the overhead lights caught the strong lines of his face, his features sharp yet never severe,a storm of quiet power simmering behind his eyes.Shadows played across his expression, lending him a dangerous, almost magnetic edge. IKayla's breath caught, lher heart thudding as she tamped dowm the rusl of merves and awe. "Hi, Jeremy."

Jeremy suid a chair out with a smooth gesture and offfiered, "Have a seat."

Kayla eased herself down across from him, unable to tear her gaze from the lavish feast spread out before her. The savory aroma made her mouth water-she'd barely eaten all day, having only managed a quick snack between caring for Marsha at the care facility.Now her stomach rumbled loudly in protest.

Jeremy's sharp eyes caught the hunger in her expression. He leaned in, his voice soft and inviting."Every dish here was made just for you. Don't hold back-eat."

"Is there a reason you asked me here tonight?"Though Kayla was eager to dig in, she wanted to clear her doubts first.

Jeremy's gaze turned inscrutable, dark eyes glinting in the low light. "Eat first. We'll talk after," he said,leaving no room for argument.

With no choice but to comply, Kayla picked up her utensils.

She moved with practiced grace, every motion elegant and unhurried. The restaurant's golden glow brushed over her face, highlighting her delicate features and the tired shadows beneath her eyes Across the table, Jeremy's own hunger stirred.Without another word, he reached for his knife and fork to join her.

Kayla kept Jeremy in her peripheral vision, wary but trying to mask her nervès. Thankfully, he seemed content to focus on his meal, barely making a sound as he ate.

She released a breath she hadn't realized she was holding,her mind racing with plans to eat quickly and slip out at the first opportunity.

As the last dishes were cleared, a waiter entered,flanked by several burly bodyguards who wheeled in a gleaming grand piano. "Mr. Graham, the piano is here."

Kayla's curiosity sparked as she watched the scene unfold."What's all this for?"

Jeremy set his utensils aside and dabbed his mouth with a crisp napkin, his face composed and unreadable."I'd like you to play that piece from the other night."

Realization dawned, and Kayla's pulse quickened.So that was his real motive for inviting her here.

She still didn't know who'd composed that melody,but she could sense its significance to Jeremy. If she botched it, she might offend him-a risk she wasn't eager to take.

She pressed her lips together, weighing her words lf At Me before replying softly, "That night, I was just sight-reading. I haven't practiced much. Maybe you'd rather have a professional play instead?"

Jeremy's gaze sharpened, his tone brooking no argument. "I want to hear you play it. Just play from the heart-don't worry about anything else."

With no room to protest, Kayla forced a hesitant nod."Alright. I'll give it a shot."

She rose from her chair and approached the piano,her fingertips gliding over the glossy keys. The instrument was nothing short of exquisite-each key promised a lush, resonant tone that seemed to vibrate in the air even before she played.

Across the table, Jeremy lounged back in his seat,his eyes never leaving her. His gaze was cool and inscrutable as he motioned for her to begin.

With a quiet breath, Kayla sank onto the bench.Resigned, she positioned her hands and let the first notes spill out.

Her slender fingers danced across the keys, weaving a melody that was both delicate and bittersweet. The music drifted through the restaurant, each note shimmering in the air, haunting and beautiful all at once.

Jeremy rested his chin in his palm, watching her every move. As the song built, his thoughts began to wander, slipping into a vivid daydream.Back when he was just a boy. he sneaked out of bed and lingered quietly in the hallway, watching his mother's silhouette at the piano.

After she wrapped up, she greeted him with a gentle smile and summon him over.

"Come here, Jay."

He scampered to her side, his eyes wide with wonder."What song was that, Mom? It's beautiful."

"If you want, I'll teach you," she said, sweeping him onto her lap and guiding his tiny fingers across the cool, ivory keys, her arms wrapped protectively around him.



Kayla let the final note fade into the hushed restaurant, her hands resting lightly on the keys. With a soft turn, she looked at Jeremy and announced, "I'm done."

Jeremy hadn't looked away once. He stood rooted in place, tall and imposing, eyes unreadable in the dim light.

The silence stretched, prickling with tension, until a flicker of doubt crept into Kayla's chest. Had she messed up?

After what felt like ages, Jeremy finally moved. He strode over, every step unhurried, and stopped beside her,his shadow falling over the keys. "Where did you  pick up that piece?"

Kayla answered quietly, "I learned piano as a kid. The sheet music was in your piano room-I just memorized it after glancing through."

He rested his fingers lightly on the keys, their closeness crackling with electricity. "You've got a good ear."

Caught off guard by the sudden intimacy, Kayla fumbled to her feet-only to misjudge herstep and stumble.

Before she could right herself, Jeremy's arms circled her waist, steadying her as they both swayed dangerously close to the piano.

Kayla's heart thundered against her ribs. She was pressed against his chest. Her lashes fluttered as she dared to look up, catching the sharp line of his jaw and the unguarded warmth flickering in his eyes.

His hand lingered at her waist, the touch firm yet unexpectedly gentle. For a man famed for his iron self-control, he felt his composure slipping in her presence.

Jeremy dipped his head, his voice edged with a teasing warmth."One compliment, and you throw yourself at me?"
###Chapter 70 She Was Harassed
The tension between Kayla and Jeremy snapped the second he spoke. Whatever spark had lingered fizzled instantly.

Flustered and clearly annoyed, Kayla muttered,"You've got the wrong idea. I just tripped. That's all.You can let go now."

Jeremy knew he was pushing boundaries, but something about holding her-her warmth,her weight in his arms-made him hesitate.

Every time he touched Kayla, that strange, nagging feeling returned. He had a feeling that she was the woman from that night. But that wasn't possible,was it?

His thoughts were tangled, and for once, he couldn't think straight.

Kayla tried to break free, but his grip didn't loosen.Frustrated, she stomped hard on his foot. The sharp pain made Jeremy flinch, and she took the chance to shove him away and put some distance between them."Don't cross the line!"
As the warmth of her body left his arms, the intensity in Jeremy's eyes faded. He stared at her. "Every time you see me,you panic like a deer in headlights. Why?" Kayla's heart thudded against her ribs, but she kept her tone steady. "Your reputation precedes you. I've heard what kind of man you are-direct, ruthless. In Trark,you hold power. It's only natural to be wary."

It was a decent answer. But something about her explanation was off.

"Well, well. There you are. I went to the hospital,but none of you were there." Dewitt's voice cut through the moment. He strolled in casually, dripping confidence.

He wore a sharp, tailored gray jacket, his hair slicked back with precision, pulling off the look of a smooth operator.

His sudden entrance shattered the tension. Kayla gave him a polite nod.

Jeremy's expression darkened. "What are you doing here?"

Dewitt grinned. "Kayla got hurt because of me. I'm here to apologize properly. I've got a VIP lounge at Nightfall waiting for us. Drinks on me."

Nightfall was Dewitt's pride and joy. The kind of place where money flew like paper and everyone acted like they ruled the world.

Kayla didn't miss a beat. "Thanks, but I'm heading home early tonight."

Dewitt clutched his chest like she'd shot him. "That hurts. Come on, let me make it up to you. I'll get you anything you want. Name it-moon, stars, you got it."

Kayla crossed her arms. "You're laying it on thick. Not buying it."

Jeremy suddenly chimed in, "Dewitt doesn't hand out invites for no reason. He's being serious. If you walk away, it won't look good."

Kayla hesitated. With Jeremy backing Dewitt,refusing again would just come off as rude.

Dewitt clapped his hands. "Great. Car's ready. Let's go."

Kayla followed Dewitt out. Jeremy stayed behind for a moment, his eyes drifting to the piano in the corner of the room.

Edwin stepped up beside him. "Sir, it's strange. That piece Kayla played-hardly anyone knows it. Could mean something."

Jeremy was thinking about how Kayla had avoided his eyes earlier, like she was hiding something.

He turned to Edwin. "Run the check again.Everything about the woman from that night-I want it all."

Edwin blinkedd. "We've already checked. It was Zoe.You want me to keep digging?”

Jeremy's voice stayed calm and steady. "Just keep digging."

The VIP lounge at Nightfall was everything you'd
expect-plush leather seats, flashing lights, shelves full of high-end liquor.

Music thumped through the walls. A couple of women in bunny ears were dancing on stage, trying to catch attention and earn tips.

Dewitt looked completely at home, cracking jokes with a few business buddies while the drinks kept coming without pause.

Kayla sat on the edge of the couch, quietly sipping water. The atmosphere wasn't her thing, and she couldn't wait to leave. Ten more minutes-just enough to be polite-then she was out.

A drunken man stumbled into the room and locked eyes on her, grinning like he'd struck gold. "Hey,beautiful," he slurred. "What's with the water? Come have a drink with me."

Kayla leaned back a bit, the heavy stench of whiskey on his breath making her stomach churn. Forcing a tight smile, she said, "I don't drink."

He laughed and pointed a wobbly finger. "Come on,don't be shy. Just one. Hell, I'll give you a million if you say yes." His eyes slid down her body,stopping at her chest. Kayla's stomach turned. She took a step back."Seriously. I don't drink."

His voice dropped, slimy and aggressive. "You're in a place like this, dressed like that? Stop pretending you're different." Then he grabbed a glass and tried to press it into her hand, the other arm snaking behind her head.

Right then, Jeremy stepped through the door. His expression darkened the second he saw what was happening.

"| said no!" Kayla shouted, shoving the man off her.The glass slipped and shattered on the floor.

The guy's mood shifted fast. "Ungrateful bitch!" He raised his hand to slap her.

But he never got the chance. Jeremy's hand caught his wrist mid-swing. The man gasped,his arm frozen in place, pain flashing across his face.

Jeremy twisted hard and flung him against the wall."Get out."
###Chapter 71 I'm Going To Invite Jeremy Over
The instant the man caught sight of Jeremy, the color.drained from his face. His knees buckled,sending him crashing to the floor. His voice shook as he pleaded,"Mr. Graham, I swear-I had no idea she was with you I'm sorry, I didn't mean any harm!"

Jeremy didn't spare him a glance. With a lazy flick of his wrist, he signaled to his bodyguards, who immediately hauled the man away like he was nothing but garbage.

Dewitt strode up to Kayla, his tone threaded with worry. "Kayla,are you alright?"

She managed a steady nod, doing her best to appear unfazed. "Yeah. I'm fine."

Dewitt's jaw tightened. "That's on me. I should've told them you're a friend of mine. I'll straighten that idiot out later-he clearly didn't know who he was dealing with."

Kayla stayed silent, her eyes following Jeremy as he sauntered over and settled beside her, cool as ever.

She lowered her voice, offering a quiet, "Thank you."

The words drifted over. Jeremy's hand stalled,hovering above his glass, but he didn't reply. Around the lounge, everyone had already made the connection. For Jeremy to intervene, Kayla was clearly someone he cared about.

Guests began rising from their seats, drifting over to Kayla with drinks in hand. They assured her that soda or juice was just fine. Nobody wanted to miss their shot at getting on Jeremy's good side.

Left with little choice, Kayla managed a polite smile and lifted her glass a few times, silently wishing the formalities would end.

She barely exchanged more than a few words with Dewitt or his circle before the conversation devolved into business talk that barely interested her.

Seizing the opening,Kayla quietly excused herself and slipped down the hallway toward the restroom. Inside,she lingered at the sink, letting the cool water run over her hands. From the far end of the tiled room,voices floated over-two women gossiping as they fussed in front of the mirror.

Both were dressed to the nines in tight, barely-there skirts, layers of bold makeup, and a cloud of cloying perfume. They crowded the mirror, smoothing on another coat of lip gloss and batting at false lashes.

One woman let out a sharp, theatrical sigh. "Did you catch her tonight? Acting like she owns the place. She really thinks she's Jeremy's wife already."

Kayla froze, hands hovering in the stream, the water rushing over her knuckles.

Her companion, a woman in a striking blue dress,clicked her tongue. "She's always been like that.Remember in school? Always needed to be the center of attention. This gathering is just another excuse to brag about Jeremy. Marley, your man runs a whole company and you don't act like that."

Marley Hayes flipped her hair with a sneer. "That's because we actually have class. She's just an attention -seeking fool."

The woman in blue let out a sharp laugh. "Let's go.Maybe she'll put on another little show for us."

They strode off, heels clicking down the hallway.Kayla stayed at the sink, her face unreadable,but her jaw tightened just slightly.

It didn't take much guesswork to figure out who they were talking about-Zoe.

As Kayla headed out to grab her bag and make a quiet exit, she nearly collided with a group turning the corner.

At the front stood Zoe herself. She halted, eyes narrowing in surprise. "Kayla? What the hell are you doing here?"

Kayla met her stare, taking in the women on either side-recognizing the two bathroom gossips immediately. Their bodies tensed the moment Kayla appeared.Marley's face went pale as she sidled closer to Zoe."Hold up, you two actually know each other?"

Zoe crossed her arms, her nose tilted upward."Know her? She used to mooch off my family until we caught her stealing. We threw her out on the street."

A thin, mocking smile played on Kayla's lips, though her eyes stayed icy. The whole scene dredged up that old memory-everyone had blamed her, but the real thief had been Zoe, twisting the truth with effortless ease.

Zoe's friends whipped around to glare at Kayla, their expressions brimming with disdain. "Are you serious?She's a thief? Zoe, you can't trust someone like her,"one of them sneered.

Zoe let out a sharp laugh. "Trust her? Not a chance."

Unfazed, Kayla cocked her head and offered a delicate,knowing smile. "Or maybe you're all just scared I'll repeat what I overheard in the restroom.Something about Zoe's boyfriend being imaginary and her acting like an attention-seeking fool?"

The words landed like a slap. Marley and her crew went ghost-white, scrambling to cover their tracks."That's a lie! We never said anything like that. She's making it up!"

Zoe's glare hardened as she looked at her so-called friends. She knew exactly what they really thought- none of them believed Jeremy was truly hers. Maybe it was time to finally prove them all wrong.

Kayla let out a soft, almost taunting laugh. "Too bad I didn't catch it on video. That would've been a real treat to play back."

Marley, flustered, grabbed Zoe's arm, her voice desperate. "Don't listen to her, Zoe. You know we'd never talk behind your back."

At that moment, Zoe spotted Edwin heading toward the VIP room. Her face brightened as if she'd found an escape hatch. She turned on Kayla, barking,"Wait here. I'm going to invite Jeremy over."
###Chapter 72 Don't Mess With Her Again
Kayla stepped back into the private lounge where Marley and the others were gathered. Everyone was waiting for Zoe to come back.

The room pulsed with whispers. "Is she actually bringing Jeremy in here? Seriously? Could be all talk.Maybe she's bluffing."

Marley gave a lazy shrug. "Let's just wait. We'll know soon enough."

Kayla made for the door, but they blocked her path.

Still steaming from earlier, Marley strutted over in her stilettos, a bitter smirk on her lips. "You must be the sad little sister Zoe's always talking about. So what if you overheard us in the bathroom? You think Zoe's going to take your word over ours?"

Kayla shot her a bored glance, her eyes drifting over Marley like she wasn't worth a second thought. Trash always had a way of sticking with its own kind.

"Whether she believes me or not doesn't matter,"Kayla said coolly. "I heard everything."

Marley crossed her arms, her smug grin widening. "No wonder Zoe's always complaining about you. Your mom was a bitch, and you're just like her." The mention of her mother snapped something inside Kayla. Her fists clenched tight, her expression hardening like stone.

Another girl chimed in, barely hiding her grin."Zoe said her mom cheated. That's why her parents divorced."

Marley added with a smirk, "If her mom was like that,what do you expect from her?"

Kayla's fury ignited in a flash. She stepped forward and slapped Marley so fast. The loud crack echoed through the room.

Everything froze.

Marley stumbled back, grabbing her cheek,eyes wide."Did you just hit me?"

Right then, Zoe walked in with Jeremy. She rushed to Marley and threw her arms in front of her like a shield."Kayla! How could you hit my friend?"

Kayla didn't hesitate. She turned and landed another slap-this one on Zoe. Harder.

Zoe stumbled back a few steps, eyes glistening as tears welled up. She stared at Kayla, stunned. "Why would you hit me like that?"

She took a shaky step back, staring at Kayla like the injured lead in a drama, then turned to Jeremy, silently pleading.Jeremy stood still, hands in his pockets, not saying a word.

"You talk way too much." Kayla grabbed a throw pillow off the couch and hurled it straight at Zoe. Her aim was sharp-her so-called friends caught some of it too.

Screams erupted as chaos broke loose.

Kayla didn't stop. She charged, cornering in seconds,swinging the pillow over and over again. Makeup smeared, someone's contact lens popped out,and the room turned into a mess.

Jeremy watched from the side, clearly uneasy.

Kayla looked like a storm set loose. Whatever strength she had, it surged now. One by one,the girls backed down, slinking to the floor, begging her to stop.

Finally,Kayla stopped herself-remembering the baby.She grabbed a wine bottle from the table and smashed it against the floor in front of them. "Say one more word about my mom, and next time, it won't be a pillow. It'll be your face."

She turned, walking straight past Jeremy without a glance. Zoe staggered to her feet, hair tangled, dress torn,sniffles loud and pitiful. She limped over to Jeremy,eyes glassy. "Why is she acting like this? She hit me so hard."

Jeremy didn't have all the facts, but he knew Kayla.She wasn't reckless. If she lost it, something must've pushed her too far.

He looked at Zoe without emotion. "If you came here.to have fun, then stick to that. Don't drag drama into it. I'm covering the tab tonight."

Then he turned and walked away, never once glancing back.

Zoe stood frozen, her mouth slightly open, watching him disappear.

Marley rushed over, still holding her face. "Wait, I thought you said he was your boyfriend! Why didn't he help us?"

Zoe's expression twisted, rage bubbling up. "Because of you idiots! Why would you start something with Kayla? This was my chance to talk to him, and you blew it!"

Marley stared at her. "We ruined it?"

Remembering Jeremy was hanging out with his friends next door, Zoe took a long breath to calm down."Fine. Whatever. It's my fault. Kayla's been losing it lately. She's unhinged. Don't mess with her again."

Outside, under the glow of the club sign, Jeremy stepped out and spotted Kayla waiting by the curb for a ride. He walked up quietly behind her, hands in his pockets."Want a lift?"
###Chapter 73 She Wasn't Pregnant
Kayla gave a polite smile and shook her head. "No,thanks. I'll grab a cab."

Jeremy didn't say a word. His driver had already pulled the car up to the curb, and without waiting, Jeremy got in first. He didn't close the door behind him.He left it open, expecting her to follow.

Kayla hesitated. Standing there felt awkward, and turning him down again would seem rude. Reluctantly,she climbed in after him.

Inside the car, the music was soft and calm, nothing like the noise and drama of the club they'd just left behind.

Kayla noticed Jeremy wasn't leaning back or resting with his eyes closed. She hesitated for a second, then began, "About what happened tonight..."

"| don't interfere in women's business," Jeremy responded with no real emotion, casually turning the ring on his finger.

Kayla hesitated again, then finally asked, "Zoe said you plan to marry her. Is that true?"

Silence fell over the car, thick and heavy.Jeremy didn't respond, and after a moment, Kayla tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear and mumbled, "Sorry. I wasn't trying to pry. Just curious."

Jeremy let out a dry scoff. "Seems like everyone's curious about who I'm going to marry. You and Zoe clearly don't get along. Did my father make you invite her to have dinner with the Graham family?"

Kayla blinked and gave a small nod. "Yes. I'm still his granddaughter-in-law. I wouldn't dare go against his orders."

Jeremy's eyes rested on her face, taking in the quiet defiance in her expression. He let out a dry,mocking breath. "So now you're trying to play the victim with me?"

Kayla coughed quietly and didn't answer.

The silence stretched out until the car finally pulled up in front of her place.

Just as she reached for the door handle, Jeremy spoke. "Liam's company must be circling the drain if he's letting you stay in a dump like this."

Kayla paused, then straightened and replied, "Liam and I have been living separately for a while. What I do now has nothing to do with him. You should head home and get some rest. Goodnight."

With that, she stepped out and shut the door behind her,walking away. 
Jeremy watched her walk off,her posture straight and her steps fast. "Just mention Liam and she lights up like a fuse," he muttered to himself.

...
Kayla's arm had mostly healed. That morning,she made time for a prenatal check-up. Inside the ultrasound room, the doctor studied her scan carefully and said, "Everything looks good, but the next couple of months are important. Try to avoid stress and take it easy."

Kayla let out a soft breath. Relief spread through her chest. Over the past month, the baby had quietly claimed a place in her heart. Even if it hadn't been planned, it was hers-and she wanted to protect it.

"Thank you, doctor." Kayla slipped back into her clothes and left the room.

As she walked down the corridor, Tricia happened to look up and caught a glimpse of her turning the corner. "Kayla?" She rushed to catch up.

Kayla stood in line at the pharmacy, head down,scrolling through messages in her work group chat.When she glanced up, she caught sight of Tricia's reflection in the glass window ahead, watching her from a distance.

She frowned slightly. Using the crowd to her advantage, she quietly stepped out of the queue and disappeared.Tricia, distracted for only a moment, suddenly found Kayla was gone. She glanced around in confusion."Huh? Where'd she go?"

"Looking for me?" The voice came from behind,startling Tricia so much that she spun around,clutching her chest.

Kayla stood there, arms crossed, a small pharmacy bag dangling from one hand, her expression cool.

Tricia clutched her purse tighter,her voice sharp."Are you pregnant?"

Kayla raised an eyebrow, then laughed-light but cutting.She looked Tricia straight in the eye and asked,"Who told you that? Or do you wish to get pregnant yourself?"

Tricia's face stiffened. She instinctively moved the medical report behind her back, trying to hide it.

Kayla's smile grew as she watched Tricia squirm.Earlier, she'd seen Tricia's name flash on the screen but had brushed it off, thinking it must be someone else with the same name.

"Kayla, are you making fun of me?" Tricia snapped,clearly rattled.

"Touchy, aren't we? Let me guess..." Kayla said,twirling the medicine bag by its string. "You thought you were pregnant. And when the result said no, you couldn't hide your disappointment." Tricia's cheeks turned bright red. She stepped forward,ready to argue, but something in Kayla's gaze stopped her cold.

The truth was, Tricia hadn't been feeling like herself lately and started thinking she might be pregnant.The idea actually excited her-she thought it might finally make Liam take her seriously. But the test results were a letdown. She wasn't pregnant.

Kayla could see it all over her face. She gave a short laugh and said, "Don't worry. You've always been good at inserting yourself where you don't belong. If you try hard enough, I'm sure you'll manage to have Liam's baby one day."
Tricia's glare sharpened. Her voice turned icy. "And what about you? Why were you coming out of the obstetrics department? You really think I'm that naive?"
###Chapter 74 Throwing Herself Into His Arms
Kayla hurled the bag she was holding straight into.Tricia's arms, her voice shap and unwavering. "Who said I came out of the obstetrics department? There are several others right next to it. I caught a cold.What's so strange about seeing a doctor?"

Tricia caught the bag, her expression tight with suspicion. She quickly tore it open and dumped everything out.

All she found were a few boxes of standard cold medicine. Nothing even remotely related to pregnancy.

A flicker of disappointment and simmering anger passed through Tricia's eyes,but there was no way to vent it now.

Stepping closer, Kayla raised her hand and tilted Tricia's chin up. Her presence was firm and commanding,leaving no room for challenge."You're mad you lost your job at Perennia Group. I get it. But that's between you and Liam. A word of advice-stay out of my way. Or don't be surprised when things turn ugly."

With that, Kayla gave her a hard shove.

Tricia staggered backward on her high heels and lost her balance, crashing to the floor. The noise caught people's attention, and soon, a wave of curious and judgmental stares turned their way.
Kayla casually brushed off her hands and let out a cold scoff. "Since you've put your hands all over it, I don't want it anymore. I'll just ask the doctor for a new one."

Without a second glance, she turned and walked off,her stride steady and confident.

Tricia, cheeks burning with humiliation, scrambled up and rushed out of the hospital.

Once she was sure Tricia had left, Kayla circled back to the pharmacy counter to pick up her actual prescription-prenatal vitamins. Thankfully,she'd been extra cautious. If Tricia had seen the real medication,everything would've been exposed.

As soon as Kayla returned to her desk in Newton Group, Archie called her into his office.

Seated behind his desk, he flipped through a stack of documents. "You've been doing a solid job with the materials lately-much better than my secretary,to be honest. I should've brought you into the company a lot earlier."

Kayla gave a polite smile. "Thank you, Mr. Newton. I'm still learning."

Archie placed the documents on his desk and clasped his hands together."With your skills, staying in a junior role in the planning department doesn't really make sense. Aside from the project you're already working on. I've got a few more lined up. If you manage to complete them well, it'll be a big win for you."

"I'd be happy to handle them," Kayla said with a nod.

Archie turned to his secretary and instructed her to hand over the new assignments. One of them stood out-a pending contract with North Investment, which needed to be signed before the end of the day.

Kayla paused slightly as she flipped through the files,her fingers stopping on that one contract.

Archie noticed. "Is anything wrong?"

She quickly shook her head. "No, it's all good. I'll handle it."

"Good." Archie gave a small smile and watched her leave the office.

As soon as Kayla stepped out, his secretary entered."Mr. Newton, that North Investment deal has been stuck for ages. We've tried getting it signed multiple times with no luck. You really think Kayla can convince Mr.Graham?"

Archie didn't look up from the papers in front of him.His voice was calm, almost flat. "I just believe she's got what it takes."

Kayla caught a cab to North Investment and spoke with the receptionist, who granted her access.
The elevator lobby was crowded with people waiting around patiently. She spotted one elevator about to close and made a quick dash. "Wait!"

People stared at her strangely, but she didn't notice.

Right before the elevator doors closed, Kayla squeezed her way in, accidentally bumping into someone. Her forehead hit a solid chest, and the stack of documents she was holding flew from her hands,scattering across the floor.

She lost her balance, but before she could fall,a firm arm caught her around the waist, holding her steady.Her body ended up pressed closely against the man's broad,steady frame.

The scent on him was instantly familiar, and her heart started pounding.

Slowly,Kayla looked up,looking all nervous."Jeremy?"

Jeremy let go the moment she was stable, sliding both hands into his pockets. His voice was cold."North Investment isn't the place to charge in blindly."

Kayla flushed with embarrassment. "I'm sorry."

She saw the papers scattered on the floor and quickly crouched to pick them up.

Her blouse had a low neckline, and as she leaned forward, the edge of her black bra showed slightly,drawing attention to the shape of her figure. It was hard not to notice. Jeremy, standing right above her, caught the sight. His throat went dry, and he shifted slightly, heat creeping up his neck.

Edwin, who had entered behind him, was about to greet Kayla when Jeremy subtly blocked his view.

Kayla straightened up, noticing Jeremy's slightly red face.

She tilted her head, concerned. "Are you feeling alright?"

Jeremy didn't respond. He tugged at his tie and turned to the side, clearly flustered.

Only then did Kayla spot the words "CEO's Private Elevator" on the wall. No wonder everyone else had been waiting instead of entering-this one was off-limits.

She slapped her forehead lightly and muttered, "I should've checked before jumping in like that."

Jeremy shot her a glance but didn't say anything.

Edwin cleared his throat to break the tension. "Kayla,you're here for the contract,right? Mr. Newton already mentioned you'd be coming."
###Chapter 75 She Can Handle It
Kayla greeted Edwin with an easy smile and a nod."That's right. Today's the deadline for signing the project contract."

"Understood. Mr. Graham has a meeting shortly, so you'll need to wait for a bit," Edwin replied.

The elevator soon reached the top floor. Jeremy strode out ahead of the group.

As she followed, Kayla caught sight of Jeremy fidgeting with his tie, tugging at the knot as though he was overheating in the stale office air.

Once Jeremy ducked into his meeting, Edwin escorted Kayla to the reception lounge.

Minutes trickled by, stretching into almost two hours,until Kayla found herself slumping in her seat, eyelids heavy with exhaustion.
A secretary slipped in, balancing a tray of water as she eased the door open. Kayla blinked awake and sat up straighter. "Has Mr. Graham finished his meeting?"

The secretary-a soft-spoken young woman-offered a gentle smile and shook her head. "Not yet. He might be a while longer. If you're feeling tired, you could always take a quick nap here." Kayla stretched her arms above her head, stifling a yawn. "Don't worry about me. I'll browse my phone for a while."

The secretary's gaze landed on the untouched coffee sitting on the table. "Not a coffee person, are you?"

Kayla glanced at the cup and shrugged. "Not really."

The secretary let out a light laugh. "Funny enough, Mr.Graham isn't a fan either. We never even kept coffee around until Zoe started dropping by all the time.She loves it and insists we always have some ready."

Kayla lifted her glass and took a slow sip, then set it down with an easy smile. "So, does she swing by to see him a lot?"

The secretary's eyes lit up as she nodded. "She used to come nearly every day. Later on, Mr. Graham told her it wasn't really appropriate, so now she limits herself to once a week. But honestly, whenever she's here, she's quick to complain that we're not looking after Mr. Graham well enough."

The secretary's mildly irritated tone made it obvious she didn't think too highly of Zoe.

Suddenly intrigued by the glimpse into Jeremy's private affairs, Kayla leaned in and asked, "If she's that close to him, do they ever go out together?"

The secretary mulled it over, then replied earnestly," don't think so. Mr. Graham's always tied up with work. Whenever Zoe comes by, she usually leaves alone."

Kayla grinned and shot back. "So he really isn't interested in women? Is that just how he is?"

The door to the reception room flew open, and Jeremy strode in without a word of warning.

The secretary stiffened instantly, her entire demeanor switching to deference as she slipped out of the room without another sound.

Kayla summoned a strained smile, silently hoping Jeremy hadn't caught her last remark.

Jeremy entered with a quiet authority, every movement measured and composed. He settled into the seat across from her, his gaze keen and unyielding.

His eyes flicked up to meet hers, and his tone was icy."Is Archie keeping you so idle these days? You clearly have plenty of time to trade rumors about me."

Kayla straightened in her chair, her posture suddenly attentive. "Not at all. I was only making small talk.I trust you're far too understanding to let it bother you,aren't you?"

Jeremy let out a quiet, dismissive laugh. "You've got a real knack for wriggling out of trouble, don't you?"

Kayla pushed the carefully arranged contract across the table, her lips drawing up in a practiced, polite smile. "Please review the agreement. If everything meets your standards, we can move forward with the signing."

He drummed his fingers against the tabletop, his expression unyielding. "Frankly, I'm not confident about this project. Didn't Archie already express my reservations?"

Kayla replied without missing a beat, "I know you're hesitant because of the projected low returns. But I'm certain that putting money into this mall will pay off for North Investment. Newton Group is prioritizing mall development this year. Other projects may suffer, but this one is guaranteed to succeed."

A flicker of intrigue passed through Jeremy's eyes as he examined her. "Did Archie coach you on all this?"

Kayla pressed her lips into a faint smile, her confidence unwavering. "I'm hardly new to this business. If you have any doubts, you're welcome to Look into my track record."

Jeremy leaned back in his chair, a hint of skepticism in his gaze. "Not necessary. Word is, Perennia Group's entire rise is thanks to you."

Kayla passed him the pen, her crimson lips curving into a subtle, confident smile. "Then let's sign, shall we?"

For a brief instant, their eyes locked, tension simmering quietly between them.

A faint, amused laugh slipped from Jeremy as he reached over, took the pen from her fingers, and signed his name with a flourish at the bottom of the contract.

A quiet breath escaped Kayla, and she wasted no time rising from her seat to collect her belongings. "Looks like everything's in order. I appreciate your cooperation."

Jeremy's brows knit together, a trace of displeasure flickering across his face. Did she truly intend to walk out the moment she got what she wanted?

The secretary hurried in, her expression tense. "Mr.Graham,Mr. Campbell has arrived and is waiting in the conference room. But our pianist just called in sick-the musical performance might have to be canceled."

Irritation flickered across Jeremy's face. He leaned forward, voice cool and edged with frustration. "The piano performance was meant as a courtesy for Mr.Campbell. He expected it, and now you're telling me it's canceled?"

The secretary's shoulders tensed as she dipped her head."I'll do my best to find someone else right away."

Kayla slid the last folder into her bag, quietly preparing to slip out.

Before she could take another step, Jeremy's eyes Locked onto her. His voice, low and commanding,filled the room. "That won't be necessary. She can handle it."
###Chapter 76 | Need To Know Who The Woman Was
Kayla flinched slightly when she heard her name,blurting out without thinking, "I still need to go back to the company. I can't stay long."

Jeremy shot her a cold, sharp look. "I'll talk to Archie about this. I'm sure you can spare a few minutes."

She opened her mouth as if to argue but thought better of it and fell silent.

Jeremy then turned to his secretary and gave a small nod. "Set up the piano. Kayla will be playing."

In the conference room, Zane was already seated,being attended to by the secretary with polite conversation and refreshments.

When Jeremy and Kayla walked in together,Zane looked genuinely surprised. "What a coincidence Kayla,you're here too?"

Kayla gave him a polite nod and smiled, then instinctively walked over to the piano. A piece of sheet music had already been placed on the stand-it was one she recognized and could play without trouble.

She glanced over at Jeremy. "I only had a few piano lessons when I was younger. I'm not very skilled." Jeremy,now seated beside Zane, said calmly, "Just play."

Kayla nodded."Alright."

Zane smiled gently, his eyes full of expectation as he looked forward to hearing her play.

Jeremy had already asked the staff to leave the room.It was just the three of them now.

The soft piano notes slowly filled the room, wrapping the space in a quiet calm.

Zane reached for the folder in front of him, ready to discuss the contract, but when he glanced up, he paused. Jeremy wasn't even looking at the documents -his eyes were locked on Kayla, completely absorbed in her performance.

Zane looked between the two of them, a knowing smile playing at his lips, but he said nothing.

Kayla played three pieces in a row. As the final note faded, Jeremy finally turned his focus back to business, and the conversation with Zane began.

As the discussion went on, Kayla's phone, which was sitting on the table, started to vibrate.

She checked the caller ID, picked it up, and quietly walked out of the conference room to take the call.

"Is something wrong?" she asked, her tone dropping the moment she heard the caregiver's voice. The voice on the other end was filled with worry."Kayla, your grandmother ate breakfast this morning,but now she's saying her stomach hurts. You'd better come quickly."

"Alright, I'm on my way now." Kayla ended the call,turned back to the conference room, and paused when she saw Jeremy and Zane deep in discussion.She didn't want to interrupt.

At that moment, Edwin happened to walk by. She quickly approached him. "I have an emergency and need to go. Could you please let Jeremy know?"

Edwin took one look at her worried expression and gave a small nod. "Understood. Go ahead."

When Jeremy stepped out and found the room empty,a strange wave of emptiness crept over him.

Back in his office, he leaned back in his chair and lit a cigarette. The smoke curled upward as he sat in silence.

Edwin walked in moments later. "Mr. Graham, I've seen Mr. Campbell off. He agreed to let us handle next month's bidding project."

Jeremy responded with a quiet hum, but there was no enthusiasm behind it.

Edwin added, "Kayla had something urgent come up.She asked me to let you know."

leremy didn't reply right away. He tapped the ash from his cigarette into the tray, then finally spoke. "What about the investigation I assigned you?"

"We've asked the hotel for the full list of guests from that night. We're going through the records one by one. We'll find her eventually."

Jeremy's eyes narrowed. "No matter what it takes, I need to know who the woman in my room that night was."

Meanwhile, Kayla arrived at the care facility, rushing down the hallway. She opened the door to find Marsha lying peacefully in bed, already asleep.

To her surprise, Liam was seated beside the bed,gently adjusting the blanket. When he noticed Kayla enter, he stood and gave her a reassuring smile."Don't worry. Marsha's alright now."

Kayla frowned and asked in a cold voice, "What happened?"

"Let's talk outside," Liam said, leading her out of the room and quietly closing the door behind them. "I had the doctor take a look at her. They said she ate something that didn't sit well, but luckily, it wasn't too much. The doctor also mentioned that she needs more family around-her memory and awareness are starting to slip."

Kayla nodded once. "Got it. You can leave now."

But just as she turned to go back inside, Liam grabbed her hand and pulled her back against the wall. His tone softened,his eyes full of emotion. "Kayla, let's forget the past and start over. We can take Marsha home and take care of her together. She'd be so happy."

This time, Kayla didn't shove him away. But her eyes turned icy, and her voice was like steel. "Liam, what makes you think you have the right to say that to me?"
###Chapter 77 We're Already Done
Liam stood frozen, his hand tightening on Kayla's shoulder.

"I know l messed up," he said, desperation in his voice,eyes locked on hers. "But I've changed. I want to fix this. I swear, I'll never hurt you again."

"It's too late. We're already done." Kayla shoved him away,then brushed off the spot where he'd touched her,like wiping off something filthy. Her voice was cold and final. "We should go through with the divorce. The longer you drag this out, the worse it gets-for both of us."

Just then,the director walked over, his tone polite but firm. "Mr. and Mrs. Graham, I'd like to discuss something regarding Marsha. Could we talk in my office?"

Kayla didn't hesitate. "I can go alone."

But Liam, refusingto step back, quickly added, "I'm coming too. Marsha is like family to me."

Kayla turned and gave him a withering stare, her eyes full of contempt. She didn't say anything, but the look alone said enough.

Inside the office, the two of them sat stiffly beside each other as the director began to explain the situation.

Meanwhile, Liam's phone kept ringing nonstop, the sound getting on Kayla's nerves

She flung him an irritated glare and spat, "Either pick.up or switch it off before I lose my patience!"

Trying to stay composed, Liam stood and gave a polite nod. "Probably something urgent from work.I'll take it outside."

The director nodded in approval.

Once in the hallway, Liam glanced down at the screen.The number was all too familiar. His jaw tightened as he answered, voice low. "I already sent you the money.What else do you want?"

On the other end, a soft, sugary voice repled,"Liam,I love you so much. I don't want to leave you."

Liam clenched his jaw. "I've already made it clear-take the money and leave. Don't make me say it again."

Tricia's voice trembled through the line, full of tears and desperation.

But Liam didn't care anymore. His relationship with Tricia had been nothing more than a careless fling.Now that Kayla was divorcing him over it, he was determined to cut ties completely. If getting rid of Tricia meant even the smallest chance of winning Kayla back, then he'd do it."I've already booked my flight," Tricia said through choked sobs. "Can't you at least come see me off?Please,Liam."

Liam's face stayed cold. "We'll see. I'm busy."

He looked up just in time to see Kayla step out of the director's office. Without hesitation, he ended the call and walked over. "Is Marsha okay?"

Kayla glanced at him, her expression flat and cold."The director said she should be moved to a sunnier room. Getting sunlight every day will help her get better."

"I'll sort it out right away. I'll make sure she has the best room by tomorrow."

"There's no need," Kayla said coldly, brushing past him."I'll take care of it myself."

Liam followed close behind, clinging to her like a shadow she couldn't shake."It's alright. We're family -it shouldn't matter who handles it."

By the time Kayla got home, night had already fallen.Liam had driven her back and was still right behind her,stepping out of the car and trailing her as she made her way toward the building.
"Just pick a time to move back to the villa," he said."It's waiting for you-empty and quiet. It's your home."
Kayla came to a stop and turned around to face him head-on. "Liam, do you really think I don't see what you're doing? You're only crawling back because l've built a reputation at Newton Group. You want to use my connection with Archie to boost your company.Let me make this clear-you're wasting your time.I won't let you use me again."

Liam was stunned by her words. His face turned red.with embarrassment. "But I love you. How can you throw away everything we've been through?"

Kayla gave a cold, sharp laugh. "I already let go of everything the day you cheated on me with Tricia."

She didn't look back. She turned and walked off,leaving Liam frozen in place, powerless to stop her.

Liam stood there, frustrated and furious. With a clenched fist, he turned and slammed it down on the hood of his car. "Kayla, I won't give up!"

Back at home, Kayla stepped into the shower and only afterward remembered her bag-she hadn't left it in Liam's car but in the meeting room at North Investment.

While drying her hair in front of the mirror, she gently tapped her forehead. "I can't believe I forgot my bag Now I have to face Jeremy again tomorrow."

The doorbell rang.

Kayla quickly ran the towel through her hair once more and went to answer it.

At the door stood Jeremy's driver. 
"Ma'am, you left your bag at the office. Mr. Graham asked me to bring it to you," he said politely, handing it over.

Kayla accepted the bag and walked back inside. From her balcony, she looked down and saw a sleek black car parked below.

The back window lowered, and Jeremy looked up at her.

Their eyes met, and for a second, something wordless passed between them.

Kayla's heartbeat quickened, a flutter echoing in her chest. Something strange stirred inside her.

After a moment, Jeremy rolled the window up, and the car pulled away.

Kayla remained on the balcony, stiff, watching until the car was gone.

That night when she went to bed, she had a long and vivid dream.
###Chapter 78 A Dream About Jeremy
Kayla's dream felt so real it left her breathless. In it,Jeremy held her tightly from behind, pinning her to the bed. His lips brushed across her skin, warm and slow,drawing startled gasps from her.

When the sex was over, he cradled her against his chest. His large hands gripped her waist like he could snap her in two if he wanted.

He leaned close, voice low and charged. "You've got some nerve,lying to me all this time."

"Ah!"

Kayla bolted upright in bed with a cry, her eyes wide open. Sunlight streamed in through the window, and her chest rose and fell quickly as she tried to catch her breath.

She wiped the sweat from her forehead and let out a shaky breath. "Thank God it was just a dream."

But her body told a different story-her skin was slick with sweat, and there was a damp, sticky feeling between her legs.

She stared at the sheets in disbelief. She had actually dreamed about being that close to Jeremy. The memory burned through her with embarrassment.She climbed out of bed at once, heading straight for the shower. She scrubbed hard, trying to wash away the heat and shame before dressing in fresh clothes.

The night before, Archie had assigned her a new task.This morning, she was expected to attend a project presentation meeting at North Investment.

The situation couldn't have been more uncomfortable.After dreaming of such an intimate encounter with Jeremy, the idea of seeing him face-to-face made her hesitate to even step outside.

With a heavy heart, Kayla finally exited her apartment building-only to find Liam leaning against his car,clearly waiting for her.

He approached with a grin. "On your way to work? Let me drive you."

Kayla walked past him without saying a word.

Not giving up, Liam kept pace beside her. "Marsha's room is all set. She can move in today. If work's got you busy, I'll handle everything and make sure she's settled."

Kayla didn't answer. Instead, she pulled out her phone to call a cab.

Liam grabbed the phone before she could tap the screen and opened the car door for her. "Why bother with a cab when your husband's right here? Get in." Kayla didn't want to, but she was running late. With a huff, she slid into the seat.

Inside the car, Liam handed her a small bag."You probably haven't eaten yet. I got your favorite breakfast."

Kayla gave the bag a glance before pushing it away.
"No thanks."

When she realized they were heading toward Newton Group,she turned to him."I've got a meeting at North Investment today. Just drop me off there."

Liam's face darkened a little. He raised an eyebrow."You're going to meetings at North Investment now?"

His voice carried a trace of disbelief-like he couldn't quite imagine her being invited into the halls of North Investment.

Kayla met his puzzled look wwith a small, calm smile."Our company works closely with them. As part of Newton Group, it's only natural that I'm involved."

Liam said nothing for a moment. He knew how Perennia Group had been dragging its feet under his watch. Meanwhile, Kayla was moving between powerful firms, working with people like Archie and Jeremy.The difference stung.

Still, he forced a warm smile. "You're my wife. I'm happy to see you doing well. How about dinner tonight? Let's celebrate." Kayla looked out of the window. "Won't be possible.I'm busy."

When they arrived at North Investment, she got out without sparing him a second glance.

Even the security guards at the entrance greeted her with respect. Liam sat in the car, watching her walk inside until she disappeared from view.

He exhaled heavily and lit a cigarette, smoke swirling around his face.

Just then, his phone buzzed with a call from Janiya.As soon as he answered, she asked, "How are things with Kayla? Have you convinced her to drop the divorce?"

Liam was already in a foul mood, and Janiya's nagging only made it worse. "Mom, I've told you-stay out of this."

Janiya's voice turned sharp. "If I don't, Perennia Group will fall apart under you. Your grandfather is watching closely. He won't let you near Graham Group unless you prove you can handle Perennia. Jeremy won't help us-that's fine-but you need to secure Archie's help."

"Iknow," Liam said, impatience creeping into his voice.Suddenly,he caught sight of Zoe stepping out of a cab nearby.

His eyes followed her as she walked into North Investment.

Liam started the engine and pulled away, still on the phone. "Mom, when we brought Zoe over last time,did you notice Jeremy didn't seem all that thrilled?"

Janiya's voice turned wary.′′Are you saying Jeremy.doesn't like Zoe?"

Liam gave a faint smirk. "Maybe you should figure out what's really going on between them."
###Chapter 79 So Your Ultimate Goal Is To Divor...
Kayla got to the meeting room and discovered that Jeremy hadn't arrived yet. The meeting was postponed by half an hour.

She hadn't eaten that morning,so she decided to grab a quick meal at the canteen. On her way out, she accidentally bumped into someone entering.

Milk spilled to the floor, splashing onto the hem of Zoe's skirt. Zoe looked down, then shot Kayla a glare."Of course, it's you. Why do you keep turning up wherever I go? Like some kind of curse I can't shake."

Kayla stepped back, unbothered, and replied sharply,"You don't own this place. I can come and go as l please."

The quiet canteen suddenly felt charged. A few people nearby glanced over, sensing the tension.

Zoe stormed forward in her heels, towering over Kayla with her chin lifted in defiance. "Apologize. Right now.This is Jeremy's place, and if I say the word, security will drag you out." Kayla couldn't help but laugh. She raised her hand to her lips, her voice laced with amusement. "Oh really?Then why didn't he say a word for you at the club that night?" Zoe's face turned beet red. "Stop trying to come between me and Jeremy! People like you shouldn't even be allowed in here. Leave!"

Before Kayla could say anything,Jeremy's secretary appeared at the entrance, scanning the room. After a moment, the secretary walked over to both of them.

Thinking the secretary had come for her, Zoe gave a smug smile and flicked her hand with confidence."Told you-he clearly sent someone to get me. You'd better apologize while you still have the chance."

Kayla said nothing, but a faint smile played on her lips.

Zoe stood there,waiting proudly to be acknowledged -only for the secretary to walk right past her and stop in front of Kayla.

"Ma'am, the meeting's about to begin. Mr. Graham has requested your presence," the secretary said.

Kayla nodded calmly. "Alright. I will join them now."

Zoe's jaw dropped in shock. She stepped forward in a rush, eyes wide. "Wait-Jeremy's here? Take me to see him."

The secretary paused, then replied politely, "I'm sorry,Ms. Cooper, but Mr. Graham's tied up at the moment.He asked me to let you know it's best if you leave for now."

Zoe's expression soured. She pointed at Kayla and barked, "Then why is she allowed to see him?" "She's here on behalf of Newton Group. She's scheduled to attend the meeting."

Kayla lifted her work badge with a bright smile. "You heard that, huh? I'm here on business, not to cause a scene."

Zoe's anger surged, her face flushed with frustration.

Kayla brushed past her, lightly bumping shoulders,and walked away alongside the secretary.

Zoe stood frozen in place, seething. She stomped her heel on the floor and muttered through clenched teeth, "Just wait. I'll prove how important I am to Jeremy."

Inside the meeting room, Kayla gave a confident, well -prepared presentation. Her clear explanations and polished delivery earned her a round of applause from the executives around the table.

At the head of the table sat Jeremy, flpping through her proposal with a cold, sharp look on his face. He didn't find a single flaw.

When the meeting ended, Kayla made her way over to him and asked without hesitation, "Jeremy, do you have any feedback?"

Jeremy looked up, his dark eyes locking onto hers.

Something about his stare made Kayla uneasy. She quickened her steps, stopping just in front of him. "Did I miss something?" Jeremy shut the proposal folder and let it fall onto the table with a casual flick of his hand. Then he crossed one leg over the other and looked at her steadily."What made you decide to work with Newton Group?"

The question caught Kayla off guard.

She hesitated for a moment before answering honestly, "They still have control over my mother's company. If I want it back, I have to help Mr. Newton win a few big deals. That's what we agreed on from the beginning."

Jeremy studied her. "So your ultimate goal is to divorce Liam?"

She gave a firm nod."Yes."

He nodded slightly, then stood up, hands in his pockets, and began walking to the door.

Not sure whether he was pleased with her work,Kayla hurried after him. "About Newton Group's other project proposals-can I get your go-ahead?"

Suddenly, Jeremy stopped. Caught off guard, Kayla bumped into him from behind and stumbled forward.

He turned and caught her just in time. They fell back slightly against the edge of the conference table.

Held in his arms, Kayla looked up at him, her cheeks flushed. She quickly looked away, unable to look into his eyes.

Jeremy's voice came low and cold from above her."You're responsible for the projects. Handle them well, and we won't have any issues."

He'd given his approval.
Kayla's face lit up. She was about to thank him when a knock sounded at the door of the conference room.

Before anybody could say a word, Zoe barged in."Jeremy, I'm coming in!"
###Chapter 80 | Won't Let Them Find Out
Jeremy acted fast. He pulled Kayla into his arms and turned his back to the doorway, shielding her completely from view.

He held her close, pressing her firmly to his chest. She could feel his heartbeat-strong and steady,pounding right beneath her ear.

Kayla didn't dare breathe too loudly. Her heart thudded in her chest as she stood frozen in his embrace.

If anyone saw them like this, rumors would spread like wildfire.

Zoe walked in, only to be met with the shocking sight of Jeremy holding another woman. Her eyes widened,and the tray in her hands slipped from her grasp,crashing loudly to the floor. She slapped a hand over her mouth, completely stunned. "What is going on here?"

Jeremy didn't move or even glance her way. His voice was icy. "Get out."

Zoe stood there, stunned. Her emotions spiraled out of control as anger took over. It felt like a punch to the gut-like betrayal from someone she trusted deeply. She pointed at him, shouting, "What are you doing with her? Is this how you repay me?"

Her words grated on Jeremy's nerves. His expression tightened, his voice turning even colder. "Get out."

Zoe's rage boiled over intowounded pride. "Who even is this woman?"

Jeremy didn't flinch. "This is the last time I'll tell you.Get out."

Zoe's anger gave way to pain and humiliation, and tears filled her eyes. She turned and ran out of the room, covering her face with her hand as sobs escaped her.

As soon as the door closed behind her, Kayla stepped back quickly, freeing herself from Jeremy's arms. Her face was flushed with embarrassment, and she avoided his gaze. "Sorry."

Jeremy dropped his hands calmly, as if nothing had happened. "No need to apologize. There's nothing going on between us."

StilI flustered, Kayla nodded quickly and brushed past him,lowering her head. "I should get going."

The room was now quiet with Jeremy standing there alone. He tugged at his tie, his face expressionless,but the heat rising in his chest gave him away.

Whenever he was near Kayla, a strange kind of tension 1ould huild inside him-an uneasy energy that pressed against the surface, desperate to escape.

He had always taken pride in keeping his emotions in check,but around her, that control slipped away as if it had never existed.

Just then, Edwin stepped inside. "Mr. Graham, Zoe just ran out of the building in tears. She's outside right now and looks very upset. Should I check on her?"

Jeremy rubbed his temple with a sigh. His tone was cool, without any sign of emotion. "Take her home.Give her whatever she wants."

Edwin gave a quick nod and left.

Zoe,despite her heartbreak, didn't hesitate to accept the benefits Jeremy provided. Deep down,she believed that no matter who else he grew close to,he owed her something-and she wasn't going to let go of that.

In the car, she tried coaxing information out of Edwin -anything about the woman she had seen in Jeremy's arms-but he kept his mouth shut. She couldn't get a single detail out of him.

Later that day, Zoe arrived at the most luxurious hot spring hotel, where she had arranged a spa day with her closest friends.

After spending time in the steaming pools, she emerged glowing, surrounded by friends who fawned over her. "You're so lucky, Zoe. A rich, powerful boyfriend like Jeremy? And you even brought us along? This place is ridiculously expensive!"

Zoe, feeling smug, smiled proudly. "I believe in sharing the good life. Some people used to spread rumors that my relationship with Jeremy wasn't real, but l guess I'm proving them wrong now."

Her friends exchanged knowing glances, offering smiles filled with flattery. "Those people were clearly just jealous.Jeremy obviously cares for you."

"Of course he does. But I never forget the people who've been with me along the way." Zoe walked confidently up to the front desk, pulled out a gold card from her purse, and handed it over. "Charge everything to this."

Her friends gasped.

A gold card-something few people in Trark had ever even seen. It was only given to the city's elite, and Jeremy had personally given it to Zoe.

That evening, Zoe brimmed with pride, pleased with the attention. As the bill was taken care of, Zoe stepped over to a lounge chair to fix her lipstick.

But nearby, the hotel manager and his assistant sat talking in hushed voices. "The higher-ups just issued a directive," the assistant said. "We need to look into every guest who stayed on the 33rd floor last month.With how full we are, it's going to be a huge task." Zoe's hand shook, smearing her lipstick. She snatched up a tissue, pretending to fix it while listening closely.

The manager replied, "We don't have a choice. Orders are orders. We're supposed to find out who that woman was-the one who mistakenly entered the presidential suite that night. Surveillance footage is gone,so we'll have to go through digital records."

"Who would dare walk into Mr. Graham's room like that?" the assistant muttered.

The manager stood up with a clap. "No more chatting.Let's get started. They want results in two day/s."

The two men walked off, one after the other.

Zoe sat frozen, her face losing color. Panic spread through her body like ice water.

Jeremy was investigating that night again. If he found out the truth-that she wasn't the woman who entered his suite-everything she had worked so hard for would fall apart.

Gripping her lipstick until her knuckles turned white,Zoe whispered under her breath,"No. I won't let them find out."
###Chapter 81 Kayla Is Molested
Kayla returned to Newton Group to deliver her report,and Archie couldn't hide his admiration for how swiftly she had handled the task.

Seated behind his desk, he flipped through the project contracts she submitted, each one signed by Jeremy.

With a satisfied nod, he said, "Kayla, I knew I made the right call. These deals have always been tough to lock in,yet you pulled it off like it was nothing. At this rate,I'll need to give you a bigger role. Otherwise, we're wasting your potential."

Kayla offered a humble smile. "That's kind of you, Mr.Newton. I'm just doing my part."

Archie let out a small laugh. "We're holding a celebratory dinner tonight with the project heads.You're on the guest list, of course. Also, expect a salary bump this month, along with everything else l promised."

Kayla suddenly recalled that Marsha was switching rooms tonight, and she had planned to help. Her expression tightened, atrace of concern flickering across her face.

Archie caught the shift in her demeanor. "Something the matter? You already made plans for tonight? You're the reason we're celebrating, and this dinner is meant to honor that."

Given his insistence, Kayla could only agree. "Okay.I'll be there."

Once she left the CEO's office, she pulled out her phone and stepped aside to make a call.

The caregiver picked up. "Kayla, is there something you need?"

"I have work tonight, so I won't be able to stay with Grandma. Please keep a close eye on her."

The caregiver's voice was calm. "Don't worry.Your husband already arranged for someone to help with the move. Since you've got your hands full, there's no need to come."

Hearing Liam's name made Kayla tense. If she hadn't been swamped with work, he wouldn't have had a chance to meddle at all.

The dinner was attended by Archie and several seasoned project leaders.

Just outside the private dining room, Kayla paused when she saw a waiter wheeling in a cart loaded with bottles of red wine.

Archie spotted her and called out, "Kayla, step inside."

As she stepped inside, several executives looked up,momentarily taken aback by her striking appearance.Isaac Brewer,one of the senior figures, smiled with a subtle squint and remarked to Archie, "I was starting to wonder how you've been closing so many deals lately.Now I see it's all thanks to this impressive young woman. You're sitting on a goldmine of talent."

Kayla returned a soft smile and took a seat beside Archie.

Chuckling,Archie replied, "Kayla's been a real asset.We're fortunate she chose to work with us."

Then hè leaned slightly toward her and murmured,"These folks have been with me a long time. No need to stay too long; just make an appearance, then you can head out."

Kayla nodded lightly. "Got it."

Across the table, Jorge Quinn lifted his glass and stood up. "Kayla, I've heard quite a bit about your accomplishments. Let me toast to your success."

Kayla poured herself a glass of juice, stood up, and responded warmly, "I'll toast with this instead. Mr.Quinn, I look forward to learning from you."

Isaac cut in, "Jorge is making a toast and you're drinking juice? Come on, everyone here has wine."

Before the moment grew tense, Archie rose with his own glass and laughed. "I'll take the wine for her.Hope that's alright with everyone."

Jorge and lsaac shared a qlance but couldn't refuse Archie's gesture. They raised their glasses, clinked them together, and drank as one.

Partway through the evening, Archie's phone rang. He excused himself and stepped out to take the call.

Left at the table, Kayla remained quiet. The conversation didn't interest her, so she checked her phone,scrolling through unread messages.

Isaac soon approached, wineglass in hand, and took the seat beside her. "I've heard your name more than once. Archie holds you in high regard, and now that I've met you in person, I can see why."

Kayla slipped her phone into her bag and returned a polite smile. "You flatter me, Mr. Brewer. I'm just doing my job."

His expression sharpened with amusement as he rested an arm along the back of her chair and leaned in, legs casually crossed. The space between them grew noticeably smaller.

He brushed her hand under the pretense of adjusting his glass,his tone suggestive. "Drinking juice all night,that's no fun."

Kayla's instincts kicked in. Her expression cooled as she pulled her hand away and discreetly wiped it on her skirt. Without a word, she reached for the wine bottle and filled a glass. "Mr. Brewer, since we've run into each other tonight,allow me to offer you a toast."
###Chapter 82 I'll Take This One For Her
Isaac leaned in closer, his arm draped casually along the back of Kayla's chair, his grin widening with mischief. "One glass? That's hardly enough. You should at least have three glasses."

Kayla lifted her glass with a playful raise of her brow."Sure. I'll drink as much as you do."

Isaac tapped his glass against hers and tossed the entire drink back in one go.

While his head tilted back, Kayla quietly tipped her glass beneath the table, letting the liquid spill onto the floor without a trace. When he looked back at her, she flashed a bright smile and held up her now-empty glass."Finished."

lsaac, completely fooled, lit up with enthusiasm. "Then let's keep it going!"

Using the same trick, Kayla pretended to down a few more drinks. Meanwhile, the liquor began taking its toll on Isaac. His cheeks flushed, and his words grew looser as the alcohol crept through him.

Kayla's lips curled into a subtle smirk. It was time for her to get going. "Mr. Brewer, if you'll excuse me,l need to visit the ladies' room." She had barely started to rise when lsaac grabbed her arm and pulled her back into the seat.

His hand landed right where she was still sore, and she flinched at the sudden jab of pain. "Not so fast," he slurred. "You're not going anywhere until you finish this."

He, clearly tipsy, poured another glass, filling it to the brim, and slid it in front of her, eyes fixed on her every move.

Kayla gàve him a sly smile. "It's no fun if I'm the only one drinking. Join me, won't you?"

Isaac wobbled his head, waving a finger at her face."| don't believe you can handle this much alcohol without getting drunk. This one's all yours. Bottoms up."

That sneaky bastard! Kayla cursed inwardly.

The others at the table had started paying attention and joined in with laughter and taunts. "Come on,Kayla! Don't let us down. Mr. Newton isn't here, so it's on you to hold his ground!"

Kayla leaned back slightly, putting on a look of casual confidence."Who said I wouldn't drink? It's just a bit of wine."

She picked up the glass and brought it to her lips. But just as it reached her mouth, her hand twitched-"accidentally"-and the entire contents spilled onto Isaac's lap. The deep red liquid soaked through his trousers, leaving a very obvious stain.

Right at that moment, Jeremy walked past the doorway of the private room. He stopped, his gaze landing sharply on the scene inside.

Behind him, Edwin remarked, "I heard Mr. Newton was hosting a banquet tonight. Didn't expect Kayla to be in attendance too. Mr. Graham, should we go say hello?"

Jeremy didn't answer right away. He stood still, eyes narrowed,watching the room with quiet intensity.

Inside, Isaac jumped to his feet, flustered and clearly humiliated. He tried shaking the wine from his clothes,but the stain only spread further. The red mark on his lap was impossible to ignore. "What the hell's wrong with you?" he snapped. "You can't even hold a drink right?"

Kayla shot up from her seat, her expression a picture of panic. She snatched a stack of napkins from the table and rushed to lsaac's side, her voice shaky and full of regret. "I'm so sorry, Mr. Brewer! That was completely my fault. I didn't mean to. Please don't be upset."

Jorge jumped in with a sneer. "You need to be more careful. Look at his trousers-they're a mess. You think just saying sorry is enough to fix that?"

Kayla blinked rapidly, her eyes glistening like she was on the verge of tears. Her face crumpled into a look so pitiful that it made her seem like she might fall apart any second. She looked very sorry. Isaac and Jorge exchanged uncertain glances. The fight in them fizzled-neither wanted to be seen ganging up on a woman who looked that devastated.

Isaac finally let out a heavy sigh and waved her off,reaching for a cloth to drape over the stain. "Forget it.I'll go change."

As he stepped out of the room, the corners of Kayla's mouth curved into a quiet, victorious smile-hidden just well enough.

What she didn't know was that Jeremy had seen the whole thing. Leaning just outside the room, his eyes following her every move. There was a faint smirk on his face. She really knew how to play her cards.

At that moment, Archie returned from taking a call and noticed Jeremy nearby. He looked surprised."Jeremy! If you're free, why don't you come in and have a drink with us?"

Jeremy glanced at him briefly, then stepped into the room without saying a word.

The moment Kayla saw him walk in, her smile vanished.Her eyes dropped to the floor to avoid making eye contact with him.

Jeremy didn't miss a beat. As he passed her, his eyes landed on her for a split second.

Kayla's heart pounded in her chest. She'd been a breath away from slipping out unnoticed. Of all times,why did he have to walk in now?

Archie clapped his hands. "Well then! Since Jeremy is here, let's all raise a glass and give a proper toast!"

Immediately, Isaac and Jorge straightened up like schoolboys caught misbehaving. Gone was the earlier bravado-they nodded quickly, all too eager to show respect.

Kayla scoffed to herself. What a bunch of spineless old bullies!

As the glasses were lifted, Jeremy's smooth, deep voice cut through the air, directed at her with a subtle edge. "Kayla, won't you be joining us?"

Kayla reached for the bottle of juice beside her,intending to pour herself a drink quietly. But Jeremy's voice came again-subtle enough to sting. "What's the matter? No more wine? Or has Archie run out of money?"

The jab was clear. This wasn't juice hour-he expected real wine.

Kayla's mind went into overdrive. Her little tricks wouldn't fly here. Jeremy wasn't the type to be fooled by a spilled drink or a staged accident.

Before she could say anything, Archie jumped in,trying to ease the tension. "I'll take this one for her."

But Jeremy didn't even look his way. His eyes stayed locked on Kayla. "Her drink should be taken by herself."
###Chapter 83 Help Her Out

Jeremy's intense stare bore into her as Kayla, hands unsteady, reached for the wine bottle and began to pour.

But she was still pregnant. Drinking now could put everything at risk.

She drew in a slow breath, her grip shifting to the wine glass.

Before she could lift it to her lips, Jeremy spoke up."Relax. I was only kidding. Drinking is a men's game anyway."

At that, the group lifted their glasses, exchanged toasts, and drank in one smooth motion.

Relieved, Kayla quietly set her untouched wine glass aside and reached for her juice instead.

As the others carried on their conversation, she politely excused herself and stepped out of the private roomn. Just as she left, her phone buzzed-it was Liam calling.

"Are you done yet? When are y/ou getting here?" His impatience was obvious.

Kayla checked the time, her tone calm but distant. "I'm having dinner with clients tonight. Probably won't make it. Let my grandma sleep early-I'll visit her another day."

Liam's voice snapped like a whip. "Clients? Do you even know what kind of people they are? And you're okay with that?"

Resting her back against the hallway wall, Kayla closed her eyes and rubbed her temples, the fatigue creeping in. "This is work-related. And it doesn't concern you.Stop acting like you still have a say."

"Work? Don't make me laugh. You're just using your body to climb the ladder. Bet you love the way those men stare at you!" Liam lost his temper. The image of her surrounded by men sent his anger soaring, the jealousy eating away at him.

Kayla didn't flinch. "Your mind is twisted."

Liam's teeth clenched as he snapped, "You really think I'll believe there aren't any men with you?"

Too tired to argue, she barked, "Believe whatever helps you sleep. If you're so disgusted, then divorce me.I'm done wasting time."

Without waiting for a reply, she ended the call and powered off her phone, shutting him out completely.

The breeze outside the restroom hit her like a breath of sanity. She leaned against the glass, letting the cool air steady her nerves.

Meanwhile, Jeremy lingered just long enough to exchange a few final words with the group, then slipped out. Another round of waiting awaited him in the private suite next door.

As he passed the men's room, voices from inside caught his ear.

"Mr. Brewer, what led to all this trouble tonight?"Isaac's assistant lifted the stained trousers, his voice carrying a note of worry.

In front of the mirror, Isaac-well into his fifties, with a bloated face and sagging posture-fumbled with his trousers. Though the liquor still lingered in his system,the fog had started to lift.

"It's that woman next to Archie. She forced a drink on me-then dumped it all over me like it was nothing."

The assistant paused, then said cautiously, "I saw a waiter clean up a spill near her seat. Maybe she never drank at all."

"What?" Isaac's face twisted, uglier than before. Fury lit up his eyes. "She played me? That little bitch!She must pay for it. Make sure she's in my room tonight."

The assistant glanced around, voice dropping to a whisper. "But Mr. Newton seems pretty protective. If we go through with this, we might step on the wrong toes."

Isaac scoffed, brushing off the warning, "You think Archie gives a damn about some nobody? She's nothing serious. He won't risk the deal over her." The assistant gave a nod, tone shifting to quiet obedience. "Got it, Mr. Brewer. I'll make it happen."

Upon hearing that, Jeremy turned and walked off without a word, his face giving nothing away.

Back at the table, Kayla kept up appearances,smiling through conversations until she found a moment to excuse herself.

At the elevator, she waited quietly. The doors opened,and there stood Jeremy.

Kayla's heart skipped. Without hesitation, she spun around and stepped into the next elevator over. Of all nights, she had to run into him. The idea of being stuck in a space with Jeremy was the last thing she wanted.

Even Edwin blinked in surprise. "She rushed off like she couldn't stand being near us."

Catching himself,he glanced sideways at Jeremy, who now stood still, his face blank, a shadow settling over his face. Edwin knew better than to say more.

Jeremy raised his face just slightly as he pressedthe button to close the elevator.

But fate wasn't done with them yet. As they stepped out of the hotel, Kayla and Jeremy found themselves arriving at the entrance at the exact same moment.

"Kayla, care to ride with us?" Edwin asked, polite as ever. Kayla shook her head, gesturing toward a waiting cab."No need. I'll take that one. Wouldn't want to trouble you both."

Jeremy's dark eyes met hers,cold and steady.′′Aryou sure you don't want to come with me?"

The question, pointed and direct, only cemented her choice. She stood firm. "I'm sure. Go ahead."

Jeremy gave a soft, bitter laugh and slid into the car without another word.

Kayla watched as his car disappeared into the traffic,then walked toward the taxi. Though she hadn't had a sip, the stench of alcohol clung to her skin. All she wanted was a hot shower and clean clothes.

Meanwhile, Jeremy's black car glided down the road,the city lights flickering past. Resting his head against the glass, he shut his eyes, the words from the restroom conversation looping through his thoughts.

From the front, Edwin checked the rearview mirror and spoke carefully. "Mr. Graham, the taxi she took is heading somewhere that's not her place."
Kayla shook her head, gesturing toward a waiting cab."No need. I'll take that one. Wouldn't want to trouble you both."

Jeremy's dark eyes met hers,cold and steady.′′Aryou sure you don't want to come with me?"

From the front, Edwin checked the rearview mirror and spoke carefully. "Mr. Graham, the taxi she took is heading somewhere that's not her place."
###Chapter 84 Find Her

It took some time before Kayla noticed the taxi was straying farther and farther from familiar streets, the scenery growing more desolate by the minute. She shot a worried look at the driver and asked,"This isn't the way home. Did you get lost?"

The driver gave no reply, eyes locked on the road as his foot pressed down, picking up speed.

A chill crept up Kayla's spine. Sensing danger, she slapped her palm against the back of the seat and shouted, "Pull over! Let me out, right now!"

Ignoring her protests, the driver slammed the pedal down and veered onto a rugged, uneven path.

Thrown side to side by the rough ride, Kayla fumbled desperately for her phone, intent on calling for help.

Before her fingers could dial a single number, the car screeched to a halt. The back door flew open, and two strangers yanked her from the seat.

A hood slipped over her head, plunging everything into darkness. "Who are you? Let me go!" she screamed,voice raw with terror.

Her cries were ignored as the men stuffed her into a different vehicle and sped away.

Bound and helpless in the back seat, Kayla struggled and screamed, but her efforts were swallowed by silence. Eventually, the car ground to a stop.

She was dragged out, half-carried, and brought to the entrance of a rundown motel. They paused outside a battered door.

"Move!" one of them shouted, untying her just long enough to shove her roughly inside.

Kayla stumbled, barely catching herself against the peeling wallpaper.

In the next instant, the hood was yanked away,and harsh light stabbed her eyes. She squinted, shielding her eyes from the glare.

A slimy voice slithered out of the shadows. "Well,well, look who it is. Missed me,sweetheart?"

Revulsion twisted Kayla's stomach as she turned and spotted Isaac. His bloated frame and leering,greasy face made her skin crawl.

A wave of nausea rolled over her, forcing her to steady herself against the wall as she fought to keep from retching

Seeing her in that state only seemed to darken Isaac's mood. He grabbed her roughly by the collar, his words seething with anger. "You bitch! How dare you get me drunk tonight? You'll pay for this, I promise!"

Reacting fast, Kayla slammed her heel onto his foot and jerked away. "Back off! Don't you dare lay a finger on me!"

A twisted glint shone in Isaac's eyes as he sized her up,openly leering at her face and the lines of her figure.He licked his lips and took another step forward."Here's the deal. If you satisfy me tonight, maybe I'll let the past slide. What do you say?"

Kayla continued to retreat, inching behind the couch as a barrier. She spat her contempt at him. "If you're so desperate, why not buy yourself a prostitute? You act like a respected CEO, but you're nothing but filth."

Her insults only seemed to fuel lsaac's sick excitement. "Say what you like now. Soon you'lI be begging me to stop. We'll see how defiant you are then."

He wiped his mouth, eyes locked on her as he moved closer. Kayla snatched up a sofa cushion and flung it in his face.

As Isaac lunged,she raced for the window, throwing it wide open. The night wind tore through the room,tossing loose papers into the air.

Leaning halfway out, Kayla fixed him with a steely glare. "One more step and I'll jump. Don't test me!"

Isaac let out a mocking laugh. "Go ahead. It's your choice."

Kayla's voice turned cold. "You sure about that? The room's in your name. The police will find out everything. Imagine the scandal-'Brewer Group CEO Drives Woman to Suicide.' How do you think that'll play in the news?"

His expression faltered, panic flickering across his features. Narrowing his gaze, he trieda new tactic."Come over here. Spend the night, and I'll make you rich-more than a hundred times what Newton Group pays you. You could live like royalty."

A sharp laugh escaped Kayla. "Keep your money. Not everything's for sale. If you know what's good for you,you'll let me walk out of here now."

Isaac's temper snapped. He whipped out his phone,barking orders for his men to come in.

Seeing her chance, Kayla bolted for the exit. The fool hadn't bothered to lock the door, and she slipped out without looking back.

Isaac's furious voice echoed behind her. "Don't let her get away!"

Sprinting down the corridor, Kayla made it to the elevator-only to find herself face-to-face with Isaac's men. For a split second, everyone froze,uncertain.

Recovering quickly, Kayla pointed frantically down the hall. "Isaac's about to jump out the window! Hurry!"

The men's heads whipped in the direction she'd indicated.Before they could process her words, she was already gone. Realizing they'd been duped, the head of the group snapped, "She's got to be close! Find her, now!"

Kayla darted past the stairwell, heart pounding. Out of nowhere, a hand shot out and seized her, yanking her into the dark.
###Chapter 85 Feeling Satisfied Now
 A sudden, familiar scent washed over Kayla and she found herself swept into a comforting embrace.

Jeremy's lips nearly brushed her ear as he murmured,"Stay quiet."

Without protest, Kayla nodded, heart thundering in her chest. With heavy footsteps drawing nearer, she instinctively gripped his jacket.

Jeremy shifted, turning her slightly toward the stairwell door. His arms held her close, bodies pressed together as if they were lost in each other,protecting her from view.

Their pursuers rounded the corner and slowed,surprised by the sight. "These two can't even wait for a room."

A gentle squeeze at her waist made Kayla let out a breathy gasp, the sound just suggestive enough to convince the onlookers.

Their laughter echoed in the stairwell, and one man swiped a hand across his mouth. "Look at them-can't keep their hands off each other."

With a few more lingering glances, the group finally turned away and disappeared around the corner.Relief washed over Kayla as the tension melted from her limbs, and she allowed herself to rest in Jeremy's steady embrace. For the first time that night, comfort replaced her fear.

She tipped her head back and searched his face."Why are you here?"

Unruffled, Jeremy answered, "Let's worry about you first."

Nerves had Kayla gnawing at her lip. "I never imagined Isaac wòuld go this far. And how did you know?"

A flicker of emotion crossed Jeremy's face,but he didn't answer. Instead, he broke eye contact and strode toward the stairs.

Not wanting to be left alone, Kayla hurried after him,matching his pace.

They descended the steps together until Edwin appeared at the landing, alert and ready. "Should I bring the car around,Mr.Graham?"

Jeremy studied Kayla from the corner of his eye.Something about her expression suggested she was far from finished with the night's drama.

Without warning, Kayla looked up, her voice sharp."We're just going to let that creep walk? That doesn't sit right with me."

A single eyebrow lifted on Jeremy's face, his calm unshaken. "What's running through your mind?" 
A sly grin crept onto Kayla's lips. "Please, wait in the car for me. I've got something to handle, and it won't take long."

With her plan in mind, she slipped off in the direction of the staff break room.

Edwin frowned, clearly baffled. "She just escaped a setup and now she's going back in? What's her game?"

A small, knowing smile appeared on Jeremy's face."Kayla's not the type to let things slide. If someone tries to harm her, she makes sure they regret it."

Still unsure, Edwin grumbled, "Is she really going to take on all that by herself? Should I help her?"

Jeremy offered no reply, simply heading for the exit without another glance.

Left in limbo, Edwin stood there muttering,"So...am I going or staying?"

Inside his suite, Isaac was losing his mind after Kayla's escape. He'd reduced the room to chaos, overturning furniture and smashing everything in sight.

Fury crackled in his voice as he jabbed a finger at his men. "What good are you? Couldn't even handle a single woman! Why do I even keep you around?"

Eyes glued to the floor, the men stayed silent. One finally stammered, "We checked every corner-she's vanished. Must've slipped out somehow." The response only made lsaac's temper explode further. With a vicious kick, he sent the man stumbling."Useless!"

Left with no other choice, Isaac picked up the phone and called housekeeping to handle the mess he'd made.

A hotel worker appeared in the doorway, uniform baggy and hat pulled so low it shadowed the eyes,a mask hiding nearly every feature.

He jerked a thumb over his shoulder without even looking. "Not a single spot, understand?"

Kayla gave a silent nod, blending in as she mimed scrubbing and sweeping around the wvreckage.

While she busied herself, Isaac's foul mood spilled out in a phone call. "Had a run-in with some stubborn woman tonight-ruined everything. Send a few women up. I need to blow off steam."

Oblivious to Kayla's true identity, he stripped down right there, tossed his clothes aside, and strode into the shower.

Kayla's gaze sharpened with mischief. She tossed her broom, snatched up every last bit of his clothing,shoes, and accessories, then hauled everything out to the hallway and dumped it in the nearest cleaning cart. Making sure not toleave a trace, she wheeled the cart away and vanished from sight.

Minutes later, Isaac emerged from the bathroom, only to stop dead. Not a stitch of his wardrobe remained.He hadn't even begun to process his humiliation when his phone rang shrilly.

"Isaac! You'd better get down here this instant!"

The unmistakable voice of his wife cut through his bravado. At home, he never dared cross her-his tough act only surfaced when she was nowhere to be seen.

He fumbled for an excuse. "Honey, I'm just... handling business. I'll be home soon, I swear."

She snapped back with cold authority, "Don't feed me that line. I'm at your hotel door, and if you make me wait,you're done for, you cheating rat!"

Panic seized him. In nothing but his underwear,Isaac bolted from the suite and made a desperate dash for the stairs.

One of his men caught a glimpse of the spectacle."Mr.Brewer, where are you headed like that?"

Isaac tore through the hallway, flailing in a panic and yelling, "She's coming! Run!" From behind a column, Kayla emerged with a smirk,casually let the broom clatter to the floor, and brushed her palms clean like the whole mess had never involved her.

She strolled toward the elevator and nearly collided with none other than lsaac's wife herself. Putting on her most helpful expression, she gestured down the corridor. "Ma'am, I think I saw Mr. Brewer sprint that way."

Isaac's wife cracked her knuckles with deadly calm."That man's about to meet his end."

A few seconds later, Isaac's shrieks bounced off the stairwell walls-each scream more pitiful than the last as chaos erupted.

Kayla didn't bother to look back. She stepped out into the night air and slid effortlessly into the sleek black car parked by the curb.

Inside,Jeremy lounged with one leg crossed,flipping through a glossy magazine like he hadn't a care in the world. As soon as the door shut,he folded it neatly and glanced over with a crooked grin. "Feeling satisfied now?"
###Chapter 86 How Do You Plan To Thank Me
Kayla stifled a smile, adopting a serious expression as she looked at Jeremy. "I really have to thank you for tonight. Without your help, I wouldn't have gotten out so quickly."

Jeremy suddenly felt like teasing her and asked, "And how do you plan to thank me?"

"Huh?" Kayla blinked, caught off guard. She had only meant to be polite. Was he actually expecting something in return?

Glancing at the night beyond the car window, Jeremy offered casually, "If you're serious, you could play the piano for me."

Kayla noticed the glimmer of amusement in his eyes and realized he genuinely enjoyed hearing her play the piano. It wasn't a demanding request. She could easily do it.

Their car pulled up in front of a music-themed restaurant. Though it should have been closed at this hour,the manager had rushed back to reopen it the moment he heard Jeremy was coming.

Inside, Jeremy made himself comfortable at a table while the staff brought out a variety of light dishes. It was only then Kayla realized that Jeremy hadn't eaten all night. It seemed the stop was less spontaneous than she thought. He wanted a quiet meal accompanied by her music.

Jeremy motioned towvard the piano. "You can start."

Kayla walked over, tested the keys with a few light touches, then began to play with ease born of long practice.

Jeremy dined gracefully,occasionally glancing up from his plate to watch her. In her movements, he often caught flashes of his mother's elegance.

Time slipped by. Kayla lost count of how many pieces she played. However,Jeremy never asked her to stop.

Eventually, when she turned to check on him,she found him leaning back, eyes closed, fast asleep.

Soft lighting cast a golden hue over him, making it look as if he were cloaked in sunlight. He looked dignified and serene-almost untouchable in his stillness.

Kayla stared for a moment, mesmerized. Without realizing it, she stepped closer and sat beside him. His features were sharp and refined, like a sculpture carved by God.

Noticing a long eyelash resting on his cheek, she reached out instinctively to brush it away. But just as her fingers touched his skin, his eyes snapped open and his hand shot up, seizing her wrist in a tight grip.

Kayla winced slightly, her brows furrowing from the sudden pressure.

When Jeremy saw it was her, he immediately let go,his voice low. "Were you trying to pull something while I was asleep?"

Kayla gave an awkward smile. "No. I just saw something on your face and wanted to brush it off."

His gaze lingered on her a moment longer, unreadable.Then, nodding toward the piano, he said, "You played well tonight. You can leave."

"Alright." Kayla didn't argue. Grabbing her bag,she turned and walked out.

Once she was gone, Jeremy remained where he was,raising a hand to rub his tired brow.

From outside, Edwin entered and placed a coat over Jeremy's shoulders. "Mr. Graham, it's late. You should head home and rest."

It had been a long day filled with corporate meetings and evening social events. Jeremy hadn't had a moment to unwind until now. Kayla's music had been soothing enough to lull him to sleep without him realizing it.

He looked up at Edwin. "How's the investigation coming?" and his hand shot up, seizing her wrist in a tight grip.

Kayla winced slightly, her brows furrowing from the sudden pressure.

He looked up at Edwin. "How's the investigation coming?" Edwin nodded. "I was just about to report. We checked the hotel guest list from that night. Zoe was indeed staying there. Apparently, she went out drinking with friends, got too drunk, and ended up booking a room. It looks like she accidentally walked into your suite."

Jeremy's expression darkened. "So it really was Zoe that night?"

"All evidence points to her. If it were someone else,we would've found something by now."

Just then, Edwin's phone rang. He glanced at the screen and said, "It's Zoe."

Jeremy took a sip of water, his tone calm. "Put her through."

Zoe's cheerful voice came through the speaker."Edwin, has Jeremy gone to bed already? I tried calling him, but couldn't get through."

Edwin looked at Jeremy. "He just finished a dinner meeting. Is there something you'd like me to pass along?"

"I was hoping to invite him to dinner tomorrow. Would that be aLright?"

Edwin glanced at Jeremy, who gave a subtle signal by tapping the table twice. "I'll inform Mr. Graham. If he's free tomorrow, we'll send you the details."

"Perfectl Thank voul" Zoe hung up. þarely able to contain her excitement. She turned and threw herself into Amaya's arms. "Mom, this is amazing! I think Jeremy agreed to dinner. He does not suspect anything!"

Amaya chuckled, pinching her daughter's-nose affectionately. "Sweetheart, you're truly gifted. Even someone as guarded as Jeremy can't help falling for you. I'll go make you something nourishing-you need to look your best tomorrow. He'll be enchanted,I promise."

"Okay!" Zoe beamed as her mother left the room.

Her smile was radiant-until her phone rang again. She glanced at the caller ID and the smile vanished."Darling, something's come up at home. I won't be able to meet you tonight."
###Chapter 87 Liam's Plea


A man's voice drifted through the phone. "Is there trouble at home? Weren't we supposed to meet tonight?"

Brushing aside the question, Zoe said with clear irritation, "I already said that I'mn not available tonight.Let's meet another day."

She didn't bother with further words. The call ended as she pressed the button, abrupt and final.

The man was the manager at that hotel. Lately, Zoe had gone to great lengths to seduce him. Once they'd had sex, she coaxed him into altering the guest records. This way, Jeremy's people wouldn't discover she was an imposter.

Once everything fell into place, a sense of victory washed over Zoe. She felt sure this would open the door for her and Jeremy once more. As she stretched out across her bed, her mind wandered into daydreams-she pictured herself walking beside him as his partner, sharing a life brimming with happiness.

"Jeremy, you'll be mine," she promised herself in a fierce whisper.

The moment Kayla entered her grandmother's ward,a water glass came flying in her direction. Her reflexes kicked in and dodged just in time, the glass skimming her cheek and exploding against the wall.

Without flinching, her eyes went cold as she glanced around the room.

Liam's finger jabbed at a caregiver as he let his temper loose. "Marsha is elderly. How hard is it to help her get to the bathroom? What if something happens and she falls? Why isn't anyone keeping an eye on her during the night? Accidents can happen. Are you willing to take that risk?"

Standing much shorter than him, the caregiver quivered and said softly, "It won't happen again."

But Liam's frustration lingered. "I've paid a lot for her care. If your attitude stays the same, you may as well pack and leave."

Remaining quiet, Kayla watched, piecing together the truth behind Liam's words. She caught on quickly-his anger wasn't aimed at the caregiver alone; it was meant for her as well.

Kicking a chair aside, she strode in and dropped the food container onto the table. Her words were sharp as frost. "What's with all the shouting this early? Do you want to wake Grandma?"

As if only just seeing her, Liam turned, exasperation written across his face. "You finally showed up, Kayla.Just look at this. The caregiver is hopeless. We should move Marsha somewhere with better care. You're always caught up with work. There's never enough time for family." Annoyance prickled at Kayla's nerves. She interrupted him without waiting for him to finish. "Why must you ramble endlessly? If you're that idle, find something better to do."

Liam's jaw tightened as her words echoed across the room,stinging with public embarrassment. He tried to steady himself. "Kayla, you know my only concern is for Marsha. Don't you want her to be safe and well taken care of?"

Without missing a beat, Kayla's lips curled in a cold,dismissive smile. "She's my grandma, so let me handle her care. You're raising your voice at the caregiver,but we both know you're really upset with me."

Liam struggled to keep his irritation at bay. "Let's just be clear. I don't want you wasting time at those useless parties anymore. After work, you come here.Spend your evenings with Marsha."

Kayla chose not to answer and instead made her way over to Marsha's side, chatting with her.

Marsha,whose mind wasn't as sharp as it used to be,didn't seem to notice the tension in the room. She was simply delighted to see Kayla. Grasping her hand,she asked, "Kayla, don't you have to be at work soon?I'd hate for you to be late."

With a reassuring squeeze, Kayla said, "No worries.There's still plenty of time. I want to stay here and keep you company." Liam's presence faded into the background as the warm exchange unfolded. Feeling dismissed, he spun on his heel and marched out of the room.

Later, Kayla left Marsha's bedside and discovered Liam brooding in the hallway,cigarette smoldering between his fingers. Raising her hand, she covered her nose."Didn't you see the 'No Smoking' sign? Or do you just ignore the rules?"

Rather than comply, Liam took a slow drag and let the smoke drift toward her, causing her to cough.

Fed up, Kayla headed down the hall, quickly returning with a security guard in tow.

"Sir, there's no smoking in this facility. I'm going to have to ask you to step outside," the guard said,wasting no time as he guided Liam away.

Throwing one last glance at Kayla, who watched from afar with an unreadable expression, Liam spoke, his voice low. "I need a word with you. Come out here for a minute."

Kayla offered no reply, choosing instead to return to Marsha's side. From outside, Liam bombarded her phone with message after message, refusing to let the matter drop.

By the time Kayla stepped out of the nursing home,dusk had started to settle outside. She wandered into a small cafe nearby,spotting Liam waiting for her with a cup of coffee in hand. The loosened tie and creased shirt lent him a look of studied indifference, as though he had nowhere better to be.

As soon as she appeared, half her face hidden behind a mask, Liam greeted her. "If the smoking was a problem, I'll quit right now."

Brushing aside his attempt at an apology, Kayla responded in a frosty tone, "You said you needed to talk. Make it quick. I'm only giving you five minutes."

Liam leaned forward, placing both palms on the tabletop, and fixed her with a solemn gaze. "You want to reclaim your mother's company, don't you? I'll settle every debt owed to Newton Group and hand Cooper Group back to you."

A faint, mocking chuckle slipped from Kayla. Her words dripped with disbelief. "You swore you'd never return Cooper Group to me. What's made you change your mind? Or did Perennia Group suddenly stumble into a windfall?"

There was a flicker of triumph in Liam's eyes as he replied, "Money won't be an issue, not with me running the show. I've ended things with Tricia. If I return Cooper Group to you, can we put aside this talk of divorce?"
###Chapter 88 Dancing For Jeremy
Kayla didn't waver as she replied,"No."

Liam's face tightened with frustration. "So you're not open to discussion at all?"

Rising from her seat, Kayla fixed him with a cold,unwavering stare. "We're going through the divorce,Liam. If I reclaim Cooper Group by myself, you'll be left with nothing to negotiate." Without waiting for his reaction, she turned on her heel and strode off,not once looking back.

All Liam could do was watch as she slipped into a cab and vanished down the street. He stayed rooted in place,hands clenched so tightly his knuckles whitened."I've swallowed my pride this far. Why won't she relent?"

Darkness soon crept over the city.

By dinnertime, Marsha had recovered a bit of her warmth and reached over, squeezing Kayla's hand in a gentle, affectionate gesture. "Kayla, are you really divorcing Liam? He's been running himself ragged these days, doing everything he can to help me. He really is a good man at heart."

Kayla slowly stirred her pasta, her expression unreadable. "Grandma, I've explained this before. Liam isn't who he once was. Everything he does now is calculated-he's just trying to manipulate me for his own benefit. I'm not the naive girl he fooled all those years ago. That version of me is gone."

Marsha's intentions were always kind. She still clung to the belief that love alone could heal any wound."Sweetheart, even if Liam made some mistakes, he's working hard to make up for them. Doesn't that count for something? Maybe you could find it in your heart to forgive him."

Setting her fork down with a quiet clink, Kayla met Marsha's gaze, her eyes shadowed but unwavering.

It wasn't hard to piece together what had happened.Liam had probably been feeding Marsha every excuse he could invent while she was not around. Now, every word out of Marsha's mouth sounded like she was reading straight from his script.

Only one thought crossed Kayla's mind-Liam really was something else.

The door swung open, and the new caregiver entered,arms full of oversized pots brimming with vibrant flowers. "Ma'am, these just arrived from overseas. Mr.Graham said you'd appreciate having something fresh to tend to, since you've been cooped up indoors."

Marsha's eyes went wide with delight. "Liam! He never forgets about me. He knew I'd feel restless and sent flowers to cheer me up. How thoughtful!"

The careqiver offered a quick smnile. "That's not all- there are quite a few other gifts waiting, too. Once you're finished with dinner, you might want to see for yourself."

Marsha beamed, clasping her hands together. "How wonderful! I'll have a look as soon as we're done eating."

Kayla sat through their conversation, every bite of her food growing more bland with each word.

A single realization crystallized in her mind-if she wanted this divorce finalized, Marsha needed to witness the truth about Liam for herself.



That evening at the Grand Court Hotel, Zoe had pulled out all the stops. She stepped into the lobby draped in a striking crimson gown, her hair cascading in flawless waves, and a team of stylists had perfected every detail of her makeup. She radiated elegance, looking every bit like she was about to command the runway.

Perched in the luxurious private dining room,she fidgeted with her compact mirror, anxiously touching up her makeup as she waited.

A voice called from the hallway, "Mr. Graham has arrived." That single announcement sent a rush of adrenaline through her. She sprang to her feet,smoothing her dress as she struggled to tamp down her excitement.

Jeremy entered, his deep purple shirt neatly tucked into impeccably tailored black slacks. Every movement radiated self-assurance, an easy authority filling the room.

Zoe moved closer, her gaze dropping shyly as she greeted him. "Jeremy."

A waiter pulled out the chair with a practiced flourish,and Jeremy took his seat with composed elegance."Hope I didn't keep you waiting."

Zoe slipped into the chair beside him, flashing a warm,eager smile. "Not at all. I only just arrived myself."

His gaze swept over the table, taking in the parade of luxurious dishes arranged like works of art. The sheer extravagance hardly registered anymore; he'd long since grown indifferent to this kind of opulence."All this for just the two of us? Don't you think it's a bit over the top?"

Zoe quickly reached for a fork and transferred a delicate portion onto his plate. "Please, give it a try.These are the chef's specialties. My parents have dined here before, and they raved about every dish."

Having grown up on lavish meals like these, Jeremy knew each flavor by heart. No matter the price or presentation, it all blurred together on his palate.

Even so, he didn't protest and reached for a fork, his every movement unhurried and refined.

A delighted gleam danced in Zoe's eyes as she gazed at him. "Please, help yourself. If this isn't enough, I'll call for more."

Jeremy paused, fork in hand, then gently nudged several meat-laden plates in her direction. "You should eat something,too."

Zoe shook her head with a quick, dismissive gesture."I'm not hungry, really. You enjoy."

She'd been rigidly restricting her diet for weeks now,steering clear of anything oily or carb-heavy-no matter how much she secretly craved it.

Jeremy glanced at her untouched plate, his tone mild but unmistakable. "In that case, don't go overboard with the ordering next time."

Just then, several waiters arrived, moving about the room as they set up instruments and adjusted the space for an impromptu performance.

With practiced poise, Zoe rose from her seat. "I've been working on a new dance. Would you like to see it?"

Jeremy offered a short nod. "If you're in the mood to perform,go ahead."

Zoe stepped into the center of the room and gestured for the staff to clear out. In moments, the two of them were alone.

Confidence radiated from her with every breath;tonight, she intended to win Jeremy over for good. When the music swelled, Zoe lifted herself gracefully onto her toes, launching into the choreography she'd rehearsed for weeks.

Each step flowed seamlessly into the next, her arms curving elegantly through the air, but to Jeremy, the whole performance felt empty-beautiful on the surface yet utterly devoid of warmth. He watched in silence, his expression unreadable, until his attention started to drift.

Absentmindedly, he picked up his phone, scrolling through notifications with a lazy flick of his thumb.A flash of color on his screen made him pause-a new update from Kayla had just appeared.
###Chapter 89 Can You Lend Me Some Money
Kayla sat at her desk, eyes locked on the frozen computer screen, a furrow forming between her brows. She had been grinding away at a project proposal when her laptop suddenly froze, spitting out a string of code she couldn't begin to understand.Not exactly tech-savvy,Kayla did the only thing she could think of and dropped a desperate plea for help on her Facebook.

Before long,suggestions came flooding in from her colleagues.

As Kayla scrolled through her phone, something made her thumb pause. Liam had liked her post. She was stunned.

She refreshed the page, only to watch the like vanish right before her eyes.

Kayla let out an incredulous chuckle, muttering,"Seriously? Like it, then take it back?"

Her mind flashed back to that awkward moment at the company meeting when she'd asked Edwin for his contact. Somehow, she ended up with Jeremy's number instead. She'd never dared to message him.

Now her inbox was a mess of private messages from colleagues offering ways to fix the glitch. She ped a photo of the error screen and began sending it to the ones who seemed to know what they were talking about.

Mid-swipe, her finger slipped and tapped Jeremy's chat. The photo sent before she could stop it.

By the time Kayla got back from the kitchen with her coffee, it was too late. She groaned, smacking her forehead.1

But she just assumed Jeremy wouldn't notice. He was probably too busy running his empire.

Suddenly,her phone buzzed.

She glanced down and froze. Jeremy had replied.

Kayla stared at the screen like it was made of gold,reading the message three times just to be sure.

It was short. Dry. A blunt, step-by-step instruction on how to reboot and update the system. No greeting, no sign-off,just pure Jeremy.

Kayla followed his directions,restarted the laptop,ran the update. Just like that, the glitch was gone.

Back in his chat, she typed the only response that felt safe."Thanks."

There was no reply.

Kayla sighed, set her phone down, and got back to work. Meanwhile, Zoe had just wrapped up her solo dance routine, sweat glistening at the nape of her neck. She turned around with a hopeful smile, only to find Jeremy glued to his phone.

Her smile faltered and she pouted. "Jeremy, were you even watching?"

Jeremy looked up, his voice measured. "I was.Looked good.Keep at it."

It wasn't exactly glowing praise, but Zoe took what she could get. She beamed, gliding over to him and tugging gently at his arm. "I've been dying to learn the waltz. Will you dance it with mne?"

Jeremy raised an eyebrow. This wasn't his thing.

Zoe leaned closer, her arm brushing his, voice sweet as honey. "Just one dance?"

Before he could answer, a bodyguard stepped into the room,cutting the moment short.

Jeremy eased Zoe aside and listened as the man whispered something in his ear. His face remained unreadable as he gave a slight nod.

Zoe,clearly out of the loop, tried reading their faces.Then another man entered the room. It was Liam.

Zoe's smile fell right off her face. She glared at Liam -he'd just ruined her night with Jeremy.

Liam didn't flinch. He strode past her, straight to Jeremy, offering a respectful nod. "Uncle Jeremy, I need a moment of your time."

Jeremy sipped his coffee, unbothered. "Thought you and your mother were having a good time. What brings you here?"

Liam's tone softened. "Whatever's going on between you and my mother-it's not my fight. I'm here because I need help."

Jeremy said nothing. He idly traced the rim of his coffee cup.

Liam shot a glance at Zoe, then raised his voice slightly. "Maybe anyone who's not part of this conversation should step out?"

Zoe's jaw clenched. "Watch your mouth,Liam."

He didn't miss a beat. "Until you've officially married my uncle, maybe don't act like you own the place."

Zoe nearly lost it, but with Jeremy present,she forced herself to hold back. She turned to him with a dramatic pout. "Did you hear that, Jeremy? I have no idea what I did to deserve that tone."

Jeremy met her gaze, calm as ever. "Leave us."

Zoe scoffed, heels clicking furiously as she stormed out.

The moment the door closed behind her, Liam leaned in and lowered his voice. "Uncle Jeremy,can you lend me some money?"
###Chapter 90 You Totally Had That Coming  
Jeremy's lips curled into a faint smile. "What's going on? Why are you suddenly coming to me for money?"

Liam glanced up, his expression respectful but cautious. "You're now a shareholder in Perennia Group.I'm sure you've reviewed its internal affairs. I'm strapped for funds and was hoping you could help."

Jeremy studied him. "How much are we talking?"

Liam raised a single finger and furrowed his brows."Ten million."

Jeremy absentmindedly ran his fingers along the rim of his cup, the corners of his mouth twitching. "And what makes you think I'd give that to you?"

"To be honest, it's to clear some debts and to buy Cooper Group back. If I pull that off, Kayla won't divorce me." Liam hesitated, then added, "Ten million's impossible for me. But for you, it's pocket change. I've never asked you for anything before. Just this once."

The cup in Jeremy's hand slipped, shattering on the floor.

Liam blinked but quickly moved to clean it, picking up the shards with a tissue and tossing them in the trash with care.

Before he could straighten, Jeremy grabbed him by the collar and yanked him up, eyes sharp and ice cold.

"Is this your mother's idea?"

"No," Liam said quickly, shaking his head. "This is between you and me. My mother doesn't meddle in Perennia Group's affairs."

With a sharp shove, Jeremy released him. Liam stumbled back, landing hard on the floor.

Jeremy adjusted his cuffs, looking down with disdain."If your mother weren't Janiya, I might have considered it."

Without another word, he stepped over Liam and strode out of the room.

Liam stayed on the floor, hands clenched, face darkening with anger.

Outside the door, Zoe, who had been shamelessly eavesdropping, jumped when it swung open. She clutched her chest, feigning innocence. "Jeremy!You're done already?"

Jeremy gave her a dismissive nod and kept walking.

Zoe peeked into the room, catching sight of Liam on the floor, looking thoroughly wrecked. She sneered and muttered, "You totally had that coming."

Then,seeing Jeremy getting farther away,she clicked her heels after him. "Jeremy, wait for me!"

Once they were gone, Liam's assistant hurried in and reached out to help him up. "Sir, are you okay?"

Liam angrily slapped the hand away. "I don't need help.I'm fine."

The assistant hesitated, then spoke carefully. "Maybe we should give up on raising the funds. If even your uncle won't help, there might not be another way."

"Shut up!" Liam snapped. His voice trembled with fury."I'll remember this. One day, when I surpass him,I'll make him pay back this humiliation tenfold."

The assistant mumbled under his breath,doubting Liam could ever reach that level, but wisely kept the thought to himself.

Just then, Liam's phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen and let out a groan. It was the caregiver. He picked up. "What is it?"

"Mr. Graham, the massage bed for Marsha has arrived.Would you like to come inspect it?"

"What's there to see? It's just a bed. Handle it yourselves," Liam replied, irritation mounting.

There was a pause. "Sir, you specifically asked us to notify you when it arrived."

Liam pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed. "Fine.I'll come now." ...

Kayla finished her work and took Marsha for a stroll in the park. When they returned, she stopped in the doorway, spotting a new massage bed set up in the room.

Her brows drew together. "What's this? Please have it moved next door. It's not suitable for her condition."

The caregiver stepped forward. "Mr. Graham arranged for it. He said it would help with your grandmother's recovery."

Kayla bit her tongue. Liam, who barely acknowledged Marsha's health, was now an expert in physical therapy?

She scoffed. With the help of two security guards, the bed was relocated into an empty room.

At 3 PM, Kayla got a call from Archie reminding her of a project meeting at North Investment.

After settling Marsha, she rushed over, only to be informed the meeting had been delayed by an hour.

Already outside the conference room, Kayla sat down to review her materials.

Just then, Jeremy's secretary, Edna Hilton, approached."Kayla,here for the North Investment meeting?"

Kayla nodded. Noticing the boxes of cold medicine in Edna's hands, she asked, "Are you feeling sick?" Edna shook her head. "It's for MAr. Graham. He's got a fever but refuses to rest. Edwin asked me to bring this up to him."

Kayla blinked. Even with a fever, Jeremy was working?No wonder North Investment was unstoppable.

Suddenly, Edna's phone rang. She answered, her tone brisk. "Yes. Understood. I'll head there now."

After hanging up, she turned to Kayla. "Would you mind taking this up for me? The records department just dumped a new pile of files on me."

Before Kayla could object, Edna pressed the medicine into her hands and hurried off down the hall.
###Chapter 91 He's Sick

Kayla reached Jeremy's office with the medicine and knocked on the door, but no one answered.

She eased the door open and saw Jeremy seated at his desk, his posture weary and his features drawn.

His head drooped, one hand pressed to his forehead,betraying just how sick he felt.

"I'm coming in," Kayla announced and placed the medicine on his desk. "Edna sent me over with this. If you're not feeling well,you ought to take it right away."

Jeremy gave no reply, his fatigue making him seem even more distant.

A pile of paperwork lay untouched before him, and Kayla decided not to intrude any further. "I'll get out of your hair now."

Only as she turned to go did Jeremy stir from his daze.His hand shot out, and before she knew it, he'd caught her by the wrist.

His grasp didn't waver. In one swift movement,he drew her onto his lap.

Heat flooded her cheeks as surprise sent her heart racing.

Kayla's gasp broke the stillness, her palm brushing against his burning skin. "Jeremy, you've got a fever!"

His eyes fixed on her, Jeremy seemed unwilling to let her go. He turned away just slightly, murmuring, "I'm alright."

A hand to his forehead left Kayla visibly worried."You're running a temperature, and you're still insisting you're fine? You never look after yourself."

Attempting torise, she found his arms circling her waist,keeping her close.

He leaned in, resting his head against her shoulder,as if the contact soothed him. His voice was a low whisper. "You did bring the medicine, didn't you? Let me have it."

Warmth flooded Kayla's cheeks as she pressed her hands against Jeremy's chest. "Let me go or I can't get the medicine," she insisted.

With a quiet sigh, Jeremy finally let his arms fall away,his reluctance obvious.

She wasted no time in retreating, feeling her heartbeat racing wildly in her chest.

Looking at him, she saw none of his usual composure;instead, he appeared frail, almost like a lost kitten searching for shelter.

Touching her face to cool the blush, Kayla murmured under her breath, "Don't read too much into a sick guy's actions." Without delay, Kayla poured some water, snapped open the medicine, and stretched out her hand with both ready for him. Jeremy just turned his head,frowning,his refusal clear.

Kayla sighed, exasperated. "You asked for the medicine, but now you're being difficult?"

Jeremy winced, eyes squeezed shut. "It tastes awful."

"You're exaggerating! These are the easiest pills to swallow," she retorted, moving closer to coax the medicine past his lips. Jeremy stubbornly pressed his mouth closed.

"Take it whenever you feel like it." Defeated, Kayla set both the glass and the medicine on his desk.

His gaze followed her briefly, but he didn't protest or call her back. Leaning forward, he pressed his forehead to his hand, eyes closing as if even holding himself upright took effort.

Just as she reached for the handle, Kayla paused,worry tugging at her. "Leaving him like this would only cause problems," she murmured.

Resolving not to let things get worse, she hurried back,helped Jeremy sit straighter, and placed the pill in his mouth, following with a drink of water.

The attempt didn't go smoothly. Jeremy coughed and spluttered, pushing her away while grabbing the desk for support. Heat crept up Kayla's neck as she froze in place."That was too much water-sorry about that."

A moment passed before Jeremy's gaze sharpened,some of the confusion lifting. His tone came out cool and measured. "Take me to the lounge. I need to lie down."

"Alright." Kayla moved to his side, doing her best to support his weight as they shuffled out of the office.

The opulence of Jeremy's private lounge struck her.The chandelier scattered glimmering light over thick carpets, and every piece of furniture seemed tailored for comfort and wealth.

Kayla marveled inwardly. "So this is how the wealthy live."

She carefully helped Jeremy navigate the plush floor until they reached a sprawling bed.

Exhaustion overtook Jeremy immediately. He collapsed into the mattress, tugged the blanket around his shoulders, and surrendered to fatigue.

When his breathing slowed and his eyes slid shut,Kayla began to slip quietly from the room.

Suddenly, a wave of nausea swept over her. Hand clamped over her mouth, she rushed into the bathroom.

The lounge filled with the harsh sounds of her dry heaving. Restlessness pulled Jeremy from his sleep. He blinked through the haze, catching sight of Kayla's silhouette bent over the sink.

Only after the sickness passed did Kayla straighten,studying her own reflection in the bathroom mirror.

Morning sickness, which she'd thought had faded,had come surging back with no warning.

Relief washed over her as she noticed Jeremy still appeared to be asleep, blissfully unaware of what had just happened.

After shutting off the tap, Kayla drew in a steadying breath, her hand unconsciously coming to rest on her stomach as she made her way back into the lounge.

"There's no reason to push yourself. If you're not well,just take the day to recover."

The suddenness of Jeremy's words made Kayla's hand fly to the doorframe for support, her body spinning toward him, caught completely off guard.

From where he rested, Jeremy watched her intently his face still drained of color but his gaze unyielding and sharp.
###Chapter 92 Hiding In His Room
Kayla forced herself to keep her composure. "I'm not sick or anything. My stomach's just a little upset because of the irregular diet."

Jeremy's voice was frosty. "Just don't mess up my bathroom."

Heat rushed to her cheeks, but she managed a stiff nod. "It won't happen again. I'll get out of your way Take care."

She offered him a brief, awkward nod before hurrying toward the door.

However, voices drifted from just outside the CEO's office.

"Is Jeremy in there? I heard he's under the weather, so I stopped by to check on him," Zoe said to the assistant.

The assistant replied, "He's busy right now.Would you like me to let him know you're here?"

"No need, I'll head in myself." With that, Zoe pushed the office door open

Acting on instinct, Kayla ducked back into the lounge and quietly pulled the door shut behind her. Jeremy, catching the movement, glanced over his shoulder. "Why are you still here?"

She turned the lock with a soft click, her brows knitting together. "Zoe is here."

If Zoe saw her and Jeremy alone in the same room,she would undoubtedly cause a scene.

In the thick of her divorce from Liam, she couldn't afford to let any rumors stir up more trouble.

At the mention of Zoe, Jeremy's face tightened. "Just walk out like it's nothing."

Before he could finish his sentence, a sharp knock sounded at the lounge door.

Zoe's gentle voice drifted through. "Jeremy, are you inside?"

Kayla darted a look around the room, then slipped behind a decorative screen without a word.

Jeremy watched her scramble for cover and let out a weary sigh.

Did she honestly find being spotted with him that humiliating?

From the other side of the door, Zoe's voice rose in warning. "If you don't answer, I'm coming in."

Jeremy,too dizzy to bother, didn't say a word. Zoe,hearing only silence, twisted the doorknob, but it wouldn't budge.

She clenched her jaw, rattled the handle twice, and called out in mild confusion, "Why's the door locked?It's me, Zoe. Open up,will you?"

Jeremy, irked by her persistence, hit the remote beside the bed, and the lock clicked open.

Zoe's whole expression brightened as she stepped in with deliberate poise, the sharp click of her heels echoing across the floor. "Jeremy, I heard you weren't feeling well. I didn't realize it was this serious-you're actually stuck in bed."

Kayla, hidden behind the screen, strained to catch every word.

Jeremy straightened up with a distant air and said,"I need sleep. Unless it's important, please go."

Ignoring his words, Zoe perched herself on the bed and reached out to touch his forehead. "Oh no, you're burning up! Why haven't you gone to see a doctor?"

Jeremy shot her down without hesitation. "That's not necessary."

A glimmer of calculation sparked in Zoe's eyes-she recognized the perfect chance to close the distance between them.

Without warning, she clung to his arm. "I have a home remedy that works wonders for a fever. Let's give it a shot."

Jeremy's rejection was cold and immediate. "No.thanks. I've already taken my medication."

"Medicine won't act that fast. Just let me help you,"Zoe insisted, her fingers drifting toward the buttons of his shirt.

He caught her wrist in a steely grip, his expression turning thunderous. "What exactly are you doing?"

Feigning innocence, Zoe fluttered her lashes. "I'm just unbuttoning your shirt. A warm towel will bring your fever down much faster."

Kayla couldn't hold back a silent snort.

Even so, her curiosity got the better of her; she edged forward for a better look at how Jeremy would respond to Zoe's outrageous stunt.

Unfortunately, Jeremy noticed Kayla's action. His expression grew even more severe, as if questioning whether she was there simply for the entertainment.

Zoe had already undone his shirt, exposing his flawlessly toned chest. The sight made her breath hitch in her throat.

Jeremy moved to brush Zoe off, but upon catching Kayla spying, a spark of mischief flashed across his eyes. He turned to Zoe, voice slow and intentional "So you're convinced this remedy works?" Kayla's brows lifted in disbelief. Was Jeremy seriously playing along with Zoe's ridiculous act?

Zoe beamed, barely able to contain her delight."Absolutely! After all, we've already been close,so there's nothing awkward about me taking care of you like this."

Jeremy remained silent, his face giving nothing away.

Zoe soon returned with a wet towel and began dabbing his bare shoulders with exaggerated care.

Watching this scene unfold, Kayla felt a wave of revulsion mixed with disbelief. Zoe's reputation was an open secret-she'd been cycling through boyfriends since high school, her personal life a string of messy scandals. Did Jeremy really have no concerns about her questionable past?
###Chapter 93 Her Lips Brushed His Bare Chest
Zoe sat behind Jeremy, her eyes tracing every line of his perfectly sculpted frame. She kept inching closer,drawn in by his charm.

But Jeremy felt the shift in energy. Just as Zoe was about to press against him, he pushed her away.

Caught off guard, she lost her balance and tumbled off the edge of the bed, landing on the floor with a dull thud. The impact left hermomentarily dazed.

Jeremy grabbed a thin blanket and wrapped it around himself. His voice was cold, distant. "I'mn feeling much better now. You can go."

But Zoe wasn't ready to give up that easily. Still on the floor, she looked up at him with wide, pleading eyes."You're still unwell. Let me stay and take care of you."

"Leave." His voice remained calm, but the impatience in his eyes made his meaning crystal clear.

Reluctantly, Zoe rose and smoothed her dress. "Fine.I'll come back to check on you later."

As she turned to go, something caught her eye-a flash of fabric peeking from behind the decorative screen. A woman's garment, not doubt. "Who's there?" Zoe's expression darkened. Without hesitation, she marched over, ready to confront whoever was hiding.

But before she could yank the screen aside, a strong hand seized her wrist.

Startled, Zoe spun around, her eyes filled with anger and hurt. "Jeremy, who's back there? Is it that same woman from before?"

Jeremy's face was unreadable, his tone colder than ever."My personal life is none of your concern.Leave."

Tears welled up in Zoe's eyes, spilling over as she stumbled back a few steps, visibly shaken. "How can you treat me like this? I gave myself to you, and now you're just casting me aside? What will people think when they find out? How can I face anyone?"

For the first time, Jeremy's stern expression wavered,a flicker of guilt crossing his face.

Zoe wiped her cheeks, her voice low and aching. "l won't ask about it. I know a man like you-rich,powerful-must attract a lot of attention. I'm probably not the only one who likes you. But you promised to marry me. I trusted you, Jeremy. Please, don't make me regret it."

Behind the screen, Kayla stood with her arms crossed,a faint smirk tugging at her lips. She had to admit-Zoe's performance was dripping cerity. If she were Jeremy, she might've been swayed too.

Jeremy's posture softened, his voice dropping to a quieter note. "Just go."
Sensing his hesitation, Zoe looked up at him with tear -filled eyes, her gaze tender and unrelenting. "I'll wait for you. I'll wait until I'm the only woman by your side."

With that, she turned and walked out, the door clicking shut behind her.

A beat of silence passed before Kayla stepped out from behind the screen, her tone cool. "Sorry for the misunderstanding. I'll be going now."

In her rush, she didn't see the edge of the rug. Her foot caught, and she stumbled forward-straight into Jeremy. The force sent him back onto the bed, and in an instant, she landed squarely on top of him, their position undeniably intimate.

Her lips brushed his bare chest. She froze, cheeks flaming red.

Jeremy sucked in a sharp breath at the warmth of her accidental touch.

For a moment, he didn't move. His hand reached instinctively toward her, ready to pull her closer.Then he stopped

Zoe's words echoed in his mind, a bitter reminder of his obligations. His growing lack of self-controlound Kayla was starting to unsettle him.

He shoved her away and rose, grabbing a shirt and throwing it on. "You can go," he said, his voice tight and composed.

Kayla,breathless and flustered, pushed herself up, her chest heaving as she tried to steady her pulse.Without a word, she rushed out of the lounge.

Heart pounding, she made her way to the break room and grabbed a glass of water, taking a few fast gulps in a desperate attempt to cool down.

Just then, Edna walked in, noticing Kayla's flushed face. "Are you all right?"

Kayla tightened her grip on the glass and turned to her with a forced smile. "I'm fine."

Her cheeks were still tinged pink, her expression caught somewhere between panic and disbelief.

Edna gave her a curious look but chose not to pry."Mr. Graham's not feeling well today. He sent out a notice-the vice president will lead the meeting in his place. It's starting soon. You should head over."

"Got it." Kayla patted her cheeks, trying to bring herself back to reality as she followed Edna down the hallway

She took a deep breath, trying to calm her nerves. But no matter how hard she tried, the memory of what happened in that lounge refused to leave her alone.
###Chapter 94 He Will Marry Zoe


In his villa, Jeremy, in a fitted black pajama set, made his way down the winding staircase, each step more confident than the last-proof that his strength had returned.

In the living room, Dewitt sprawled out on the sofa, absentmindedly turning a cup in his hands. "You really can't stay away from work, can you? You drag Edwin and me over here to talk business when you're just getting over an illness. Honestly, Jeremy, you've got enough money. Take a vacation for once!"

Jeremy shot Dewitt a disdainful look."You sound like a nagging grandmother. Next thing, you'll be signing up for knitting lessons."

Instead of letting it go, Dewitt rolled his eyes, grabbed the nearest pillow, and lobbed it at him."What a cheap shot. I'm rethinking our friendship, Jeremy."

Catching the pillow with one hand, Jeremy tossed it right back, only for Dewitt to dodge with practiced ease.

A moment later, Edwin entered the room, settling a jacket over Jeremy's shoulders."How are you holding up, Mr. Graham?" he asked, his concern clear.

With a slight shrug, Jeremy replied, "A good night's sleep did the trick. Fever's gone."

Relief flickered across Edwin's face. "Glad to hear it. There's something I should update you about."

Jeremy took a seat beside Dewitt, poured himself some water, and sipped it with deliberate calm. "Let's hear it."

"Liam left empty-handed last time. I arranged for someone to monitor him, and he's been hustling for funds.Just recently, he sold a cemetery owned by Perennia Group to a real estate company-they're planning to turn it into a pig farm."
The news sent Dewitt into a fit of laughter. He straightened up and shook his head. "Has Liam completely lost it? Desperate enough to sell graveyards now? Wait until the curses start coming for him!" Jeremy's features tightened with interest. He glanced at Edwin. "If memory serves, that land belonged to Cooper Group,right?

Edwin nodded. "Exactly. That cemetery sits on premium real estate. Kayla's mother refused to let it go while she was alive, and after she passed, she was laid to rest there."

Mischief danced across Dewitt's face as he clapped, delighted by the drama."With Kayla'sfiery streak,she'll make a scene when she catches wind of this."

A subtle flicker of intent sparked in Jeremy's eyes as he shot Edwin a significant look.

Reading the signal instantly, Edwin responded, "I caught wind of Liam's negotiations early. The papers aren't finalized yet, and Kayla doesn't know a thing."

Jeremy's fingers traced idle patterns along his cup, his nod barely noticeable. "Fill her in."

"Understood." Edwin bowed his head and left the room.

Before Jeremy could enjoy a moment of quiet, Dewitt swung an arm around his shoulder, his features settling into a sly grin. "You're not obligated to bring Kayla into this, but here you are, making sure she's in the loop. What'sreally going on?"

Jeremy slid out from Dewitt's hold, arching a brow. "What are you implying?"

With a knowing smirk, Dewitt pressed on. "Edwin let slip that you and Kayla have been spending extra time together.So,come clean-do you have feelings for her?"

Jeremy didn't respond. Instead, he poured himself a cup of coffee and took a sip.

Dewitt, undeterred, leaned back with a broader grin, his tone both teasing and direct. "You know your own heart. If you like her, go help her get rid of Liam-"

The words cut short as Jeremy interjected,"That's not it."

Dewitt's playful mask slipped for a beat, replaced by uncharacteristic gravity.11|SZoe the reason? Are you hesitating because of her?" Cool and unwavering, Jeremy answered, "I'll marry Zoe."

Dewitt didn't hold back his opinion. "Still, I think Kayla suits you better. Sometimes you have to trust your instincts."

Jeremy patted Dewitt's shoulder and stood up. "How about a round on the court?"

Dragging himself to his feet with a dramatic sigh, Dewitt replied, "Whenever things get serious,you find a way to wriggle out of it."



Meanwhile, Kayla passed a precisely arranged stack of paperwork to Archie, waiting at his desk for him to look it over. In the midst of the quiet, her phone buzzed unexpectedly.

A new message flashed across the screen, this one from an unfamiliar number, warning her that Liam was planning to sell her mother's burial ground.

She stared hard at the screen, reading the words again and again, wondering who could have sent.such news.

Anger burned in her chest as she clenched her phone. How could Liam stoop to that? That man had no shame.

Picking up on the shift in her mood, Archie set the documents aside, his tone gentle with concern. "Kayla, is everything alright? Did something just happen?"
###Chapter 95 Where Is Liam


Switching off her phone, Kayla gave her head a gentle shake. "It's nothing important, Mr. Newton. All my tasks are finished, so I'll be leaving now."

Warmth filled Archie's voice as he stopped her. "Hold on, Kayla. There's something I want to talk to you about."

Straightening up, she offered a respectful nod. "Of course. What is it?"

Without a word, Archie produced a check from his drawer and placed it in front of her.

A quick glance at the amount made Kayla pause, her eyes widening at the sight of five million written across it.Puzzlement colored her question. "What's this about?"

Regret clouded Archie's face as he explained, "I heard about the incident with Isaac last time. He's been my business associate for years, and I should have recognized his character sooner. This is for the trouble and fear you went through. As your employer, it's my duty to make amends."

Refusing the gesture, Kayla slid the check back across the desk. "You don't have to do this. You aren't responsible for his actions. Honestly, I should be thanking you for employing me and paying me so well.There's no way I could accept such a large sum."

Determined, Archie pushed the check toward her again. "Kayla, I insist. If you refuse, I'll never forgive myself."

A quiet smile appeared as Kayla stood. "Really, that's not necessary. If you truly want to make things up to me, you could always speed up the process of transferring Cooper Group."

Grabbing her bag, she added, "Just teasing. I'll be heading out now."

The sight of Kayla leaving left Archie staring at the untouched check, a thoughtful glint sharpening his gaze.

His assistant approached with a hint of admiration. "She turned down five million without a second thought. She's on the brink of divorcing Liamn and facing a rough future, but money means nothing to her."

A sharp glance from Archie ended the conversation. "Back to work."

Moments later, Kayla exited the building and climbed into a waiting taxi. "Perennia Group, please."

Her arrival at Perennia Group was met with disappointing news from the secretary-Liam was out of the office for the day.

Perched in the general manager's office, Kayla exuded an unmistakable chill, her flawless features set in an expression that brooked no nonsense. That frosty presence sent shivers through the new secretary, who hovered nearby and looked as though she'd rather be anywhere else.

Raising her eyes at last, Kayla addressed the young woman. "Do you happen to know where he's gone?"

A nervous shake of the head was all the secretary could manage.′′MrIr. Graham didn't mention anything."

Curiosity flickered as Kayla took in the girl's fresh-faced beauty. Evidently, Liam hadn't wasted time-Tricia's exit had only opened the door for yet another attractive hire.

With a polite smile, Kayla rose and offered a reassuring nod. "Don't worry about it. Just keep up with your work."

Gratefully, the secretary stepped aside, breathing easier as Kayla swept past.
No sooner had the door closed than relief flooded the secretary's face. She pressed a hand to her chest and whispered, "Nobody told me the boss's wife could freeze the air. She nearly scared the life out of me."

Outside, the taxi waited while Kayla placed a call, her lips curving into a cool, knowing smile."Tyrone, care to tell me where Liam's hiding today?".

As Liam's assistant, Tyrone Smith was rarely in the dark about his boss's whereabouts.

"I'm not sure where Mr. Graham is. Maybe try reaching him yourself?"

A soft laugh escaped Kayla. Her tone remained calm, yet every word carried weight. "I'mn sure you remember that I helped your wife land her job. She's thriving now-just got a promotion, in fact. Imagine if l happened to share those old fund issues with her new boss. What do you think would become of her?

Panic was immediate in Tyrone's voice. "Please, Mrs. Graham, I'm begging you. Have mercy.My family needs this.Don't ruin us."

With a cold, dismissive snort, Kayla drove her point home."SO1,are you ready to be honest about where Liamis?"

Tyrone hemmed and hawed.

"Spit it out. Where is he?"

Panic took hold of Tyrone, forcing the words out of him. "Azure Oasis Grand Hotel! That's where he is!"

A hotel in the middle of the day-Kayla needed no further explanation. Clearly, Liam wasn't there for business or sleep.

A cold, predatory smile tugged at her lips as she hung up. Slipping on her sunglasses, she addressed the driver with quiet command. "Head to Azure Oasis Grand Hotel."

At the hotel, a wave of sweet, perfumed air drifted out the moment Liam pushed open the door.

All around, the room shimmered with celebration-heart-shaped rose petals adorned the bed, and intimate trinkets lay carefully arranged nearby.

Heat surged through him as he took it all in, somnething inside him sparking to life.

At the door, Liam scanned the space, but not a soul was in sight. He raised his voice and said, "Tricia, quit playing games. You've been hounding me with calls and texts just to drag me here. Now thatI've come,where are you hiding?"

Silence answered him; the room gave nothing away.

With a huff, he strode inside and slammed the door, determination in every step. "Let's see what scheme you've cooked up this time."

Steam curled from the private hot spring at the far end, rose petals dotting the surface. A sleek, femininefigure lounged among the fragrant water.

Draped in a black camisole, Tricia waited, her long hair tumbling down her back, her posture dripping with confidence.

Smug satisfaction played at her lips as the noise behind her caught her attention. She shifted deliberately,making sure he noticed her.

Soon, Liam strode up to the pool, shadow falling over her as he glared down. "Enough with the games,Tricia. I've given you everything you asked for. I told you-leave me alone. Why keep pestering me?"

In an instant, Tricia lunged sideways, cupped her hand, and flung a splash of water into his face. Not missing a beat, she grabbed his wrist and yanked him into the water with her.
###Chapter 96 Caught Them In The Scene


Water exploded over Liam's head, drenching him from head to toe. He spluttered, thrown off balance as he tried to wriggle free from Tricia's grasp in the pool.

But Tricia had him right where she wanted--her arms coiled stubbornly around his neck, her lips crashing into his in a hungry, unrestrained kiss.

Liam tensed, halfway to protesting, but Tricia's nimble fingers were already at her straps. In a fluid, fearless motion, she slipped out of her dress, her warm skin pressing insistently against him. She knew exactly how to unravel him. Her gentle touch glided over his chest, teasing downward, coaxing a sharp, involuntary breath from his lips.

A jolt of pleasure shot through Liam, wiping away any last trace of resistance. His body reacted before his mind could catch up-blood pounding,self-control vanishing in the heat of her advances.

Tricia's kisses deepened, overwhelming his senses until he lost track of everything but her.

She maneuvered him to the edge of the pool, easing him onto the slick tiles. Her body hovered between his legs, her head lowering as her lips explored further, sending his thoughts scattering.

Liam couldn't stop the rough groan that escaped him-a raw, desperate sound. In that fevered moment,the only thing he wanted was to flip Tricia beneath him and reclaim control.

While Tricia worked to overwhelm him with her urgent affection, Liam abruptly seized her shoulders and pinned her down. He kissed her again and again-his hunger palpable, his touch almost feverish.

Tricia's lips curled in smug delight, her eyes glinting with satisfaction.

Out in the corridor, Kayla marched beside the hotel manager, her heels echoing on the marble.

They paused before a closed door, where the manager, all deference and nervous energy, bowed low. "Mrs.Graham, Mr. Graham entered this room." Earlier, Kayla had slipped him a folded bill with practiced ease, coaxing the room number from his lips.

She sized up the door, eyes narrowed in cold amusement. Her lips curled into a razor-sharp smirk."And there's another woman in there, you said?"

The manager bobbed his head, his voice low. "Yes. The woman checked in first, and Mr. Graham joined her."

He reached for his keycard, but Kayla stopped him with a flick of her wrist."Hand it over. I'll take it from here."

The manager obeyed without hesitation,pressing the card into her palm before slipping away down the hall.

Alone, Kayla toyed with the keycard, tapping it against her manicured nails as she regarded the door with a cool,calculating glint in her eyes. "So the two of you really can't stay apart? Let's see how close you are after this."

With a triumphant smirk curling her lips, she slipped the card into her pocket and strolled off, utterly self-assured.

Inside, the lovers had tumbled from the steaming spring straight onto the bed.

The air practically crackled with tension as Tricia wrapped her arms tightly around Liam's neck, gasping between ragged breaths. "Go easy, darling. I can't take any more!"

Before he could answer, the door slammed open, rattling on its hinges. A figure in all black-hat pulled low,face hidden behind a surgical mask-burst inside, brandishing a camera.

The shutter clicked furiously, freezing the chaos in merciless flashes.

In a split second, the spell shattered. Liam, teetering on the edge of release, was wrenched back to reality.Rage surged through him. He sprang up, muscles taut with fury. "Who the fuck are you? What do you think you're doing? Get out,now!"

Tricia, utterly naked and terrified, shrieked and flung herself into Liam's arms, clinging for dear life."He′S taking pictures. Stop him!"

But the masked figure had already darted back out the door, camera in hand.
Furious, Liam snatched a towel and stormed into the hallway, barely bothering to cover himself as he chased after the figure. Tricia lay sprawled on the bed, shivering and breathless, her complexion drained of color.

Outside, Liam scanned the empty corridor, chest heaving with rage. "Coward! You've got the guts to barge in and snap pictures, but not to face me? Come back and try it again!" he roared, his voice echoing down the hall.

Hotel doors creaked open as startled guests poked their heads out, murmuring in confusion at the half-naked man yelling in the hallway.

The weight of their stares made Liam's face burn with humiliation. He turned on his heel and slammed the door,jaw clenched in frustration.

A flight of stairs away, Kayla leaned against the wall, coolly peeling off her mask. She turned the camera over in her hands, her smile sharp as glass, eyes glinting with satisfaction.

Through clenched teeth, she muttered in a voice as firm as ice, "Liam, how dare you mess with my mother's grave! Did you think I'd let that go?"

Back inside the suite, any trace of intimacy had vanished, replaced by a suffocating tension.

Tricia slipped into her dress, hugging herself as she perched on the edge of the bed, her eyes rimmed with red. "Do you think those photos will get posted? I'm not worried about myself-but you're the head of Perennia Group. If this gets out, it could destroy everything."

Liam, halfway through buttoning his shirt, turned with a thundercloud brewing in his eyes. "If you really cared about my career, you wouldn't have dragged me to this place in the first place. Whoever set this up clearly planned it to corner me.

Tricia reached for his arm, desperation sharpening her voice."Could it have been Kayla? What if she's trying to collect proof of your affair?"

He slipped his hand free with a cold gentleness. "Kayla's known about us for ages. If she wanted to nail me,she wouldn't have waited until now." Hearing him defend his soon-to-be ex-wife shattered what was left of Tricia's composure. "She's already leaving you, and you're still on her side?"

"So I should trust you instead, is that it?" Liam shot her a venomous glare. "Do you even understand what this divorce is going to cost me? Are you going to cover that for me?"

A bitter,hollow laugh escaped Tricia. "Right. So deep down, you still see me as less than her."

Liam smoothed down his collar, tying his necktie with practiced indifference. "This isn't the moment to talk about it. I need to figure out who set this up. Go home."

He strode out, slamming the door behind him with a final, angry crack. Tricia, shaking with rage, seized a pillow and hurled it at the door.

"Liam, you're such a sucker! Kayla couldn't care less about you!"
###Chapter 97 Liam's Affair Exposed


By eleven o'clock that night, the Graham family's grand estate was still ablaze with light, nearly every family member assembled in the vast hall.

At the center of it all, Kayla held her head high, posture uwavering, a glacial calm set across her features.

"Grandpa, you asked me to come home right away. What's so urgent?" Liam entered at a brisk pace,confusion flickering across his face. His steps faltered as his eyes landed on Kayla, shock settling over him.

He had called and messaged Kayla countless times but got no response, yet here she was.

She offered no explanation, remaining as distant as ever, her expression carved from ice.

Suddenly,Johnny seized his water glass and hurled it at Liam. A cold splash spread across Liam's shirt and jacket.

Janiya sprang to Liam's side, arms spread protectively. "Dad, please don't lose your temper! We haven't even heard his side yet. What if this is all just a big misunderstanding?"

Rage flushed Johnny's face an angry red. He jabbed a shaking finger at Liam, voice thundering across the room."You call yourself a Graham? How could you do something so disgraceful? Your actions have humiliated this entire family!"

Utterly bewildered, Liam brushed Janiya's hands away and stepped closer to his grandfather. "Grandpa,you're furious, but I don't even know what I'm accused of. At least tell me what's happened!"

Johnny flung a phone at him, hisanger so intense it triggered a fit of coughing.

Quick as ever, Janiya hurried to Johnny's side, steadying him and casting a pointed glare at Kayla."Dad,please don't jump to conclusions just because of what Kayla might've told you."

Not a word passed Kayla's lips; she remained a silent observer, her demeanor unchanging.

Liam picked up the phone from the floor and unlocked the screen. The blood drained from his face as he stared at the display. The screen was filled with photo after photo-he and Tricia, tangled together in bed,their compromising position splashed across entertainment headlines. The bold caption screamed, "Liam Graham Caught in Affair, Betraying His Wife!"

Every image was clear as day, capturing their rumpled clothes and the intimacy of their embrace for the world to see.

Color drained from Liam's faceas he absorbed the photos on the phone. Rage simmered in his eyes when he whipped his head toward Kayla. Voice sharp and trembling, he hissed, "You set me up, didn't you? You planted someone at the hotel to catch me in the act!"

A slow, knowing smile crept across Kayla's lips as she addressed Johnny instead. "You heard him. He just confessed."

Explosive fury overtook Johnny. He snatched up his cane and lashed out, striking Liam's back before Janiya threw herself in the way and shielded her son from further blows.

Struggling for breath, Johnny spat, "How many warnings have I given you? Never do anything to disgrace the Graham name! Did you even listen?"

Amid Johnny's outburst, Kayla's heart filled with scorn. The hypocrisy was almost laughable. She knew all too well that Johnny had always been aware of Liam's affair-he'd simply told her to endure it for the family's image. But now, with the whole world watching, he was ready to play the role of the indignant patriarch.

While Kayla stood in silent contempt, a new presence appeared in the doorway.

Jeremy walked in, having gotten word of the scandal himself. The moment he entered, he caught the charged energy in the room.

Janiya wasted no time rushing to him, desperation etched on her face. "Jeremy, you have to help Liam! The stories on the internet-they're all lies. Somebody is out to destroy him!"

An unreadable look passed over Jeremy's face as he glanced at Kayla. His reply came out crisp and unsympathetic. "The proof is everywhere. Trying to bury this now would only make things worse." Still, Janiya insisted, "Please! If you don't do something, his future is finished!"
Kayla stepped forward, her words slicing through the room."1fyou understood how much damage this would cause, why let him get away with it in the first place? Now you want to play the victim? That's rich."

Outrage twisted Janiya's features as she spun on Kayla. "How dare you! If Liam's name is dragged through the mud, yours is too. What could you possibly gain from this?"

A short, cold laugh escaped Kayla. "His lack of self-control is not my burden. Since he's crossed the line,I want only one thing-a divorce."

Those words hit like a slap. Liam stormed toward Kayla, jabbing a finger inches from her face."So that's it?This is all just a ploy for divorce? Forget it. I won't let you go that easily!"

Kayla faced him without a hint of fear. "Your choices are no longer yours alone. The whole city knows your scandals now. If you're hoping to save face, I'd suggest you grant the divorce quietly. Refuse, and I'll see to it your reputation never recovers."

Off to the side, Jeremy settled comfortably into an armchair, watching the chaos unfold.

He had learned about Liam's affair trending online while working at the company. Sensing Kayla's fingerprints all over the uproar, he hadn't hesitated to show up for tonight's family showdown.

Muscles tensed, Liam's hands balled into fists, fury twisting his features. "Don't push your luck, Kayla!"

Kayla replied, "You're the only one doing any pushing."

Her attention flicked to his slowly rising hand, but her cold, challenging smile didn't waver. Closing the distance between them, she fixed him with a gaze sharp enough to draw blood. "Thinking of hitting me? Go on, Liam. All that will do is give me one more charge-domestic violence."
###Chapter 98 Asking Jeremy For Help


Johnny slammed his hand against the table, the sharp sound cutting through the chaos as he coughed and steadied his voice. "Enough. Liam, have that trending topic removed. Right now."

Liam hesitated, shifting uncomfortably as his gaze flicked toward Jeremy, who watched the scene unfold with an infuriating smirk.

Shoulders tense, Liam muttered, "It's already gone viral-hundreds of thousands of shares. Uncle Jeremy,l can't do this alone. I need your help to take it down."

Jeremy didn't answer. He reclined in his chair, legs crossed, toying with his ring as if the crisis didn't concern him in the slightest. His face was unreadable, eyes sharp and distant.

Janiya cut in, "Jeremy, you could make this disappear with a single call. Every minute it stays up, the Graham name takes another hit."

Johnny turned to Jeremy, knowing he was the only one powerful enough to bury the story. For a moment,the room held its breath.

Jeremy finally raised his cold gaze to meet Johnny's. His words came out measured and deadly. "Back then,you cheated on my mom. The paparazzi caught you red-handed. I remember-you didn't even try to stop the story. You used it-flaunted your mistress, paid for puff pieces about your 'great love.' My mom never recovered. That scandal destroyed her."

The words landed like a blow, and Johnny's face twisted in shame as old wounds split open in front of everyone.

Kayla, watching the exchange, felt a chill snake up her spine. She'd known Johnny had a hand in Jeremy's mother's death, but hearing the sordid details spelled out made her stomach turn.

Driving his wife to an early grave for a mistress? That was beyond heartless.

Janiya stepped up to defend Johnny. "Jeremy, you've got the wrong idea. Dad was overwhelmed back then -he didn't mean to let things get out of hand. What happened to your mom wasn't his fault."

Jeremy's cold stare cut her off, leaving her stiff and silent.

A tense quiet filled the room before Jeremy finally glanced at Kayla. "Regardless, I support Kayla's decision to divorce."

Kayla blinked in surprise, caught off guard that Jeremy would take her side.

Jeremy sipped his coffee, eyes fixed on the cup, pretending his support was nothing noteworthy.

Janiya hurried to smooth things over. "Alright. Tomorrow, they'll go get the divorce settled. Jeremy, can you handle that trending topic now?"

Liam's face went ashen, and he blurted out, "Mom!"

Janiya silenced him with a sharp look.

Burdened with guilt, Johnny turned to Kayla, his tone gentler. "Kayla, I know things with Liam haven't been easy. You two should end this without any more trouble."

Inside, Kayla wanted to leap for joy, but she masked her excitement behind a calm, polite smile for Jeremy.

Jeremy turned away, ice in his eyes,barely acknowledging Kayla's silent thanks.

Afterward, Janiya dragged Liam back to his room and shut the door behind them.
The moment the latch clicked, Liam snapped, hurling anything within reach before turning his fury on Janiya. "You told me not to get divorced; now you're the one forcing me! Mom, what's going on with you?"

Patience wearing thin, Janiya gave his forehead a pointed tap. "Use your head for once. You had no other move today. Jeremy backed Kayla in front of everyone. If you hadn't gone along, Perennia Group would be crawling with reporters by sunrise, and you'd be their next headline. Don't say I never warned you."

Shoulders slumped, Liam sank into the chair, irritation spreading across his face.

Janiya eyed him with a scornfuI tilt of her head. "I told you-if you wanted to keep using Kayla's social circle,you should've stayed away from Tricia. But you couldn't help yourself, could you?" Liam opened his mouth to argue but clamped it shut, knowing he'd fallen for Tricia's charm.
Standing by the window, arms folded and lips twisting into a sly smile, Janiya added, "Kayla isn't walking away from this marriage just yet. The court won't grant it so soon. Anything could happen in that time."

A heavy shadow crossed Liam's face as Janiya's words sank in.

Meanwhile, Kayla stepped out of the house with a lightness in her stride, heart fluttering at the prospect of freedom.

A voice like ice slíced through her giddiness. "You seem pleased. No plans to party tonight?"

She froze, her smile faltering as she turned. "Thank you for helping me."

Jeremy sauntered closer, hands tucked in his pockets, eyes assessing her. "Nicely played. You knew my father's weak spot was his precious reputation. Stir up the press and corner Janiya and Liam into agreeing to the divorce."

Kayla lifted her gaze, feigning wide-eyed innocence. "That's not it. Liam started this mess. I just defended myself."

Truth was, she'd never intended to force Johnny's hand so brutally. But when Liam went after her mother's grave, she couldn't hold back.

Jeremy's voice softened, though his gaze remained sharp. "Getting that story trending wasn't luck. You need connections to pull strings like that. Funny thing is, you're supposed to be friendless here in Trark.Guess you're more resourceful than you let on."

Kayla's pulse quickened. She let out a nervous laugh and shrugged innocently. "I don't know what you mean."

Jeremy's lips curled in a knowing smirk as he turned to his car."Want a ride?"
###Chapter 99 You've Got A Month To Think Things Over


Kayla stepped into Jeremy's car once more, her nerves still present but not as intense as before.

The drive passed in silence, neither of them speaking until they pulled up in front of her apartment.

Just as she reached for the door handle, her phone slipped from her grasp, landing by Jeremy's feet. She leaned over to retrieve it, and her head brushed awkwardly against his leg.

Jeremy stiffened instantly, and Kayla's face burned with embarrassment. She looked up, flustered."1"m sorry!"

With deliberate slowness, Jeremy took her chin in his hand. His gaze was unreadable, his voice low. "Trying to seduce me now?"

Color rushed to her cheeks. "No! It's not like that. My phone just..."

He picked up the phone and handed it to her. "Do that again, and you'll regret it."

Kayla snatched it from his hand, but in her haste, her arm tugged at his jacket, pulling him forward unexpectedly.

He stumbled into her, his body pressing hers firmly against the seat.

"Mr. Graham, we've arrived," the driver announced, glancing back, freezing at the sight of their uncomfortable position.

Kayla's breath caught in her throat as.she clutched Jeremy's collar. Their eyes met, charged with tension and lingering confusion.

"Whose car is blocking the road?"

A middle-aged woman stormed up behind the car, eyes narrowed.

Kayla shoved Jeremy away and leapt from the car, dashing into the building like she couldn't get away fast enough.

"That girl's in a real hurry," the woman muttered, approaching the vehicle. She caught Jeremy's icy stare and swallowed hard. Flashing an awkward smile, she asked, "You single, handsome?"

Jeremy rolled the window up without sparing her a glance. "Drive," he told the driver flatly.

The car took off in a rush.

The woman he left behind muttered under her breath, "These young men nowadays-no manners at all."

Back at her apartment, Kayla still felt shaken. She took a shower to calm her nerves, popped a prenatal vitamin, then curled up in bed with a parenting guide in hand.

But she couldn't concentrate-her thoughts were all over the place. With a sigh of frustration, she flung the book away.

Her thoughts circled around Jeremy-every interaction they had. She'd planned to keep him at a distance,but somehow, they kept drawing closer, and that closeness made her restless, like she was bracing for something she couldn't name.

She realized she needed to leave the city-and quickly. She couldn't afford to wait any longer.

Having made up her mind, Kayla switched off the lights and settled into bed.

By morning, she was dressed and out the door right after breakfast.

She arrived at the courthouse just as the doors were opening, becoming the first person to file for divorce that day.Liam arrived moments later, punctual as always.

Dressed in a crisp white tweed suit, her makeup flawless and refined, Kayla sat poised on a bench, waiting in composed silence.

As Liam walked in, his gaze locked on her. For a second, admiration flashed in his eyes. He started walking over to speak.

Without sparing him a glance, Kayla rose and headed for the divorce registration desk. Liam trailed behind, his voice lowered. "Are you really sure this is the end?"
She turned, her eyes like ice.-"Ifyour public image means anything to you, sit down and keep quiet."

The night before, Jeremy had the trending story wiped out in record time. But Janiya and Liam understood-if they dared to back out,he could make it explode across every headline in an instant.

Liam dropped into a chair, his face tense and pale.

The clerk glanced between them and asked, "So, you're filing on mutual grounds?"

"Yes," Kayla answered without hesitation.

"Any disagreement on property division?"

Kayla paused. Other than reclaiming the Cooper Group, she had no interest in anything else Liam owned.Her agreement with Archie was nearing its end-soon, the company would be hers again.

"No disagreements," Liam said. "I'll hand over some of my properties and cars."

Kayla smirked. Those suburban fixer-uppers and beat-up cars of Liam's? Barely worth pocket change.

The clerk nodded and passed them the documents to sign. "Everything's in motion. Just a reminder-there's a thirty-day grace period. Either of you can withdraw the application within that time. Any objections?"

Kayla felt a flicker of annoyance at the reminder, but she brushed it aside. Thirty days would pass quickly.Once done, she'd be officially free.

"No objections," she said flatly.

"Very well," the clerk replied.

Outside,Liam caught up with her, his tone laced with smugness. "You've got a month to think things over. If you change your mind, you know where to find me."

Kayla stopped, folded her arms, and turned to face him with a sly smile.11Amonth? That's nothing.And while we're at it, remember that cemetery project you've been working on? I tipped off your competitors. They're most likely scheming behind your back already."

Liam's expression twisted. "What the hell are you trying to pull?"

With a knowing smile, Kayla flagged down a cab and stepped inside, leaving without a word.

Liam's phone buzzed. His assistant's voice came through, urgent.′′Sir1, the cemetery project's been exposed. Competitors bribed the landowners. If we go through with the sale, they'll hit Perennia Group with a breach of contract lawsuit-this could cost us over a hundred million!"

Seething with rage, Liam hurled his phone to the ground, shattering it. "This is unbelievable!"
###Chapter 100 I'm Feeling A Bit Off Today


On the fourth floor of Treasure Mall, Zoe basked in the spotlight as salesgirls in the luxury jewelry boutique circled her, their voices honeyed with praise. "Miss, this set looks incredible on you-like you walked straight out of a palace. No one else could pull it off."

Soaking up every word, Zoe gazed at her reflection, the diamond necklace glinting beneath the showroom lights."You think so?"

"Absolutely. You could be a cover model for any high-end magazine. This collection was made for you."

For a moment, Zoe felt weightless, buoyed by admiration and the soft sparkle draped around her neck.Glancing down, she caught the price tag-one million, neatly printed. Once, that kind of money would've sent her running for the door. But those days were over.

With a flourish, she produced a gold card and laid it on the counter,the gesture catching the light-and every salesgirl's wide-eyed attention. In Trark, only the elite carried a card like that.

Lifting her chin, Zoe declared, "I'll take it."

Payment handled, she strode from the store, heels clicking with confidence, her spirits soaring.

"Thank you for shopping with us, Ms. Cooper! We hope to see you again soon!" The salesgirls bowed in perfect sync, voices sweet and professional.

As Zoe approached the elevator, a woman in a baseball cap and mask barreled past, ramming her shoulder hard enough to make Zoe wobble dangerously on her stilettos.

She almost caught herself against a marble pillar, fury flashing in her eyes. "Hey! Watch it!"

The woman slowed, yanking her mask down just enough to reveal a familiar, sour expression-Tricia.

Zoe's lip curled as she spotted Tricia. "Well, well. Liam's mistress. You must be lost-places like this are out of your league." Tricia's brow twitched, but she kept her tone steady. "I need a word with you."

"You think I've got time for trash talk? Keep dreaming." Zoe turned on her heel, ready to walk away.

"Suppose I told you Kayla's after Jeremy-would that get your attention?" Tricia asked.

Zoe spun around, her eyes flashing with fury. "Don't make up stories! That bitch wouldn't dare!"

A slow, taunting smile spread across Tricia's lips. "You really think Jeremy cares about you? To himn,you're just another pretty thing he can throw money at. Meanwhile, Newton Group's been playing nice with North Investment. Archie keeps pushing Kayla to handle the deals-just her and Jeremy, getting cozier every time.How long before she climbs right into his bed?"

Rage snapped in Zoe's voice. "She's not even close to being good enough for him!"

Tricia shrugged, feigning indifference. "Don't take my word for it-look into it yourself. I hate Kayla just as much as you do. Why not team up? Get her out of the picture for good."

Zoe didn't answer. She stared at Tricia in silence, her expression hard to read, then turned sharply and marched away.

Tricia's smirk lingered as she watched Zoe retreat, convinced she'd planted the seed.

Meanwhile, at the sanatorium, Kayla waited in the hallway while Marsha went through physical therapy,nurses bustling around her.

She watched Marsha's radiant smile and felt a tangle of emotions.

She still had a month left before the divorce from Liam would be finalized, and the looming deadline set her nerves on edge. She couldn't afford any missteps now.

Once the divorce was done, she could finally take Marsha and leave Trark behind for good.

Pulling out her phone, Kayla quickly dialed Archie.

He answered after several rings, sounding as busy as ever. "Kayla? Isn't today your day off? What's going on?"Lowering her voice, Kayla replied, "Mr. Newton, our one-month agreement is almost over."

Archie let out a short laugh. "Relax, Kayla. I'Il return Cooper Group to you, just ike I promised. My assistant's already preparing the paperwork. Still, I've got to ask-are you sure you don't want to stay? The pay's pretty tempting."

Kayla answered, "No, thank you. We agreed on one month."

"Fair enough. I respect that," Archie responded, ending the call without protest.

Just as Kayla slipped her phone away and turned to rejoin Marsha, her screen lit up with a new message.
It was from Jeremy's assistant, reminding her that tomorrow she'd need to deliver the project files to Jeremy.Since he wvas out of town for the next couple of days, she'd have to meet him at a different location.

Kayla's brow knit as she glanced at the address on her phone, unease flickering across her face.

She started tapping out a message to Jeremy's assistant, determined to postpone the meeting.

"Kayla, come here for a second!" Marsha's voice rang out from down the hall.

Sliding her phone into her pocket, Kayla hurried over with a quick. "Coming!"

The following morning, once she settled into her office, the memory hit-she'd completely forgotten to follow up with Jeremy's assistant after her evening with Marsha.

Her meeting was scheduled at a resort more than sixty miles outside the city, practically demanding an overnight stay.

Kayla sat at her desk, deep in thought, barely noticing as her coworker Lily Lyons wandered over.

Lily knocked her knuckles lightly on Kayla's desk and called out, "You seem miles away, Kayla. What's caught your mind? Mr. Newton says our team crushed it on the last round of projects, so he's buying everyone afternoon coffee."

Offering a faint smile, Kayla responded, "I don't think l'Il be able to join you guys."

Lily looked ather, eyebrows raised."Why not?"	  Scooping up a hefty stack of documents, Kayla let out a sigh."I've got a business trip later. Total headache."

Lily's eyes danced with curiosity as she eyed the paperwork. "Wait, is this for the North Investment deal?Rumor has it you're almost ready to close."

Kayla caught the spark in Lily's eyes and a new idea took shape. Grasping Lily's hand, she leaned in and whispered, "Lily, I'm feeling a bit off today. What do you say you handle this trip for me?"
