
###Chapter 1 Welcome Home
"You've weathered countless storms over the years.Welcome home,Arabella."


At the celebratory dinner, a young man in a perfectly tailored suit found himself unwilling to look away from Arabella Stanley.


She possessed an otherworldly beauty, her sharp features sculpted with precision and wrapped in an aura of cool detachment. Her piercing eyes revealed nothing of her inner thoughts, and when she spoke, her voice carried the same arctic chill. "I'm leaving now."


Joshua Willis, the young man, seized the moment without hesitation. "Allow me to drive you home."


Arabella offered no resistance.



The car glided through the night. The city lights blurred past as Joshua stole alances at her
profile. "When do you plan to return to the company? Our empire continues to flourish."


Their partnership had begun years ago through a chance project, and Joshua had witnessed Arabella's brilliance firsthand. He had persuaded her to join forces, and together they had forged a company that now dominated the entire industry.


Arabella maintained her measured tone. "I'll decide when the time feels right. For now, I simply want to reach home."


"Understood completely. You must be eager to reunite with Daisy. She's undoubtedly thriving.I've been directing all the premium projects to your aunt's husband throughout these years."Joshua's grin widened as he angled for recognition.


Arabella and her twin sister Daisy Stanley had lost their parents at the tender age of six, and their aunt Meagan Tucker had stepped in to care for them both.
Arabella acknowledged him with a subtle nod. "I appreciate that."


Her delicate fingers found the cherry blossom pendant resting against her throat, clicking it open to reveal a treasured photograph of herself and Daisy.


Arabella's expression remained stoic in the image, but Daisy's smile blazed with pure joy.


Studying her sister's radiant face, Arabella felt an unfamiliar warmth soften her features.



After their parents' tragic death, Arabella and Daisy had become each other's entire world.Daisy had always been their family's ray of sunshine, illuminating every room she entered.


At twelve, Arabella had been handpicked by the government for a classified operation that consumed seven years of her life. Now that the mission had concluded, she could finally return to Daisy.


She had forwarded nearly every government
paycheck to her sister, ensuring Daisy lived in comfort and security.


Joshua's eyes widened in amazement as he witnessed Arabella's smile.



The legendary ice queen was actually smiling?


His curiosity about Arabella's sister intensified dramatically.



The car approached an upscale residential community, where each house boasted its own meticulously maintained garden.


The vehicle glided to a stop in front of a house.



This was the home Arabella's parents had bequeathed to them, now shared between Meagan and Daisy.


The estate glowed with warm light, alive with the sound of cheerful laughter.



Daisy seemed to be flourishing beautifully.


With that thought in mind, Arabella preserved
her gentle smile as she crossed into the front yard.


A weathered doghouse sat in the corner of the property.


Someone knelt beside it in the shadows.



Through the dim evening light, Arabella couldn't distinguish the person's features, but she watched them scooping food directly from the bowl placed on the ground.


Why would someone be eating beside the doghouse?


Concern creased her brow as Arabella approached cautiously.



The figure appeared startled and scrambled quickly into the doghouse.


Arabella's bewilderment deepened. Then a soft,trembling voice drifted from within the shelter."Please don't strike me again. I won't make any mistakes. I'll be so much more careful..."
That voice belonged to Daisy.


Arabella's heart shattered instantly. She lunged forward, pulling the figure from the doghouse.Even in the pale moonlight, she recognized her beloved sister immediately.


Daisy stared back, her eyes swimming with disbelief. "You..." she breathed, as though she feared her mind was playing cruel tricks on her.


"Daisy, is that truly you?" Arabella's voice trembled with disbelief.


When Daisy nodded weakly, a glacial fury erupted within Arabella, her eyes igniting with volcanic rage.


"Bella..." Daisy whispered, still trapped in shock."You've actually come back?"


The moment felt impossibly surrealto Daisy,like a vision conjured from desperate longing.



Arabella, sensing something terribly wrong,reached out to touch Daisy's forehead. Her skin
burned with fever. Before Arabella could process this discovery, Daisy crumpled into her arms like a broken doll.


Arabella cradled her sister, whose body felt heartbreakingly frail and ice-cold despite the raging fever consuming her.


Arabella's heart crystallized into something harder than diamond.


The front door of the house suddenly burst open with violent force.


"Daisy, you worthless creature! It's been several minutes, and you're still not finished eating? Get inside immediately and wash those dishes!"Meagan's voice sliced through the night air like a blade.


Arabella pivoted slowly, her predatory gaze locking onto her target.


Meagan had transformed dramatically over the years. Once haggard and perpetually exhausted, she now radiated wealth and
privilege, adorned in an expensive designer coat and gleaming jewelry that caught the porch light, presenting herself as the very embodiment of refined elegance.


Meagan's blood turned to ice under Arabella's lethal stare. "You... Arabella? When did you arrive?"


"What have you done to her?" Arabella advanced with calculated steps, her voice dropping to a menacing whisper.


Meagan instinctively retreated, unsettled by the predatory intensity burning in Arabella's eyes.But she quickly rallied her confidence,reminding herself that Arabella was still just a young woman.


She twisted her lips into a cruel sneer. "Daisy shattered a dish, so l administered appropriate punishment. You've been absent for years. Do you possess any understanding of how challenging life has been here? I never allowed her to starve or sleep without shelter. If you
weren't my brother's daughters, I wouldn't have wasted my time with either of you."


In one fluid motion, Arabella's hand shot out and seized Meagan by the throat, her expression transforming into something carved from arctic stone. Meagan gasped desperately,clawing at Arabella's iron grip. "Let... me... gO..."


"This is my house," Arabella declared, her voice carrying the finality of a death sentence, her eyes radiating lethal intent. "You forced Daisy to perform menial labor. You made her sleep in that doghouse like an animal. You possess remarkable audacity, Meagan."


In the warm light streaming from the house,Arabella finally saw what Daisy had been consuming. It was the leftover food.


Holding her sister, who felt as weightless as a dying bird and appeared ghostly pale and utterly drained, Arabella felt her heart shatter into countless pieces.
Her precious sister had endured this nightmare!


"Meagan," Arabella said, her voice saturated with deadly promise, "when you moved into our home,you swore a sacred oath that you would care for Daisy."


Meagan bristled at Arabella's bold use of her first name, the disrespect cutting deep.



But she shrank backward when she witnessed the murderous gleam dancing in Arabella's eyes.


Arabella had always been fundamentally different from other children. She was cold and fearlessly bold. When Arabella had lived here,Meagan had performed the role of a dutiful aunt, though barely meeting even the lowest standards.


But the moment Arabella departed,Meagan had seized absolute control, systematically crushing the gentle-spirited Daisy beneath her cruel authority.
She had never imagined Arabella would return to witness her crimes.


"I did take care of Daisy! She made a mistake,so I disciplined her accordingly. What's so terrible about that?" Meagan's words died in her throat as Arabella's grip tightened mercilessly,making her feel as though death itself was reaching for her soul.


"Arabella?" The violent commotion finally drew the attention of the people inside. Meagan's husband and daughter noticed the deadly confrontation unfolding at their door.


Through the wide open front door, Arabella observed them living luxuriously in a spacious and magnificently decorated villa, with a table overflowing with exquisite delicacies. The people inside wore expensive clothing that spoke of comfort and abundance.


Meanwhile, Daisy had been sleeping in a doghouse, consuming leftovers. Arabella's eyes burned with unshed tears as the devastating
truth crashed over her with overwhelming force.
###Chapter 2 Can You Check Who Made The Payment
Khloe Tucker was fuming. "Let go of my mom,Arabella! Back then, she offered to take care of you and Daisy out of kindness. Is that how you repay her? You show up after disappearing for years, acting like you're some kind of hero?What, did you run off, get pregnant, and have a kid or something? What a joke!"


Khloe threw Arabella a nasty glare, but deep down, she actually hoped Arabella might stay.Having her back would mean more help around the house.



But Arabella's eyes had already gone cold.Without saying a word, she entered the house and kicked the dining table hard. Dishes flew everywhere, crashing onto the floor anc shattering into pieces.
Before anyone could react, Arabella grabbed two vases and hurled them straight at Khloe and her father. They hit them squarely, and blood started trickling down their faces as they screamed in shock.


Her voice was ice. "You've got one day. Get out of my house." Without waiting for a reply, she stormed out with Daisy in her arms. She flagged down the first taxi she saw and rushed her sister straight to a hospital.


Back at the villa, chaos broke out.



"Mom! That psycho actually attacked me!"Khloe sobbed, staring at the scratches on her face in the mirror. "What if I'm left with scars?"



Meagan's fury boiled over. "She's gotten way too bold after all these years! If she shows her face again, she won't be so lucky. We're not nobodies anymore. We've joined hands with Norman Group.There's no way she can stand aqainst us!"
She gave Khloe a comforting pat. "Don't worry honey. I'm taking you to a hospital right now."


***




At the hospital, the doctor examined Daisy and frowned. "Her leg's been broken for a while, and she's covered in bruises. Some of her teeth are missing too. What kind of sister lets this happen?"


Arabella's voice was low. "It's my fault."



Her bangs fell over her eyes, hiding whatever she was feeling inside.


The doctor, noticing how quiet she was, spoke gently. "I've done what I could for now. But if someone's been hurting you two, you need to report it. Keeping quiet won't fix anything."


Arabella gave a small nod and moved to stand beside Daisy's hospital bed.


Daisy, now nineteen, looked heartbreakingly fragile. Her thin frame looked like it couldn't
support itself, and her wrists seemed more like twigs than limbs.


Her short hair was uneven, dry, and choppy, like someone had taken scissors to it without a second thought.



Arabella gently lifted the blanket, and her heart dropped.


Daisy's skin told a horrifying story. Old whip marks crisscrossed her legs, and dark burn spots marred her arms. Each scar screamed of cruelty. Arabella's breath caught, and before she could stop them, tears rolled down her cheeks.


"Bella..." Daisy's voice was barely a whisper.



Arabella immediately reached for her hand. "I'm here," she said softly.



"I... missed you," Daisy murmured, her voice hoarse.


Arabella clutched her hand like a lifeline. "|
missed you too. I thought if I worked hard,could give you a better life. But I was wrong.I never should've left you alone. I swear, I'm not going anywhere again."


The warmth in Arabella's voice seemed to melt Daisy's tension. Slowly, her expression softened.


After making sure Daisy was settled, Arabella went to sort out the payment.


"The charges have already been covered," the nurse said with a kind smile.


Arabella blinked. "What? WVho paid?"



Joshua crossed her mind, but she quickly dismissed the thought. There was no way he knew about this yet.


"Can you check who made the payment?" she asked.


The nurse gave an apologetic shake of the head."Sorry, that information's private. Maybe
a family member helped out?"


At the word family, Arabella's face turned to stone. She gave a short nod and walked off without another word. If someone had helped,she was going to find out who.


Meanwhile, down the corridor, Meagan strolled beside her daughter, Khloe, who was fresh out of the emergency room with her face patched up.


"I'm not letting Arabella walk away from this,"Khloe snarled, bitterness burning in her voice.



"Calm down," Meagan said sharply. "You'll reopen your stitches if you keep flaring up like this. Be more like your sister-grace under pressure."


That seemed to cheer Khloe up. A smug smile tugged at her lips. "As long as my sister keeps shining, that's all that matters. She's the youngest dancer in the Griridge Troupe now.Daisy really thought she could outshine her?
rL-...--.-.700

She was delusional. That broken leg was karma,if you ask me. And if my sister finds out how Arabella treated me-oh, she'll tear her apart."


"She's got a big show coming up," Meagan reminded her. "Let's not distract her. One step at a time."


She tapped Khloe's nose lightly, but then her expression stiffened as she spotted Arabella ahead.


Khloe saw Arabella too, and just the sight of her brought back the sting of humiliation. Her rage boiled over.


Without thinking, she grabbed her studded handbag and swung it with all her strength toward Arabella's back.


Arabella's instincts kicked in. Just as she turned around, a tall man came into view. With quick reflexes and strong arms, he grabbed the bag mid-air by its strap, stopping it like it was nothing.
The sudden pull made Khloe lose her balance,and with a startled scream, she fell to the floor.
###Chapter 3 Grab Your Things And Come With Me
"Khloe!" Meagan hurried to her daughter's side,helping her up while shooting a vicious glare at the man who had shown up out of nowhere."Who the hell are you? Arabella's new guy or what?"


The man didn't bother responding. His sharp eyes gave nothing away, cold and unreadable,like the still, deep sea that hid its danger.


Then he began walking toward Meagan, each step loud and heavy on the hospital floor.



Meagan instinctively took a step back. Her chest tightened, making it hard to breathe.


Deep down, something told her this man wasn't just any stranger-he was trouble.


Trying to mask her unease, she snapped,
"Arabella, you'd better think twice before crossing us again. You and your sister were lucky we let you stay at all! If you ever want back in, come crawling, and maybe we'll consider it."


Yanking Khloe's arm, Meagan stormed off.



Arabella stood silently, watching them go. Let them stay? That house was legally Daisy's and hers.


She glanced at the man and caught sight of a pistol, just for a second, before it disappeared beneath his jacket. Her eyes narrowed slightly.


Who was this guy?



He turned and looked directly at her. Arabella finally saw his face-handsome as hell, rough around the edges, and those icy eyes didn't blink or soften for anyone.



He gave off a vibe that screamed danger-Arabella had never felt anything like it.
No surprise Meagan bolted-anyone with sense would have.


"Arabella Stanley," he said. His tone was calm and low, but there was a chill in it that made her skin prickle.


Arabella glanced him over. "You're the one who paid for my sister, right?"


He gave a faint nod. "You're quick. Grab your things and come with me."


Arabella's brows drew together. "Excuse me?"



Who even was this guy, showing up with mystery and attitude?


Before things got tenser, another man stepped in-less intimidating but equally serious. "Miss Stanley, allow me to explain. This is Mr. Asher Gordon. His father and your dad served together in the military. Before his father passed away,he asked Mr. Gordon to watch over your family. Mr. Gordon only recently returned from service and has been trying to track you down
since."


That explained the military presence, the icy calm... the way he moved like someone trained for war.


Arabella studied Asher again. He didn't seem threatening now, but just closed off, like someone with a wall too thick to climb over.


She stayed calm. "You got anything to back that up? Anyone can say that."


Asher reached into his pocket and pulled out a weathered photo.


It showed two men in dusty uniforms-one was definitely her father. The other looked a lot like him.


She stared at it for a long moment before replying, "I'll think about it."


"Fair. Let's exchange numbers," Asher replied without any small talk.



Arabella added his contact. His WhatsApp
display was just a solid black box.


Funny enough, hers was the same.


A strange little coincidence, she thought.


Then the assistant added her as well. "Dominick Powell,Mr. Gordon's right hand. Reach out if you need help with anything, anytime."


Arabella gave a nod. "Got it."


With that, the two men walked off, and Arabella made her way back to Daisy's room.


Shortly after, two silent, suited bodyguards appeared at the door-they were clearly sent by Asher.


Arabella didn't ask questions. She got to work helping Daisy clean up-changing her into fresh clothes and gently washing her hair, trying to fix its brittle, uneven mess.


But when she saw the scars and cigarette burns covering Daisy's body, her eyes welled up again.
Holding back her tears, she carefully rubbed her homemade cream onto the wounds. Then,without wasting a second, she opened her laptop.


She had to find out what had happened to Daisy while she was gone, so she hacked into the villa's security system.


Sadly, what she saw made her sick to her stomach.


It wasn't long after Arabella left that Daisy was thrown out of her own bedroom and made to sleep in a doghouse.


The cheerful, lively sister Arabella remembered didn't smile anymore.


She saw footage of Daisy juggling multiple part-time jobs, only to get harassed and pushed around.


Even so, she kept working hard and made it into one of the top universities. But during her very first semester, she ended up with a broken leg.
She was studying dance, and just like that,the injury shattered everything she had dreamed of.


The pieces fell into place too easily. Khloe's sister, Elissa Tucker, was in the same class.Arabella's gut told her that leg injury hadn't been some fluke.


After that, Daisy barely left the house. She was treated like hired help, scrubbing floors, cooking meals, and still sleeping out in that damn doghouse.


Yet every time Daisy texted her, it was the same lie. "I'm doing fine. Don't worry about me. You just take care of yourself."


Arabella's vision blurred.



While her sister was being broken piece by piece, their aunt's family was thriving. Their business had taken off, thanks to a lucrative deal with the Vanguard Group.


Khloe, a middle school dropout, was suddenly a digital influencer. Elissa was famous and
popular in the college. Meagan was rubbing shoulders with high-society ladies, and her husband had become some corporate hotshot.


Arabella clenched her jaw and slammed her fist against the table. She didn't even feel the sting.



Every bit of success she had worked for... had only served to feed that vile family's greed.


And the one person she had sworn to protect had suffered in silence the entire time.
###Chapter 4 This Revenge Is Mine To Carry Out
Arabella took a slow breath, wiped the tears from her cheeks, and her eyes turned cold, like a fire had been snuffed out and replaced with ice. Her fingers gripped her phone tightly/as she made a call. "That major project-it hasn't been handed over to the Tucker Group yet, right?Cancel it. Completely." Her voice was calm but firm. "And get to the Griridge Hospital. Now."


On the other end, Joshua sounded startled."Arabella? What's going on?"


"You'll see when you get here. Bring a few things with you."


True to form, Joshua didn't waste time. Less than half an hour later, he rushed into the hospital, and the moment his eyes landed on the girl in the hospital bed, he froze like a
statue. She looked so much like Arabella-same face,but all color drained, bruised, battered, her body wrecked like it had been thrown away and forgotten.


Joshua's fists clenched. "Who did this? Tell me who it was. I'll make them pay, I swear it!"


That was the sisterof a preeminent figure...and they treated her like this?


Arabella didn't flinch. "I'll handle it myself.Slowly," she muttered, picking up a pair of scissors from the table.


Before Joshua could react, the scissors had already cut through her long, silky hair. The strands dropped to the floor in silence.


He stared, stunned. "Arabella... you're not actually..."


"I am," she said. "This revenge is mine to carry out."


Joshua swallowe d  hard, goosebumps rising on
his arms.


The way she said it-it was clear. Hell was coming for someone.


Arabella glanced at him. "Also, what do you know about the Gordons?"


"The Gordon family?" He immediately straightened. "They're legendary. Way beyond the top elite families. Super wealthy, but incredibly discreet. I've only ever worked with the right-hand man of their current CEO."


"You mean Dominick Powell?" Arabella asked casually.


Joshua's jaw dropped. "Wait, you know Dominick? Don't tell me... are you saying the Gordons were involved in what happened to Daisy?"


Arabella gave him a blank stare before calmly explaining Asher's connection and what he had said earlier. Joshua slapped his thigh, clearly overwhelmed. "Asher Gordon? If it's really him,
then yeah, no one's faking that. He leads the family. Rumor has it he's ex-special forces, quiet as a ghost, but deadly. If someone crosses him,they don't get a second chance."


Arabella didn't react. She just stared at the floor, her thoughts turning in circles.


Then she spoke, steady and cold. "You should head out now. Also... sell my villa."


Joshua hesitated. "That place... that's your parents' home. Are you sure?"


Arabella looked over at Daisy's fragile frame."She was tortured in that house. There's no comfort left there. Just get rid of it."


Her voice cracked slightly. "And if possible, find a buyer who's impossible to deal with."


Joshua gave her a long look, then nodded."Understood. I've got a bunch of properties lined up. If you ever need a place, it's yours."


"Thanks"
She didn't look up, and Joshua, sensing she needed space, quietly slipped out the door.


Left alone, Arabella gently held Daisy's hand and murmured, "I swear, everyone who hurt you...I'll make them pay for it tenfold."


That night felt endless, and sleep didn't come.


The next morning, Arabella stood quietly outside a dance studio at Griridge University's dance department, listening through the open door.


"Elissa, things have been so dull without that pathetic girl around," someone inside snickered.


"| know, right? No one to fetch us coffee, no one to mess with. It's no fun without a punching bag," another chimed in.


Peering through the glass window, Arabella spotted Elissa in the middle of the dance studio.



Years ago, Elissa had been just a pale, skinny kid. Now she was dressed in a flowing white
dance outfit, all elegance and grace, like something out of a dream.


Surrounded by classmates, Elissa flashed a gentle, modest smile at the comments. "Guys,don't say that. Let's not be mean."


"You're too kind, Elissa," Joyce Lambert, her good friend, scoffed. "That girl sponged off your family for years. If it were me, l'd have thrown her out of your house on day one."


Arabella narrowed her eyes slightly.



Calling it their house? Seriously?


That place belonged to her and Daisy. Elissa and her family were the ones living off of them.


Elissa tilted her head, her voice syrupy sweet."She's my cousin, after all. Her parents passed away. If we didn't take her in, she would've had nowhere to go."


Her fake compassion earned gasps of admiration from the crowd.
What a generous soul, they all seemed to think.



The loud chatter in the dance studio instantly stopped the moment Arabella walked in.



"Daisy?" Joyce blinked in surprise.



She stared at Arabella, stunned. She looked the same, but... something about her felt different now.
###Chapter 5 Got Yourself A Suyai Daddy
The dance studio fell silent, as if someone had hit pause. Every single eye was locked on Arabella, but she acted like she didn't see a thing and confidently made her way to the back,where she began stretching like it was just another day.


Joyce's jaw clenched. "Daisy, you've got some nerve showing up out of nowhere like this!"Joyce barked, marching over and swinging a sharp kick at her. "Just because we've gone easy on you doesn't mean you're not taking orders from us!"


But Arabella moved with ease, dodging the kick without breaking a sweat. Joyce lost her balance and hit the floor face-first with a loud,painful thud.
"You dodged me?" Joyce screeched in disbelief. Her face turned red with fury as she raised her hand to slap Arabella. But just like before, Arabella slipped out of reach like a shadow. Joyce's swing caught nothing but air,and she stumbled forward, grabbing her lower back with a wince. "Damn it!"


"My bad," Arabella said gently, her voice almost too soft to catch.


Joyce wanted to explode, but something about Arabella's calmness made her hesitate. She didn't dare swing again. Instead, she snapped,"What are you just standing there for? Get over here and help us stretch already!"


"So, Daisy's really back," she thought smugly."Still the same pathetic errand girl."



Arabella's gaze briefly darkened, but she gave a polite nod like an obedient student.


She knelt beside Joyce and began helping her with leg stretches. Joyce smirked. "You look
even sadder than before. Honestly, it's pathetic."


But then, a painful scream cut through the air.


Joyce's leg jolted, and she broke into a cold sweat, grabbing her thigh. "My leg... what the hell? Did you snap my leg?"


The class crowded around her in a frenzy.


"Is she alright? Someone call for help!"



"Look, the teacher just walked in!"


Their panic was cut short as the teacher entered the room.



Arabella still had Joyce's leg in her hands.Calmly, almost casually, she gave it a subtle twist.


"Ah!" Joyce screamed even louder, nearly in tears from the pain.


"What's going on in here?" The teacher frowned,scanning the chaos.
"My leg! It feels broken... I can't-" Joyce wailed, then blinked in confusion. Just seconds later, she could move it again. "Wait...what?"


"You look fine to me." The teacher shot a look at Joyce-one that wasn't exactly sympathetic.She had seen enough of these girls' antics over the years. "I don't care what drama you're cooking up on your own time, but today's important. The Griridge Troupe selection is happening. The dean and senior faculty will be here shortly, so l expect everyone to act like professionals."


"I swear, I..." Joyce began, trying to protest.



"That's enough." Elissa cut her off, stepping forward with an easy smile. "Let's not waste more time. Joyce, calm down."



Elissa's tone made it clear-this wasn't the time to pick fights.


Joyce had no choice but to bite her tongue and swallow her anger, though her glare at Arabella
could have burned through steel.


The teacher clapped her hands, and class began.


During the last twenty minutes, a few other teachers showed up to observe.



By the time class ended, the room was filled with a mix of nervous energy and excited chatter.


"God, I really hope I get picked. Dancing alongside Elissa would be a dream come true."


"Elissa, don't forget us when you're famous!"someone teased.



Elissa gave her signature angelic smile. "Of course not. You're all my people."


Then someone dropped a name that made the entire class go silent. "They say Isabella might be watching today."


Gasps rippled through the room.
< Chapter 5 Got Yourself A Sugar Daddy

Even Elissa blinked in shock, her breath catcching.Isabella Wallace was


the icon of modern dance. Her performances were legendary, her choreography unrivaled.Just being seen by her could open doors.


"If Isabella notices me, that's it. That's my breakthrough," Elissa thought, her gaze sharpening with quiet ambition.


But then someone spoke up, disrupting the mood. "I saw Daisy dancing earlier. Honestly,she wasn't bad at all."


Joyce scoffed loud enough for the room to hear."Daisy? Please. She's pathetic. No way she'd get picked."


Turning her attention to Daisy, she said, "Hey,what are you still doing here, anyway? Go get our lunch. You remember our order,right?"


Without a word, Arabella nodded and walked off, her tall frame moving with a silent elegance despite the slump in her shoulders.
580%
<Chapter 5 Got Yourself A Sugar Daddy

"Ugh. Even the way she walks is irritating. Does she actually think she's all graceful or something? What a complete eyesore!" Joyce sneered.


By the time Joyce, Elissa, and the rest of their group showed up at the cafeteria, laughing and cracking jokes, Arabella already had their meals prepared. Her eyes quietly scanned each of them-calm, blank, giving nothing away. But in her mind, she was taking note of everything.


Joyce, whose father ran the Lambert Group,was spoiled beyond belief and filthy rich.


Next to her was Kenzie Marsh-the meek,glasses-wearing music student who practically worshipped the ground Elissa walked on.


And behind them, the two guys were followers,plain and simple. They were all muscle without a mind.



Joyce looked at the food Arabella had bought and narrowed her eyes. "Well, well. Where'd you 71.0%                        01:35
get the cash, huh? Got yourself a sugar daddy?I thought you were broke, freeloader."


Joyce kept running her mouth but still dove into the food-everyone was starving after dancing all morning.


However, midway through eating, something went terribly wrong. Joyce coughed violently,blood trickling from her lips as she clutched her throat, her eyes wide in panic. The others followed suit, gasping, hands around their necks, as if something sharp was tearing through their throats.


"It burns-what's happening?" they wheezed,struggling to speak as pain ripped through them.


Elissa stared at her in disbelief, still holding her throat. "Daisy... what did you do?"


"That little bitch's getting revenge!" Joyce screamed, losing it completely. "You think Elissa letting you tag along means we'll go easy on
you? You're dead!"



Furious, she flung her food tray at Arabella,while the two boys beside her instinctively lunged forward, ready to grab her without hesitation.
###Chapter 6 Do You Have Any Proof
The students nearby were numb to this kind of chaos.


"Alright, that's enough," Elissa said, her voice sounding gentle on the surface but hollow beneath it. She stayed comfortably seated, not bothering to step in-after all, she never did when things got ugly.


Meanwhile, Arabella, calm and collected, didn't even flinch. When the tray came flying her way,she calmly reached up and caught it in one smooth motion.


The momentum flipped the tray's course, and it slammed straight into one of the two boys'faces.


The food, laced with slivers of glass, sliced across his skin, and blood trickled down his cheek in thin, terrifying lines. "Shit! That hurts!"
he cried out.


One look at the blood was enough, and he collapsed in panic, completely out cold.



The other guy didn't back down. Snarling,he reached for Arabella's hair, yanking it hard."You think you're tough, Daisy? Huh?"


His fist flew toward her face, but Arabella caught it mid-swing like it was nothing. His expression froze. She slowly twisted his arm until his knees buckled.


"Ahhh! It hurts-stop, please! I'm sorry!" he howled,his face turning as pale as chalk.


The second she let go, he hit the floor and curled into himself, sobbing in pain.


One of the girls considered helping, but after seeing Arabella in action, she backed off without a word.


What a bunch of clowns.


Arabella stared at them, her gaze sharp and
cold, like she was looking at trash.


"Have you lost your fucking mind?" Joyce screeched, still in denial. Her hands shook as she picked up a chair and hurled it with all her strength.


Arabella shifted her weight, spun, and kicked the chair right back-slamming it into Joyce's head. Blood splattered instantly.


Elissa jumped up in horror, shrieking, "Oh my God!"



The cafeteria exploded with shouts. "She's gonna kill someone! Go find a teacher!"


"What is wrong with her? is she high or something?"


"Honestly, she's kind of a badass..."


"Shh! Don't let anyone hear you say that!"


Thirty minutes later, the university president's office was a pressure cooker.
The fight was way too intense to sweep under the rug. Daisy, Elissa, and the rest of the group were hauled in for questioning.


Joyce and the others had been bandaged up,but their egos were just as bruised. Elissa looked ready to cry, still rubbing her sore throat like it had swallowed fire. She was furious,terrified the damage was permanent.


"Call your parents," the president ordered Arabella sharply, trying to make sense of the madness."Now."


Joyce jumped in before Arabella could speak."She can't. Her parents are dead!" she sneered."She's been mooching off Elissa's family for years. No morals. No manners. Just expel her already!"


Taken aback, the president looked Arabella up and down. "So, what exactly happened?"


Joyce didn't miss a beat. "She put glass in our food. She tried to hurt us and then went berserk. She needs to face consequences!"
Arabella didn't even blink. Her voice came out calm and cold. "Do you have any proof? And while we're at it-did I even lay a finger on you first? Pretty sure your side started swinging."



"Liar!" Joyce snapped, trying to keep the panic out of her voice.


Arabella turned her gaze to the president, cool and steady. "Why don't we pull up the cafeteria security footage?"


Silence dropped like a stone. Joyce's face stiffened, and her jaw clenched tight. "We only hit her because she gave us food full of glass!She deserved it!"


Arabella tilted her head slightly. "Where's your proof that I put it there?" she asked softly."Because I have proof of something else."


She pulled out her phone and tapped the screen. A video began to play.
The footage was damning. It showed Joyce and her gang shoving a sandwich filled with glass into Daisy's mouth. As Daisy's lips bled,they laughed likeit was some sick joke.


It was raw and unforgivable. Arabella's chest tightened as she watched it, the pain as fresh as the day she found it on Daisy's phone.


Even the president's face shifted. He turned to Joyce and her friends with a sharp, icy glare.For a split second, panic flashed across their faces. Trying to smooth things over, Elissa quickly said, "Sir, yeah, Joyce went too far, and we're really sorry. But Daisy was talking trash first-Joyce just lost her temper."


Arabella raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. "Is that so? Well then, I'll just upload this little clip online and let the public decide who the real victim is."


"Absolutely not!" the president barked. "Miss Stanley, if that video gets out, it'll drag the university through the mud. Let's not blow this
out of proportion. Apologize to each other,and we'll call it even."


Joyce looked outraged. "What? She beat the crap out of us! Why should we just let it go?"


Her friends chimed in, just as outraged.



Meanwhile,Elissa leaned toward the president and whispered with a sweet smile, "My dad's set to donate $1 milion to the school. Just thought you should know."


The president's expression shifted. His tone changed. "Daisy," he began, "what they did was wrong. But your response was excessive. This could've been handled differently. You can either apologize now and move forward, or you'll be expelled. And if you upload that video,trust me, public opinion won't be on your side.That would be reckless."


Arabella stared at him. So that was what this was.


Now she understood why Daisy had been
stepped on for so long.


These people weren't protecting students-they were protecting their pockets.


Joyce, smelling victory, leaned back with a smug grin. "Daisy, you really thought you had the upper hand? You're nothing but a parasite clinging to Elissa's family like a leech. Don't act like you matter. You want to stay here? Then get on your knees and lick my shoes clean. Maybe,just maybe, I'll let you off the hook."
###Chapter 7 Quite The Scene
Joyce looked at Arabella like she wasn't even human.


Elissa didn't say anything at first, but the fire burning behind her calm expression gave her away. Her throat still hurt, and what bothered her more was the embarrassment. Deep down,she wanted to lash out at Arabella. But on the outside, she just let out a quiet sigh, like she was more hurt than mad.


"Daisy, I honestly don't know what happened to you," she said. "But if youcan't apologize to us,then pack your things. You're no longer welcome in my home."


The president didn't bat an eye. "That's enough. You're done here. Pack up and get out." He waved Arabella off like she was a fly in the room before turning to Elissa with a tight smile. "You're injured. Go rest. We'll take care of
everything."


Joyce smirked, finally feeling like the universe had balanced itself. With their heads held high,they all moved to strut out like they had won a prize.



"Quite the scene," came a calm voice from the doorway, making everyone stiffen instantly.



All eyes turned. A man stepped in, bathed in light, his face carved like a statue-flawless and unreadable.



His outfit was pure black. But not just any black -the kind that spoke in silence. From his shoes to his collared shirt, every piece looked tailored to make people uncomfortable.


"Oh my God..." The president stared like he had seen things.


Then, breaking into a nervous sweat, he rushed over. "Mr. Gordon! I... I didn't know you were visiting today!"
Asher didn't bother acknowledging him.Instead, it was his assistant, Dominick, who stepped forward, calm as ever. "We happened to be nearby. Sounded like things were getting interesting."


Just then, Arabella's phone vibrated. She glanced down.


"Is Asher with you?" It was a message from the deputy director at Griridge University's dance department.


Arabella typed back quickly. "Yeah. He's here.Don't come."



The response came back almost instantly."Good. I'm not brave enough to deal with that man. He's terrifying but fair. You'll be alright with him there."


Arabella didn't bother replying anymore.


The president, still hoping to stay in control,jumped in. "It's nothing serious, Mr. Gordon.Just a student causing trouble. We've already
handled it-expulsion's done."


He shot a quick glance at Arabella, clearly blaming her.


Dominick let out a short, cold laugh. "Really?That quick,huh?"


Joyce's eyes were glued to Asher. Her heart was hammering so loud she could hardly breathe. The pain in her leg? Gone. Her pride?Forgotten. All she saw was him. "Who is that guy?" she whispered, almost dazed. "He's...unbelievable."


"I've never seen him before," Elissa replied, just as shaken. Her voice lowered. "Maybe he's someone's assistant?"


Since Dominick had been doing all the talking,everyone assumed he was the one calling the shots.


Asher, on the other hand, remained quiet and still, which didn't match what they expected from someone important-throwing the
students off even more.


However, that illusion shattered the moment he spoke. His voice sliced through the room like a blade. "Expelled?" he said, slow and cold."That's all you've got?"


Joyce's heart skipped. Her cheeks flushed,but she forced a playful smile. "We were beaten pretty badly, you know. How about this? Daisy can run ten laps around the field and apologize as she runs. That's fair, right?"


Asher's lips quirked, just barely. They were unnaturally red, giving him a strange, dangerous allure. "That's it?" he echoed, his voice silk and steel.


"Was that... not enough?" Joyce muttered under her breath as she winked at Elissa.


Elissa took the hint and jumped in. "Daisy, you really did hurt all of us. Be responsible. Get on your knees and apologize-properly-to each one of us."
Asher nodded slowly, his tone unreadable. "I agree."


Elissa's chest lifted slightly, pleased. He was on their side.


But then Asher added, flatly, "Then that's exactly what you'll do."


Before they could react, Dominick turned to the president with a smooth efficiency. "You heard them.Do it. Word for word."


The president's jaw dropped. "Wait, what? You mean them?" He gestured at Joyce's group,flustered. "They were the victims..."


Dominick's polite expression vanished. His voice went cold and final. "You think we came here without knowing everything? Handle it.Then clear your office out."


The president went ghostly pale. His knees wobbled like they might give out.


What was happening?
Dominick turned to the group. "Well? You heard the man. Kneel and apologize. One by one.You've got sixty seconds."


The arrogance drained from their faces like a faucet had been turned off. Joyce's eyes widened in disbelief. "You're joking. You want us to kneel? To her?"


Dominick calmly picked up his phone. "Alright.Then, starting now, every ten seconds, your family's stock drops by a point."


Joyce scoffed. "You're bluffing."


Her family wasn't at the top, but they were major players in Griridge.


No way a random guy could crash stocks with a threat.



But ten seconds later, her phone lit up. Multiple stock reports flashed across their screens.Their family shares had dropped. Not just hers-Elissa's, Kenzie's, even the boys'.
The color drained from their faces in real time.



Joyce stared at her screen in horror. "No! How is this even happening?"



In less than a minute, they were down hundreds of millions. And still dropping.
###Chapter 8 Wasn't This Your Brilliant Idea
Joyce and her group were hit with a wave of fear. The two men standing in front of them gave off such a strong, scary presence that it made their skin crawl.


"I'm sorry!"



The first crack came from one of the boys.His voice wobbled as he dropped to his knees in front of Arabella.


The sound of his apology cut through the room like glass on tile.


He kept his gaze glued to the floor, terrified to make eye contact.



His family didn't have a safety net, just a humble business built from scratch by his parents. If it went under, his future would be ruined.
Arabella looked down at him, her face impossible to read.


Another second passed, and then came the next collapse. Another boy slammed to his knees beside the first. "I'm sorry!" he cried,louder this time.


He had tried to hold out, but with his family's stocks plunging into free fall, pride became a luxury he couldn't afford.



Joyce stood frozen, her blood boiling. They were apologizing to her? Daisy? What the hell was wrong with them?


She met Arabella's gaze with fire in her eyes."You must be delusional if you think I'd ever kneel to you!"


Then her phone buzzed. A news alert. "Lambert Group stock hits lower limit." The words felt like a slap.


Her vision blurred. Her legs buckled under the weight of it, and she crumpled to the floor, too

stunned to breathe.



Elissa wasn't doing much better. Her phone lit up with panicked messages from her family group chat, everyone losing it astheir stocks free-fell, wondering if they had offended someone powerful.


She turned to Arabella, her eyes glossy with desperation. "Daisy... we're basically family,aren't we? Can't you go easy on us?"


Joyce, clinging to her pride, spat bitterly, "You freeloading bitch! You lived off Elissa's family,ate their meals, and slept in their home, and now you want us to beg? You're not even worth the dirt on my shoe!"


Arabella stayed cool as ever, casually inspecting her nails, like their words were nothing more than a dull buzz in the background.


That silent indifference was a slap harder than any insult.


Joyce's fury burned hotter than ever, but deep
down, fear was starting to take over.


Suddenly, with a loud thud, she fell to her knees. "I'm sorry!" she shouted, clearly not meaning it.


Arabella's eyes turned cold, and her voice was flat. "You think that counts as an apology?"


Joyce bit down so hard she could taste blood.


Despite her frustration, she knew better than to keep pushing. If her family's company collapsed, so would everything she had built-her image, her status, her power. Swallowing her pride, she mumbled, "I'm sorry."


Watching Joyce surrender, Elissa went pale.She stared at Arabella, completely thrown. This wasn't the same pushover she used to boss around. This girl standing in front of her now was someone else entirely.


Red-faced and burning with humiliation, Elissa lowered herself to her knees, the shame soaking into her skin. "Daisy, I'm sorry," she
whispered, each syllable tasting worse than bile.


Dominick calmly slid his phone into his pocket."That's one part done. Now onto the next. Ten laps around the racetrack. Keep apologizing as you run."


Joyce, Elissa, and the others looked stunned,like the air had been knocked out of them. Their faces fell right away.


Elissa, desperate, turned to Arabella with shaky words. "Daisy, are you serious? You're really going to make us do this?"


Arabella tilted her head, the faintest smirk curling on her lips. "Wait, wasn't this your brilliant idea?"


Elissa's mouth opened, but no words came.Nothing she said could flip this situation anymore.


As she passed by Dominick, she shot him a look full of teary-eyed desperation, but he didn't
even blink. Her only option was to grit her teeth and move on.


Meanwhile, Asher turned to the president, his tone razor-sharp and deliberate. "You can pack up your office and leave."


"Please, Mr. Gordon!" the president blurted,falling to his knees in panic. "I'm begging you!Give me one more chance!"


He felt like his entire career was crumbling to ash.


He had fought tooth and nail to become the president, and now everything was slipping through his fingers.


But Asher didn't even glance at him. Instead, his attention shifted back to Arabella. "Miss Stanley, don't you want front-row seats to this little spectacle?"


Arabella gave him a thoughtful look, clearly impressed. "Well, since you went to all this trouble, it'd be rude to miss the main act,
wouldn't it?"


Asher's eyes twitched slightly with a half-smile.He seemed to enjoy her boldness.


Outside, the energy was electric. Word had already spread like wildfire, and the students had gathered, phones out, eyes wide, ready for the drama to unfold.


No one expected Elissa and her gang to come out with teary eyes, heading straight to the racetrack.


"I'm sorry! I messed up!" one of them yelled while jogging, and the rest repeated it again and again, their voices following them like a chant as they ran.


The crowd stood frozen, stunned beyond belief.


"Unbelievable! Joyce and her squad? Getting punished? For real?"


"Joyce ddeserves it, though. She's a bully."


"Honestly, Joyce has bullied Daisy forever. Sure,

Daisy fought back hard, but Joyce isn't exactly innocent either."



Arabella was standing quietly by the racetrack and observing when a girl walked up to her,looking both amazed and unsure. "Wait... you're not really Daisy, are you?"
###Chapter 9 Call It Karma
Arabella narrowed her eyes, giving the long-haired girl in front of her a slow once-over.She was attractive, sharp-featured, and clearly not just another onlooker.


Kaitlyn Price, the girl, spoke up, her tone cool and deliberate. "Daisy's never been the type to fight back."



"Then who do you think I am?" Arabella asked lazily.


Kaitlyn didn't even blink. "You're the side of her we never saw. The part she kept buried. Her alter ego."


For a second, Arabella went still, her mind ticking.



She had seriously overestimated Daisy's classmates.
Kaitlyn's eyes swept over her, curious yet guarded. "So, what changed? You finally decided to show your teeth. But how did you pull this off?"


Arabella's lips curved into a quiet smile. "Call it karma. Sooner or later, everyone gets what's coming."


Before Kaitlyn could respond, a ragged voice broke through the moment. Elissa stumbled over, drenched in sweat and gasping for breath."Daisy... ten laps? That's crazy! Come on, two is enough,right? Anymore and we'll collapse!"


Elissa's eyes brimmed with tears, her voice shaky. "Okay, we messed up. But this whole thing didn't just fall on us. You stirred the pot too! We said sorry. Can't you stop dragging everyone else into this?"


Her whining hit a nerve with the crowd. The surrounding students began throwing sideways glances at Arabella, judgment seeping into their expressions.
There was no way a regular girl could force apologies Elissa and her group, not unless she had some serious power backing her.


Joyce, running a few steps behind, shot out a spiteful comment between breaths. "Daisy,you've managed to cling to a big shot's cocktails. But don't get cocky-people like you always get left behind."


The truth was, none of them believed Arabella actually had ties to the school board. They figured Asher's appearance was a one-off stroke of luck. And now, they were doubling down, trying to flip the script to make her the villain in front of the whole school.


One by one, students around her began to pull away, inching back like she was radioactive.



Arabella just gave a sharp laugh. "If those apologies were fake, then guess what? You still owe me ten laps, Joyce."


Joyce's face turned bright red with anger,but
the fear of running endlessly made her bite her tongue.She stayed quiet and kept jogging.


Even Elissa, seeing no mercy in Arabela's eyes,dragged her exhausted self back into the loop.


For pampered rich kids like them, this wasn't just punishment-it was pure agony.


By the fifth lap, Elissa's legs finally gave out.She collapsed on the track, her body folding in on itself.



"Elissa!"



"Someone help her!"


"This is too much! Daisy, what's wrong with you? She's in the Griridge Troupe! If she's hurt,the whole Dance Association will come after you!"


Several students rushed forward,helping Elissa sit up.



But Arabella didn't budge. Her face was unreadable, like it was carved from stone, while
her voice remained cold. "Once she wakes up,tell her to keep going."


Asher had already stationed a teacher nearby to make sure no one cheated.


Elissa had fully planned to fake a dramatic faint to get out of the run. But just as she started pulling the stunt, she got a message from home -if she bailed, the Tucker Group would be driven into bankruptcy.


That warning was enough to jolt her back to her feet. Gritting her teeth, she dragged her aching body around the track, lap after lap.


By the time they hit ten laps, their legs felt like rubber, and they were completely drained. Still fuming, they tried to salvage their dignity online,venting on the schooI forum by throwing mud at Daisy. But every time they posted something,it vanished almost immediately.


"What the hell is going on now?" Joyce snapped, slamming her phone down.
A classmate glanced at her screen. "Must be a system bug or something."


Joyce rolled her eyes hard. "Damn it. That cursed Daisy's got luck on her side now, huh?"






Later that evening, Arabella quietly made her way to the hospital.


Daisy was still unconscious.


Sitting beside her, Arabella opened her laptop and got to work-setting up filters to block any hateful posts about Daisy from spreading online.


At the same time, she made sure everything about Elissa and her group stayed visible and trending.


"Now that the school punished Elissa and Joyce, honestly, their behavior toward Daisy was next-level messed up."



"Remember Daisy's big dance performance?
She lit up the stage... then suddenly, she's tumbling down the stairs the very next day?"


"Not saying it out loud, but doesn'tthat feel a little too coincidental?"


"Elissa's always appeared kind and easygoing,but we've all seen her true colors. Daisy was the real talent."


As more students joined the conversation,the forum exploded with activity.


Hidden behind their screens and with no names attached, everyone spoke freely without holding anything back.


"No offense, but I watched both their performances. Daisy owned the stage, while Elissa looked like she was still in rehearsal."
###Chapter 10 You're Too Soft
"Are you people seriously losing it? Daisy lives at Elissa's house and still bullies her. Joyce and her girls weren't out of line-they were defending Elissa!"


"Exactly.I'm with you."



Arabella quietly opened a fresh account and clapped back, "Wait, but Daisy never broke Elissa's leg. Elissa puts on this act like she's all kind and caring, but it's just a mask. Every time Joyce picked on Daisy, Elissa stood by like it wasn't her problem. If Elissa were really the victim, then why is she still all glammed up while Daisy looks like she got dragged through hell?"



One user wrote, "Damn. That makes so much sense now. Elissa's always low-key manipulating people to go after Daisy. That's some next-level mean girl energy."
"I always thought Elissa was manipulative,"another added.


"I once saw Joyce literally beating Daisy in a hallway, and Elissa just stood there watching.Like,seriously?"


The posts hit a nerve, and people couldn't stop thinking about them.



On the other hand, Elissa saw the posts and lost it. With a scream of frustration, she swept everything off her vanity-the clatter of palettes and perfume bottles crashing to the floor filled the room.


She was furious at how quickly everyone seemed to buy into the narrative.


And what was up with Daisy? It felt like she had flipped into a totally different person overnight.


Elissa could feel her carefully built image falling apart in real time.


"That two-faced snake," she thought,seething.
Desperate to get answers, she called her mom,but the second the call connected, she was hit with the sound of sobbing. "Mom?" Elissa's voice sharpened. "What's going on?"


"Vanguard just ended all cooperation with us.We've got no incoming cash now. I don't know what to do," Meagan cried, on the verge of panic.


Elissa's mind reeled. "That can't be. Didn't they think highly of Dad? Out of everyone in Griridge,they chose him to lead their top projects!"


"I can't explain it," Meagan replied. "Your dad and I are going to talk to them.Elissa,come with us if you can." Of course, Meagan had her own plan brewing.


Elissa had the looks and the charm, so Meagan was hoping the president of Vanguard Group might notice. If he did, it could solve all their problems.


The second Elissa thought of the mysterious
president of Vanguard Group, she didn't even think twice. "Count me in," she said.


Right after she ended the call, Elissa realized she had completely forgotten to bring up Daisy.



"Screw it. I'll handle that snake on my own," she growled under her breath.



A shadow passed over Elissa's face as she picked up her phone and began typing, her fingers moving fast and furiously.


Meanwhile, in the quiet hospital room, Arabella sat beside Daisy, watching her silently.


Daisy's short hair was uneven and tangled,and her face was still covered in bruises. Even with all the care Arabella had given her, she still looked beaten and fragile. Arabella reached out and softly touched Daisy's cold cheek, not even realizing the tears that had started sliding down her own face.


Suddenly, Daisy's phone lit up with a buzz.
It was an old phone, clearly a few generations behind. Arabella struggled briefly before managing to open the video message.


"Wow, Daisy, you're all bones-except those boobs!" The video showed a bathroom scene.Daisy was on her knees, curled uup tightly and holding herself. Three or four women surrounded her, pulling at her clothes, most of which were already ripped. Their faces were twisted with smug, cruel smiles. Joyce stood among them, laughing loudly. "Just look at you,Daisy. What are you hoping for, some prince to rescue your filthy ass? Get real! Who the hell would save someone like you?"


Elissa's voice came from the side, light and almost playful. "Alright, that's enough, Joyce."


Joyce rolled her eyes. "Elissa, you're too soft.Honestly, where would you be without us? I'm teaching this little bitch a lesson today-rip it all off!"


The camera wobbled as the one filming burst
out laughing, but it stayed trained on Daisy.


"Please! Stop! I'm begging you!" Her desperate pleas only seemed to egg them on further.


Joyce howled with laughter, while Elissa's lips twitched into a slight smirk before she forced on a frown. "Joyce, you're awful," she said with fake disapproval.


Rage surged through Arabella, but she clenched her fists and forced herself to watch to the end.


The girls yanked off the last of Daisy's clothes.She screamed, completely exposed and trembling. Laughing like it was all some twisted game, they poured dirty water over her,ignoring her cries for help.
###Chapter 11 You Know How To Reach Me
Arabella tightened her grip on her phone,leaving a faint crack splitting across it.


In the final moments of the video, the bullies walked away, still laughing, while Daisy lay there in a puddle of dirty water-her eyes empty, like a broken doll.



"God, look at her. What a mess," someone sneered, and Arabella instantly recognized Kenzie's voice.


So she was the one filming.



"Such a shame," Joyce added with a mocking tone. "Should we call some guy to cheer her up?"


"Nah, let's not," Elissa replied. "Class is starting soon. We don't need this blowing up."
And just like that, the video cut out.


Another crack snaked across Arabella's screen.



Her breath hitched. Her whole chest burned.Just as she was about to lose herself to the rage, a hand closed firmly over hers-cool and steady. The sudden touch jolted her back. She turned and there he was.


"Asher?" She blinked, stunned.



When had he even walked in?


"That video... it's all the proof you need." His tone was flat and low.


Arabella quickly pulled her hand free. Her cheeks were still streaked with tears, but her voice held steady. "What are you doing here?"


"Making sure you don't do anything stupid," he replied bluntly. "There are smarter ways to make them suffer. Legal ones. Psychological ones. Take your pick."


Arabella gave him a sharp look. "You don't have
to worry. I'm not going to let them off easy.They don't deserve a quick ending. I want them to rot. I want them to know what it's like to be on the ground, begging for mercy."


Her voice trembled slightly, and not from fear,but from the sheer weight of fury she was holding back.


Asher studied her face for a long second."Are you sure you can handle this on your own?"



"I can." Her answer came without hesitation."Thanks for today."


He gave a short nod. "If you change your mind,you know how to reach me."


Without another word, he turned and left.



Something on the bedside table caught Arabella's eye-a black card, simple and sleek.She didn't touch it.



What a strange guy.


He came off cold and tough, but honestly, he
was way better than all those people who pretended to be nice. Maybe someday, they could actually work together.


Arabella stepped out of the hospital room, still processing everything.


Not far off, chaos erupted in the dermatology wing. Khloe's shrill voice echoed through the hallway.


"You people call yourselves doctors? I spent a fortune here, and now you're telling me my face is ruined?" Her breath was short, and her knees buckled slightly as the weight of the news sank in.



Her face-her flawless, perfect face-was her entire identity. Without it, what did she even have?


The doctor kept her expression professional,but there was visible strain. "The scarring runs deep. We've tried every possible treatment. I'm sorry, but the damage is irreversible."
Khloe lost it. "Useless! Every last one of you!"


The doctor's hands curled into tight fists at her sides. There was so much she wanted to say,but she bit it back and said nothing.


Khloe shot to her feet, refusing to accept the final word. She was going to find another hospital, one that actually knew what it was doing.


In her mind, only one person was to blame-Arabella. That cold-hearted lunatic had destroyed her face. And if fate ever brought them face-to-face again, she swore she would make her suffer for it.


Fuming under her breath, Khloe stormed out of the clinic. As she walked, she pulled out her phone and began frantically searching for any doctor that might be able to undo the damage.


Then she stumbled across a post. "My face was badly burned in a fire. Doctors told me I'd have permanent scars, but this cream saved me. It's
expensive and only sold in Melmond, but it works."


Expensive? That didn't scare Khloe. She had money to burn. She quickly texted the person behind the post, who replied almost immediately. "It's 100 grand per tube. Comes from a private lab in Melmond. Super exclusive,but it's the real deal."


Khloe blinked. A hundred thousand?



That was insane.



And still-no promises that it would actually fix her face.



Reluctantly, she decided to keep that as a backup plan. For now, she would check a few more hospitals.


Yet after hours of consultation and disappointment, the verdict remained the same everywhere she went: the scars were permanent.
Left with no other option, Khloe messaged the seller again. "Fine. 100 grand. When can I get it?"


Meanwhile, from a hospital window above,Arabella watched Khloe walk off.


A few minutes later, her phone buzzed with a message. "She took the bait."


Arabella gave a small, satisfied nod and turned back into Daisy's room. She sat by her sister's bed and gently brushed a strand of hair from her face. "Don't worry, Daisy," she whispered."They'll all pay for what they did to you."



Sitting down, she opened her laptop and began working through her plan.


She stayed up through the night, only dozing off beside Daisy when the first light of morning crept in.


When she woke up, there was a bedsheet gently draped over her. She didn't know who had left it, but something told her that it was
Asher.


Even though their father was long gone, his old buddy's son shielded them for his sake. She smiled faintly, just for a moment.


Just then, her phone buzzed again.


"Isabella, the project's wrapped up! When are you joining us again? We need our superstar back!"


Arabella typed a short reply. "No time."


The person replied almost instantly, "What's keeping you? Got something better than this?"


"School," she responded simply.


The person on the other end blinked in surprise.


School?


Hadn't Isabella already graduated during the project?


That didn't make sense. What kind of school was worth Isabella's time now? Suspicious,the
person immediately rang up Joshua.

Arabella packed up Daisy's belongings and quietly slipped out, heading straight to Griridge University without a second of hesitation.


Over in the campus dance studio, Elissa and Joyce strolled in, expecting attention.


Back in their prime, the room would have lit up with people greeting them, fawning over them.But today? There were just stiff glances and awkward silence.


Elissa's expression turned sour. This wasn't the welcome she was used to.
###Chapter 12 I Earned It
Joyce looked like she was about to blow a fuse."Are you all seriously buying into those random online posts? Have you completely forgotten who Elissa is? She's always had your backs!"


The students around her shifted uncomfortably,muttering half-hearted greetings.


"Hey,Elissa..."



"Morning..." The words came out stiff, like they were being dragged.


Just then, Arabella strolled in, her voice cutting through the tension like a knife. "Starting your day by bullying someone again?"


"You've got guts showing your face here!"Joyce shouted and tried to slap her. But Arabella moved just in time with a small smile,and Joyce lost her balance and fell to the floor with a loud thud.
"Ow, damn it!" Joyce cried, pain shooting through her already sore body from yesterday's brutal laps.


Elissa winced. Joyce always had more bark than bite and never knew when to back down.



Eyes narrowing, Elissa met Arabella's gaze and muttered, "You've really changed, Daisy. Or maybe this is who you were all along."


"You guessed it," Arabella said with a low laugh."And this version? She's your worst nightmare."



Elissa's eyes flared with irritation, but then a smug smile formed on her lips. "Joyce is the best dancer we've got. The Griridge Troupe has had their eyes on her for months. You picked the wrong rival, Daisy. One word from her,and your spotlight dream goes up in smoke."


At that moment, the teacher entered. Her expression was hard to read as she scanned the room. "Daisy, a word outside," she said.


Joyce grinned at Arabella's retreating back.
"Watch, she's about to get chewed out big time."


Then she turned to Elissa and whispered, "Hey,what's going on with Daisy? She's acting so weird lately. You think she's, like, possessed or something?"


Elissa rolled her eyes. "She's not possessed,just pissed off. Even doormats will bite back if you step on them enough. I told you not to push her that hard."


Joyce snorted. "Let her come at me again. I've already got the perfect plan lined up to wreck her."


Outside, Arabella stood face-to-face with the teacher.


"Miss Stanley," the teacher began. "You've been selected as a candidate for the Griridge Troupe.Care to explain how that happened?"


Arabella's voice was calm and steady. "I earned it.Simple as that."
Zoe Miller, her teacher, looked like she had swallowed a lemon. "Have I taught you nothing about humility? You haven't been practicing at all. And you really think you're better than Joyce?"


Arabella didn't blink. "Not just better. Joyce isn't even close."



Zoe's face flushed deep red. "You're way too arrogant. Just step aside and let Joyce have the spot."


Arabella tilted her head. "Why? Because she's your niece,right?"


Zoe stiffened. For a split second, her mask cracked.How did she know that?


Still, she quickly regained composure. "The Troupe only wants the best. You'll embarrass yourself. Step down now, and I'll make sure you get a scholarship instead.Sounds fair?"


Arabella's stare sharpened. This Zoe woman had turned a blind eye to everything because
she was Joyce's aunt. By letting Joyce bully others, she was just as guilty.


"Not happening," Arabella responded flatly, and walked away.


Back in the studio, students looked up as she entered. Zoe followed shortly after.


Joyce was practically vibrating with anticipation."Miss. Miller, did the results come in yet?"


She could already picture it-snagging the spot,then making sure Daisy never got another shot.


Zoe hesitated. "They did."


Joyce leaned in. "So... who made it?"


"It's... Daisy," Zoe said, biting her lip as she

gave Arabella a pointed look. "Be prepared.

Rehearsals at the theater start tomorrow."
###Chapter 13 Stay Out Of This!
"No freaking way!" Joyce shouted, her voice bouncing off the walls. "Daisy? With that messed-up leg? How did she get chosen?"


Zoe sighed. "It came from the top. The decision's final. Now let's focus-class is starting."


The other students looked at Arabella with jealous eyes.



As the lesson dragged on, soft whispers passed between students like background static.


"Daisy used to be an amazing dancer. I saw her performance yesterday, and she's even better now."


"Same here. Honestly, Elissa can't hold a candle to her anymore."



Once class ended and Zoe walked out, Joyce
marched straight toward Arabella, but Elissa stepped in, blocking her path with a subtle shake of her head.


The rest of the day went by quietly. No one tried to make Arabella's life miserable until after school.


Arabella stepped into the restroom and entered one of the stalls, locking the door behind her.



Moments later, heavy footsteps echoed into the tiled space.



"Well, well... where are you, Daisy?" Joyce called out mockingly, laughing as she kicked open one stall after another.


Two bulky girls flanked her, clearly ready to back her up.


Joyce's lips curled into a wicked grin when she reached the final door. "There you are. Playing hide-and-seek with me all day, huh?"


She lifted her foot to kick the door, and before
she could hit it, Arabella shoved the door open from inside, slamming it right into Joyce's leg.The pain shot up instantly.


She glared at Arabella, who stood there calmly,then shouted, "Grab her!"


The two heavyset girls lunged, dragging Arabella out roughly.


Just then, a voice called out from the doorway.


"Stop it! This isn't right!"


It was Kaitlyn.



"Back off, Kaitlyn! Stay out of this!" Joyce snapped.


Kaitlyn glanced at Arabella, clearly worried, but Arabella's expression stayed cool and composed. She silently mouthed, "Get out of here.I can handle it."


Kaitlyn hesitated, caught off guard by the calm confidence in her friend's eyes. It didn't feel like the same Daisy she used to know.
Arabella mouthed again, firmer this time, "Go."


Kaitlyn gave a small nod, clenched her fists, and walked out.



Now, it was just the four of them.


"You humiliated me yesterday, and now you're gonna pay!" Joyce shouted and swung a punch at Arabella's face. Arabella dodged with a quick tilt of her head, making Joyce even angrier. She tried to grab Arabella's hair, but Arabella kicked her hard, sending her straight to the floor. Joyce groaned, holding her stomach in pain.



"You two idiots, hold her down!" Joyce yelled.



The two bigger girls rushed over and pushed Arabella to the floor. One of them hit her in frustration. "What's your problem? Just stay down,bitch!"



Joyce, seething, snatched a mop bucket nearby and stormed over, her eyes blazing. "You're finished,Daisy! You hear me? Done!"
But in a flash, Arabella slipped free, grabbed both women by the head, and slammed them together. Dirty water flew everywhere, soaking them as they stumbled back in shock.


"Ugh! That's nasty!" one shrieked.


"Watch where you're swinging, Joyce!"


"It stinks like sewer water!"


The girls scrambled, squealing and flailing.


Joyce snapped. "What the hell is wrong with you two? You can't even take down one person?"



The two bulky women tried to grab Arabella again, but she quickly stepped back and kicked hard, sending one of them flying into the wall.She hit the floor, coughing up blood.



Arabella then turned to the other girl,who was shaking and slowly backing away in fear. "No...Please...don't!"


Arabella grabbed her by the hair, twisted her
around, and flung her toward the wall. Her body hit hard, and she slid down, groaning and retching on the floor.


Joyce stood frozen, struggling to process what she just witnessed. "No! This isn't Daisy," she muttered, completely ratled.


After dealing with the girls, Arabella slowly turned her eyes on Joyce and started walking toward her. Joyce's bravado vanished in an instant. She backed away, trembling, like she was staring down a nightmare. "W-who are you? What are you?" she stammered.


She turned and tried to run, but Arabella yanked her back by the hair, slammed the restroom door shut, and threw her onto the floor. She pinned Joyce down with a foot pressed firmly on her head.


"What's the matter?" Arabella asked quietly,almost taunting. "Elissa's not here with you this time?"
Joyce sobbed. "Elissa's at a meeting with the CEO of Vanguard Group! She's about to be his wife-if you hurt me, she'll destroy you!"


Arabella's smile didn't reach her eyes. "No, she won't," she said flatly. Then she glanced around. "So... just the four of us? That's no fun at all."


Her voice dropped, low and chilling. "Let's play a game instead."
###Chapter 14 Let Me Out!
Arabella's mouth curled into a sly grin,one that hinted at mischief and something much darker.


Joyce's words came out shaky. "What kind of game are you talking about?"


With a quiet laugh and icy eyes, Arabella laid down the rules. "The first person to strip the other gets to leave."


She hauled Joyce to her feet and shoved her straight at the two heavier girls.


Anger flashed in Joyce's eyes as she snapped,"You're taking things way too far!"


Arabella hovered over them, her presence almost suffocating. "If you won't make a move,then I will."


At that moment, Joyce finally understood just how determined Arabella was to settle the
score.


Taking a deep breath, Joyce spun toward the door and made a break for it.


She barely got far when the hard end of a mop crashed into her back, sending her sprawling to the floor in pain.


Arabella's laughter echoed through the room,low and menacing. "Did you really believe you could get away?"


Still shaking, Joyce glared up at Arabella. Deep down, she knew she could not outmnatch her.Was there any chance of escaping her twisted plan?


Making her decision, Joyce lunged at one of the bigger girls, grabbing handfuls of fabric and tearing at her clothes.


The girl gasped, outrage and disbelief clear in her voice. "Joyce, what do you think you're doing?"
Joyce kept going, shouting, "Let me out first and I'll help you!"


Refusing the offer, the girl noticed Arabella with her phone out and started to panic. She shoved Joyce aside, but Joyce came right back,determined to rip at her clothes again.Frustrated and angry, the girl fought back,tugging at Joyce's own outfit. "If you keep this up, we're all in trouble!"


No one held back from the other hefty girl either, and before long, the whole group was locked in a wild and messy fight.


Joyce yelled triumphantly, "I made it!" She was the first to strip one of the girls, but within seconds, the others had ripped her clothes off as well.


She spun around and glared at Arabella. "Let me out!"


A chill crept into Arabella's voice. "Slow down.There's one more round. You're going to slap
each other until someone gets to a hundred.The first to finish can leave. This is your last shot."


The demand nearly broke Joyce's composure."You're just playing us!"


Arabella's expression turned stone cold. "That's right, I am. Do you have a problem with it? If you refuse, I'll step in and you won't like how I do it."



All three girls shrank back, remembering just how strong Arabella could be. Hesitantly,they eyed each other until, finally, someone lifted a hand and delivered the first slap. Another quickly hit back.


"That hurt! What's your problem?"



"Joyce, you're no better!"



The first few blows were half-hearted, but the anger grew, and soon they were striking each other with real force. Red marks turned into swollen faces, and bruises quickly followed.
While they fought, Arabella kept her phone rolling, a little disappointed that Elissa was missing all the fun.


"Elissa has gone off to the Vanguard Group to charm its president?


She is giving herself too much credit," Arabella muttered to herself, with a sly glimmer in her eyes.


After a hundred slaps, their faces were battered and swollen. Looking around, they realized Arabella had disappeared.


Fury flared in Joyce's eyes. "That damn Daisy!She's going to pay for this!"


Just then, the door swung open and someone took one look at them before screaming, "Oh my God!"


The shout brought a crowd of students running.They stopped in their tracks, staring in disbelief at the battered women.
Joyce blurted out in anger, her humiliation boiling over, "Stop gawking! I'll claw your eyes out!"


Not far away, Kaitlyn caught a glimpse of the chaos and quietly slipped out of sight.


The aftermath didn't take long to blow up online. Joyce and her two followers became the hottest topic on the campus forum, with wild guesses and even a flood of shocking pictures.


Later, when Joyce saw the posts from home,her rage got the best of her and she hurled a vase to the floor, smashing it to pieces.


"I have to bring Daisy down. No matter what it takes, I'll figure out a way," Joyce muttered to herself.


Heat surged through Joyce's veins.


She slammed her fist into the pillow over and over, unable to calm herself.


Meanwhile, Elissa showed up at the Vanguard
Group with her parents, dressed to impress and completely taken aback by the luxurious,modern style of the building.


Her own family always seemed wealthy to her,but the Vanguard Group operated on an entirely different level.


A spark of ambition lit up Elissa's face. Winning over the Vanguard Group's president became her top priority.


The group did not make it far before they were stopped.


The receptionist eyed them with a polite but firm look. "If you don't have an appointment,you can't meet the CEO."


Meagan's husband stepped forward, his tone confident. "I'm Bennie Tucker, chairman of the Tucker Group. I've partnered with the Vanguard Group several times before. The CEO will definitely see me."


Bennie felt certain the Vanguard Group would
always support him because of his solid business record.


The receptionist glanced at her screen. "Bennie Tucker?" Her brow furrowed. "I'm sorry, you aren't listed on the CEO's special guest list."


Frustration colored Bennie's voice. "Is something wrong with your system?"


While he and Meagan stood in front of the counter, Elissa saw her chance. She edged past them and hurried toward the elevator,unnoticed.


Watching Elissa slip away, Meagan tugged at Bennie's sleeve. "Let's just wait outside for now."


The receptionist soon caught on and quickly dialed the president's office. "There's someone coming up. Looks like she's Bennie Tucker's daughter."


A calm reply came from the other end. "Let her come up."
Meagan caught what was said and couldn't hide her excitement. She pulled Bennie along,whispering, "They let Elissa through. Maybe the CEO likes her?"


Bennie grinned, pride clear in his eyes. "Elissa's a star on stage and she's beautiful, too. If she ends up with Mr. Willis, we won't ever have to worry again."


Elissa made it to the president's floor without any trouble.


Every step down the tastefully decorated hallway sent her nerves fluttering. She paused for a moment, took a steadying breath, and then pushed open the office door.


Her gaze landed on Joshua, seated behind an impressive desk. She was surprised to find that he looked both young and strikingly handsome.



A bright smile flashed across Elissa's face before she shifted to a more remorseful expression. She walked closer, her eyes
glistening as she said, "Mr. Willis, I'm sorry for coming in like this."


Joshua studied her for a second. "And who are you?"


Dressed in a flowing white dress, Elissa looked fragile, her eyes still a little red. "I'm Elissa,Bennie Tucker's daughter. I know my family must have made some mistakes. I just wanted to say thank you for everything you've done for us."


Elissa stepped even closer, her gentle demeanor difficult to ignore.


Joshua simply gave her a brief nod.



The lack of resistance gave Elissa hope.


Sometimes, not turning someone away was as good as acceptance.


In a soft voice, she invited, leaning in a little,"Mr. Willis, would you let me take you out to dinner to make up for everything?"
Her breath brushed his ear and he pulled back.The strong scent of her perfume started to bother him.


Standing up, Joshua kept his tone polite but firm. "I have too much on my plate today.Another time, perhaps. I've got a meeting now.Please see yourself out."


He left the office without another word.



For a moment, disappointment washed over Elissa. Then her eyes caught sight of a report left on his desk.


Reaching for it, she realized it contained a rundown of recent projects, highlighting the top performer among them...
###Chapter 15 Our Finances Are A Mess
A subtle shift passed through Elissa's gaze, just enough to show that she was thinking hard.


"Did Joshua do this on purpose?" she mused,her thoughts moving fast.


A slow,confident smile curved on her lips as she left her business card behind and strutted out of Joshua's office like she already had the upper hand.


Just a few minutes later, Joshua returned, this time with Arabella walking casually beside him.


"Arabella, don't you think this plan is a little too obvious? What if Elissa gets spooked and backs off?"



Arabella sank into the plush sofa like she owned the place, her voice flat and unbothered. "Relax,Joshua. They'll swallow it whole. Trust me,Elissa and her parents are nothing but fools."
"Fair enough," Joshua muttered, disgust twisting his mouth. "They've only been living large because we kept feeding them crumbs. If I'd known how low they'd stoop, I wouldn't have handed them a cent. We've just been too tied up with all these government projects to dig up the truth on them."


He paused, then looked at her curiously. "But seriously, don't you have other family around?Why didn't any of them stop your aunt from going rogue?"


Arabella's smirk was sharp and bitter. "Most of them are just bottom-feeders. When Dad was alive, they were lining up to kiss his boots like he was king. But the moment Meagan got her hands on some money, they ditched us like we were yesterday's trash. This time, I'm making sure every favor my dad ever gave them comes right back up, and they'll choke on it."


Meanwhile, Elissa rejoined her parents downstairs, and the three of them headed
home.


"So?" Meagan asked excitedly, barely able to wait. "What happened? Did Mr. Willis agree to the dinner?"


Bennie leaned in, equally eager to hear the juicy details.



Elissa gave a sly little grin. "He didn't agree to dinner, if that's what you're asking."


Meagan's face dropped. "Then why do you look like you just won the lottery?"


"Because I managed to sneak a glance at one of his company's latest project files," Elissa said,pulling out her phone with a confident flourish."Dad, we need to get our hands on this one."



She turned the screen toward Bennie, who squinted at the image. It looked like a typical business project on the surface, but the label caught his eye-it was ranked as Vanguard Group's number one.
Highly profitable. Big returns.


Bennie's interest was instantly piqued,though he kept a cool expression. "Are you sure Mr.Willis didn't just leave that out on purpose? A little bait to mess with you?"


"I don't think so," Elissa said, tossing her hair back. "I could tell he was interested in me.If he wasn't, I would've been out of there in two minutes flat. And from what I'veheard,Vanguard's run by a close-knit team. Maybe he can't just hand the project over, but he's clearly leaving hints for us to follow."


"That does make sense." Bennie nodded slowly."Still, you don't think he's baiting us, do you?And even if he's trying to help... we're broke,Elissa. Our finances are a mess."


"Mom, Dad, you remember how much our relatives owe us, right? They've been clinging to us like parasites for years. Now, if we flash a golden investment in front of them, do you really think thev'll resist?" Elissa said.
Bennie clapped his thigh with excitement. "Now that's my daughter talking! If we can rope in their money just once, we're in the clear.And when this is all over, we'll show them the door."


Elissa grinned to herself, riding high on the thrill of her own brilliance, and glanced at her phone,hoping for a message from Joshua.



However, just then, a text from Joyce popped up.



"Elissa, Daisy's gone totally crazy!"


Seconds later, Joyce called and quickly told her everything. Elissa's smile vanished, and her face darkened. Daisy had truly gone off the rails.



"Mom, Dad, how have you even been watching Daisy at home?" Elissa snapped, clearly not pleased.


"Daisy? She's still locked up in that doghouse like always," Meagan replied offhandedly.Then,seeing a moment to bring it up, she quickly added, "By the way, Elissa-about Arabella..."
But before Meagan could finish, her phone buzzed again, and this time it was the Griridge Troupe director. She held up a hand to hush Meagan and took the call.


When the call ended, Elissa let out a breath."The show's been mnoved up. Looks like I'll need to double down on rehearsals now."


"You've got this, Elissa," Meagan beamed,practically glowing with pride. "This is your chance to rise above the rest."


In her heart, she was soaring that her daughter's success would finally silence those smug old-money families who always sneered at them behind their backs.


As for Arabella, Meagan pushed her right out of her thoughts. She didn't see that girl as a real threat.



Elissa grabbed her things and headed off to the Griridge Theatre soon after.
Later that evening, Arabella sat quietly beside Daisy, keeping her usual watch. Every tiny improvement in Daisy's skin felt like a soothing balm on her own heart.


She leaned in and played a video near Daisy's ear-one where Joyce was being humiliated in front of everyone.


Joyce's shrill cries and pitiful sobs stirred something in Daisy. Her brows twitched into a small frown,then slowly relaxed.


"Daisy," Arabella whispered softly while brushing her sister's cheek with care, "they're finally getting what they deserve, and I made sure it hurts even more than what they did to you. Just wait,and they'll start turning on each other soon. Doesn't that sound like fun?"
###Chapter 16 Keep It Up!

Daisy was asleep.



But Arabella didn't need words-she knew if Daisy were conscious, she would be thrilled.Watching those bullies finally squirm would have made her day.


But this? This was just the teaser. The real show hadn't even started yet.



Arabella pulled out her phone and jumped onto the campus forum, curious to see if the drama had hit the rumor mill.


"Did anyone catch what happened to Joyce? She got totally destroyed!"


"I saw the whole thing! Bet she won't be showing her face anytime soon. Not gonna lie, it's kinda satisfying."


"She deserved it. But who did it? I need to know!"



"Pretty sure Daisy walked out right after. Could it have been her?"


"Joyce probably shoved Daisy down the stairs back then. Now Daisy's back, and she's like some
kind of tough avenger."


The students were loving the chaos, typing away like crazy. Being anonymous made it easy to say whatever they wanted without worrying who would find out.



But then Arabella saw something that made her pause-a name she knew way too well.


It was Kenzie, of all people.



The girl used to trail after Elissa like a shadow and had helped make Daisy's life miserable.


Arabella tapped on her profile to snoop a little.



Turned out, Kenzie had flipped. She was busy dragging Elissa all over the forum.


"Elissa's got nothing going for her. She copies my work and thinks she can buy my silence with a thousand bucks?Please."


One of Elissa's followers shot back, "You serious?Show some proof."


Kenzie wasn't having it. "I don't need to prove anything to you.Keep falling for her fake smile."


Arabella kept scrolling, and her eyes narrowed when she came across a private video Kenzie had uploaded.
-
It was a dance performance.


Kenzie had captioned it. "This was my original work. You all keep falling for Elissa's act. She's just a smooth-talking poser!"


Arabella raised an eyebrow. "Wow, she turned on Elissa faster than I expected."

She watched the whole thing, a slow smirk creeping up. This was too perfect.


The following morning...


As expected, Joyce was a no-show on campus.

Arabella ditched her classes that day and made her way to the Griridge Troupe's practice session.After rehearsals, she dropped by the Dance Association's office.


Inside, Jennifer Dawson, the vice president, was busy flipping through paperwork, and when she heard someone knock on the door, she called out,clearly irritated, "Who's there?"


But the moment she looked up and saw Arabella,her expression changed completely. Her jaw nearly hit the floor. "Oh my gosh...Isabella?"


Arabella gave a calm, knowing smile. "Surprised?Thought I'd drop by."
"Hold on-you're still a student?" Jennifer blinked, clearly caught off guard. "The president said you were filling in?"


"Yep,just helping out for now."


"You know what? I'm naming you captain on the spot," Jennifer said, looking almost too thrilled.


Arabella gave a calm shrug, her tone flat."Appreciate it, but I'd rather go through the regular channels. Also, I'm using Daisy Stanley here, so let's keep it that way."


Jennifer looked confused for a second but nodded anyway. "Alright, noted. Let me know if you need anything!"


"Will do." Arabella gave a polite nod and walked out without another word.


Not long after, Zoe strolled in.



"Good morning! I brought you something to eat,"she said, grinning sweetly.


Jennifer didn't react much at first but then raised a brow. "Zoe, you're one of the instructors at the university,right?"


"Sure I am. Why?" Zoe replied, curious.


Jennifer's tone turned pointed. "You've got
someone special in your batch. Don't let her slip through the cracks-she's worth watching."


Zoe's face lit up. "Of course. I've got my eye on her-she's going to steal the spotlight at the next show," she said smoothly.


Over in the rehearsal space, the fill-ins were pushing hard, trying to nail their moves.


But for Arabella, it was child's play-she was dancing to her own blueprint.


When break time rolled around, the dancers grabbed water and noticed Elissa soaking up the spotlight, chatting with the core team like a celebrity.


"Elissa, that move earlier? So smooth! Mind showing us again?"


Elissa grinned confidently. "Sure thing."


She jumped right into her freestyle, not missing a beat.



Her moves were sharp and full of flair, and the crowd ate it up, cheering and applauding.


"She's legit. I haven't seen anyone with that kind of range in ages."


"Looks like the new generation's here to rule!"
Just then, Zoe walked up with an easy smile."Elissa, you're getting noticed! Ms. Dawson couldn't stop praising you-keep it up!"


Elissa's face lit up. "Wait, seriously?"


Jennifer wasn't just any official. She was one of Scainia's elite dancers.


So getting her nod meant a lot.


The rest of the dancers couldn't help but watch her with a mix of awe and envy-it was like Elissa just leveled up in front of everyone.
###Chapter 17 You're Not Even Competition
Arabella's partner noticed her gaze and gave her a light elbow. "Stop staring. We're nowhere near their league. The pros have talent and serious hookups. Elissa's on another level-she's young and already made it into the Griridge Troupe. Her dancing's sharp, and her routines? Next level."


"Seriously? She's got those freestyle parts figured out already?" Arabella asked, sounding mildly interested.


"That's what sets her apart. There's a solo section where we have to freestyle, and while we're all still piecing things together, she's already nailed hers. See that part there?" Her partner let out a sigh. "Everyone's so polished.I'm probably stuck in the background for life."


She looked totally defeated, like she had accepted being a forever backup.


Arabella didn't say a word.


"Daisy?" Elissa's voice rang out as she approached with a syrupy smile. "Hey, Daisy!Glad you're here. Are you holding up alright? I was honestly worried the training might be a bit much since it's been a while since you danced."


Everyone turned to look at Arabella. One dancer mumbled, "Wait, she's been out of it for that long?"


Whispers started flying-how did someone who hadn't danced in ages end up as a substitute?


Elissa gave a dramatic gasp, covering her mouth."Oops, that came out wrong! Daisy's got a leg condition, but it's no big deal-she can still dance just fine!"


The more she explained, the more annoyed people looked.


She had barely trained and had a leg issue, but she still made it in? That smelled like favoritism.


To them, nothing stung more than someone getting ahead through connections instead of effort.


One of them rolled their eyes and walked away.


A few others just gave dirty looks and turned their backs.


Arabella didn't panic. Instead,she smirked a little."Well played, Elissa. You've got them all buying whatever you're selling again."
Elissa was smug inside, but her voice was full of fake guilt. "Aw, I didn't mean to cause a scene.I'll watch my words next time, I swear."


"It's fine. It's kind of your signature move-slip-ups that always end up hurting me," Arabella replied evenly. "No need to apologize. But you might want to think twice, since throwing shade at me means doubting Jennifer's decision too."


Elissa's smile twitched for just a moment,her mask slipping.


Arabella's partner finally spoke up. "I danced with her. She's actually incredible, okay?"


Everyone turned to look at Elissa again, this time with more doubt in their eyes.


Her hands started to sweat, but she stuck to playing the innocent. "It was an honest mistake!You really think I'd go out of my way to mess with you? C'mon,Daisy-you're not even competition."


Zoe jumped in right away. "Yeah, Daisy, get over yourself. Not everyone's plotting against you."


Elissa gave a shake of her head, acting like she was hurt, then turned and walked off.



The rest trailed after her, glancing back at Daisy with a mix of judgment and uncertainty.
Arabella's partner turned to her with concern written all over her face. "Are youalright,Daisy?"


Arabella looked at her calmly. "What's your name,by the way?"


"Karlie Alford."



"Nice," Arabella replied, her tone cool. "You aiming for the main squad?"


Karlie was taken aback.



***



With the showcase getting closer, everyone threw themselves into practice once the break ended.



After a long, tiring session, thesubstitute dancers slowly packed up and left,drained.


Only Arabella and Karlie stayed behind.


"I'll show you how it's done."


Arabella danced the whole routine smoothly for Karlie to watch.


Once she was done, Karlie stood frozen,her mouth hanging open.

Arabella hadn't been showing her fulI potential before. What she just did made the main team look average.
"Stop spacing out. Get moving!" Arabella's sharp voice jolted Karlie back to reality.


Snapping out of it, she dove right into practice,pushing herself to match Arabella's drive.


Even though they were both exhausted, Karlie didn't let up. She was locked in, totally focused.


Watching Karlie give it her all made Arabella think of Daisy-she must HAve pushed herself just as hard.



"Still going,huh?"


Suddenly, Elissa's voice rang out from the doorway.


She strolled in slowly, her smile twisted and mean now that they were alone. "Train all you want,Daisy, but it won't change a thing. Losers stay losers. If hard work really worked, talent wouldn't matter."


"Oh, so you're pure talent now?" Arabella said,tilting her head with a sarcastic grin.


Karlie looked stunned. She hadn't expected Elissa to be this nasty.
###Chapter 18 Are You Wearing Perfume
Elissa shot Karlie a quick, dismissive look before locking eyes with Arabella. "Compared to you?Yeah, I'm the real talent here."


"Elissa, why are you wasting time over here?" A tall woman walked up, barely glancing at the other two as she focused on Elissa. "Let's go. We need to finalize your routine."


"Great!" Elissa beamed and walked with her."Wait, are you serious? They're actually choosing my choreography?"


"For sure," Lailah Stevenson responded, flashing her a proud smile. "Everyone loved what you came up with. Just a heads-up though-don't get too cozy with the backup dancers. I get that you're nice and all, but those girls are dying to steal your spot."


"Understood."



Lailah wasn't exactly keeping her voice down, and both girls heard every word. Karlie's hands curled into fists, but she stayed quiet and focused on practicing with Arabella.
At Griridge Troupe, only raw talent mattered.Backup dancers like Karlie were always made to feel like they didn't belong.


Karlie understood she had to work twice as hard just to be noticed.


Later that evening, under a clear night sky, Karlie and Arabella walked out of the theater. Right across the street was Griridge's fancy mall, still alive with stylish folks showing off their high-end bags and expensive watches.


As they crossed the street, Arabella happened to catch sight of Lailah.


"Hey, isn't that our team lead?" Karlie exclaimed,surprised.


Arabella glanced over casually, not paying much attention-until she saw a tall man dressed in black, his suit blending into the shadows. There was something cold and intimidating about him.


"Asher? What's he doing here?" Arabella wondered silently.


"Who's the gguy with her?" Karlie asked. "He's cute. Is that her boyfriend? Ugh, rich people always end up with each other."


"Nope," Arabella replied flatly, not missing a beat.
Even from where she stood, she could clearly make out what Lailah was saying.


"Hey, handsome. I've been watching you," Lailah said with a flirty wink, oozing confidence. "How about we trade numbers?"


With her beauty and charm, Lailah was certain she would reel him in.


Asher slowly took a drag from his cigarette, the way his sharp jawline stood out and his piercing eyes cut through the darkness making him impossible to ignore. He had that cold and distant vibe. Even Lailah, who had been around wealthy and powerful men before, was taken aback. No one came close to his presence.


"This guy's the ultimate trophy," Lailah thought smugly.


But Asher didn't say a word and just left her hanging in the silence.


"Wow, not bad. He's got guts," she thought.



Lailah let out a playful giggle as she slid out her business card and reached for Asher's suit pocket.


But before she could get close, Asher's eyes turned sharp, carrying a cold, dangerous edge.
However, just then, Arabella stepped in, snatched the card, and slipped it right back into Lailah's pocket.


Lailah whirled around, clearly annoyed, only to come face-to-face with Arabella.



In a calm but pointed tone, Arabella said, "He's married, just so you know."


Lailah's expression soured, her pride taking a hit,especially since Asher didn't say a word in her defense. Getting called out by Arabella in front of him felt like a slap to her ego.


"Seriously? You could've said that sooner," Lailah huffed, spinning on her heel. "What a total waste of time."



Not far off, Dominick came rushing over, clearly relieved. "Miss Stanley, thank you. That could've gone real bad."


He knew Asher's patience for nonsense was non-existent. If Arabella hadn't stepped in, Lailah might have seriously regretted her little stunt.


"What are you guys doing out here?" Arabella asked,totally unbothered.


"Mr. Gordon just wanted to get a look around.What about you, Miss Stanley? Late night stroll?"
"Just on my way back home," she said.


"Let me call a ride for you," Dominick offered,pulling out his phone.


After all, Asher's father had made it clear-Arabella came first.



But before he could dial, Asher spoke up. "Get in."


Dominick blinked, surprised. Since when did Asher let anyone ride with him? He usually hated sharing his space.


Arabella, however, didn't question it, and she simply got in.


Inside the spacious, luxurious car, Asher's presence was commanding. But Arabella stayed calm and collected. "Thanks for the bedsheet last time," she said casually.


Asher glanced at her. "Don't mention it. So, you know when you're moving in yet?"


Arabella gave a small, tight smile. She knew this wasn't about kindness-it was obligation. As long as he checked in and saw her and her sister were okay,he would be in the clear with his dad.



"I'm going to wait a bit," she replied softly.


"Alright." He leaned back with his eyes closed,
the soft light tracing the sharp angles of his face,casting a light shadow under his lashes.


As he relaxed, a calming scent reached him. It wasn't strong,just soft and pleasant.


"Way better than those strong perfumes," he thought.


He opened one eye and asked in a low voice,"Are you wearing perfume?"


Arabella looked a bit confused. "Nope. Probably just my laundry soap. It smells kinda nice,though."


Noticing the dark circles under his eyes, she took a small sachet from her bag and held it out. "You like the scent? It works great in your room. Helps you sleep better."


Asher stared at it, unmoving.


In the front seat, Dominick cringed. Arabella had no idea Asher wasn't the type to accept things from others.


"Miss Stanley, I could use some sleep help too..."Dominick tried to jump in, hoping to ease the tension. But before he could finish,Asher reached out and took the sachet.
###Chapter 19 Don't Just Stand Around!
The sachet felt unexpectedly soft in Asher's hand, almost delicate, nothing like he had expected.


Arabella turned toward Dominick with a small smile. "Do you want one too? Here," she said,passing him another sachet from her bag.


Dominick accepted it gratefully, giving it a cautious sniff. The subtle scent washed over him like a calming breeze. "Didn't know you had a talent for this kind of stuff, Miss Stanley."


Arabella gave a relaxed shrug. "Try it out. It's better than counting sheep."


A few quiet moments later, the car pulled up outside the hospital. Arabella grabbed her things and gave the two men a little wave. "Thanks for the ride," she said, stepping out without hesitation.


Dominick was still toying with the sachet, visibly impressed. "This thing's legit. Seriously, it's relaxing as hell."


Asher glanced at the sachet in Dominick's hand without saying a word, but his stare was so sharp
it made Dominick uneasy. Trusting his gut,Dominick quickly offered it. "I don't really need it anyway," he said with a nervous chuckle. "You should have it, boss. Doesn't it help you sleep better?"


Asher slowly shut his eyes. "She gave it to you.Keep it."


Dominick sheepishly pulled it back.


He couldn't stop thinking about it-ever since Arabella came into the picture, his boss had been acting strange. Not in a bad way, just... not like himself.


Over the next few days, Arabella threw herself into rehearsals like a machine, giving every ounce of energy she had to the Griridge Troupe.


One evening, the whole troupe gathered at a nearby diner for a casual team dinner.


Even the substitute dancers were invited, and Lailah wasted no time pulling Arabella into the booth beside her.


She leaned in, lowering her voice. "Big-time investor's dropping in tonight. We need someone who turns heads, and that's you and me. You know how this goes. Our troupe's hot, but money talks. You work your charm, girl, and you're
golden. I'm giving you a real shot here because I know you've got the spark."


Arabella's gaze sharpened, but she offered a sly,easy smile. "How generous of you, Lailah. I appreciate the opportunity."


Lailah grinned, clearly pleased with herself.


Soon after, their guest of honor arrived.


A bulky man in an overstretched suit waddled in,his eyes lighting up the second he saw Arabella."Whoa, I didn't know your troupe had such stunners! No wonder Griridge Troupe's name is everywhere!"


"You bet," Lailah said, chuckling. "Meet Daisy.Daisy, this is Mr. Trace Burke."


Trace extended a thick hand. "Even your name's pretty. You're a total bombshell!"


Arabella gave a calm smile and raised her soda."Nice to meet you,Mr.Burke.Cheers."


His hand hovered for a second, but once he saw Arabella take a sip, he picked up his own glass and took a drink too.



Arabella kept casually clinking glasses with Trace,smoothly dodging any of his touches. After a while, he got totally drunk, and when he couldn't
hold back anymore, he clumsily reached for her knee.


A loud scream rang out, making everyone look over.


Arabella's water glass spilled, splashing all over Trace's hand, turning it bright red.


Lailah snapped, her voice sharp. "Daisy, what the hell was that?"


"My bad," Arabella responded calmly, as if nothing serious had happened. "Didn't mean to spill it."


The rest of the group exchanged quick glances,clearly piecing together what just happened.


Trace's reputation wasn't news. Most in the troupe knew he was sleazy, and more than a few were disgusted.


"Don't just stand around!" Lailah barked at Arabella. "Get Mr. Burke back to his room already!"


Trace muttered something under his breath and pushed back his chair. "Whatever. I'm heading out.Walk me."


Arabella's brows lifted, amused. "Sure thing," she said,striding out behind him.
Back at the table, a sharp glint flashed in Lallan's eyes. This was working out better than she had hoped. Let Arabella charm her way in, for now.Once everyone bought into the act, she could flip the script, tarnish her reputation, and toss her out without anyone batting an eye.


Lailah took a slow sip of her wine, smiling like she had already won.



Meanwhile, out in the hallway, Trace's self-control was long gone. Reeking of alcohol and entitlement, he staggered toward Arabella,grabbing at her. "You're hot stuff, babe. Stick with me, and I'll make sure you're Griridge's next star."


Arabella slipped to the side, dodging his touch with ease. "Is that so? And what's your brilliant plan for making that happen?"


Trace's face was flushed deep red, stinking of whiskey.He grinned lazily. "Easy stuff. I'll get you into the main team and right under the spotlight.No sweat."


Arabella rolled her eyes. "Please. You can't fake talent. Making it to the top squad is hard enough -being front and center's a whole dlifferent game."


The smirk on Trace's face twitched. He clearly
didn't like being challenged. "You've got the skills," he said, trying to recover. "You think the main team's all that? Lailah? She'd be nothing if it weren't for me."
###Chapter 20 Don't Ever Come Near Us
Again




"What the hell is wrong with you? You don't get to disrespect our leader like that!" Arabella snapped,her cheeks blazing with fake anger.


Trace let out a filthy chuckle. "You think Lailah's a big deal? l've lost track of how often she's warmed my bed."


Arabella's stomach turned. "So that's how it is,"she muttered. "She slept her way there."


"What was that?" Trace murmured, his eyes gleaming with sick desire as he staggered toward Arabella. But she didn't flinch. With an icy glare,she drove her foot into his gut, sending him slamming into the stairwell door with a loud thud.


"You disgusting creep," she hissed. "Touch me again, and I swear you'll regret it."


The jolt of pain snapped Trace out of his drunken haze, but her words only made him angrier."You bitch," he barked. "You think you can talk to me like that? I'm the one footing the bill for your precious troupe!"
Arabella didn't blink. "Then we're done. Don't ever come near us again."


"You... you ungrateful cunt!" Trace shouted,trembling with fury. But with his weight and the liquor clouding his system, all he could do was stay slumped on the floor. Arabella didn't even glance back as she walked away, calm and composed. Gritting his teeth, Trace scrambled for his phone, punching in a number with shaky fingers.


Once the call ended, a sick grin spread across Trace's face.


In his mind, it was only a matter of time before Arabella crawling back, begging for mercy.


Suddenly, a hand clamped down on his arm and yanked him upright with zero effort. He blinked,disoriented."Who the hell are you?" he slurred.


"Did I just catch the name Daisy Stanley?"Dominick asked, flashing him a laid-back smile.


Trace narrowed his eyes. "You know her or something?"


"Sounds like she's the one who kicked your ass,"he replied, half amused.


He remembered Daisy was still in the hospital, so
that meant Arabella did the damage.


Trace scratched his temple, baffled by how casually this stranger had appeared and now walked off.


Dominick had just been out for dinner with some friends. He hadn't expected this but figured it wouldn't hurt to give Asher a heads-up.


Then again, he doubted if his boss would even care enough to respond.


Given that Trace looked pathetic and didn't harm Arabella, he doubted Asher would bother to avenge her.


After all, Asher was only watching over Arabella because his father told him to.


Dominick shrugged, tossed his phone back on the table, and dug into his food.


But just as he took another bite, the phone rang.






Inside the private dining room, the atmosphere crackled with excitement.


Lailah leaned back with a smug grin, fully convinced that Trace had already had his way with Arabella and probably had some photos to
back it up.


The thought of wiping out that annoying thorn in her side lifted her mood instantly. But then,Jeffrey Barlow's phone rang. The agent's expression shifted as he listened, his face slowly losing all color. "Wait... what? Are you serious?How did that even happen?"


The whole room froze. All eyes locked on him.


Jeffrey wasn't one to lose his cool. If he looked rattled, it had to be huge.


He ended the call with a death grip on his phone."Our funding just got pulled. Mr. Burke's done.He's not investing another dime."


The mood flipped. Every face in the room turned pale.


"What the hell is going on? Wasn't he always backing us? He's invested so many times!"


"We do so much charity work. We've got a clean name. Are we supposed to charge now and throw that all away?"


Even Lailah looked shaken. "Hang on-wasn't Daisy the last one with him?" she blurted.


And as if on cue, Arabella walked back in like nothing had happened.
Lailah's eyes narrowed to slits. "Daisy, what the hell did you do? Mr. Burke just bailed on us! I told you he was our main backer-are you trying to ruin everything?"


Jeffrey looked furious as he snapped at Arabella."You're part of this troupe,yet you act like some reckless outsider!"


Lailah turned stone cold. "If you're this ungrateful,then leave. We don't need chaos dressed in sequins."


Elissa sighed and shook her head. "Daisy...you've really gone too far. Just go before this turns uglier."


The room split-many glared at Arabella, but a few knew deep down that Trace was the real problem.


Karlie mumbled quietly, "It doesn't make sense. If Mr. Burke really wanted to support us, why'd he pull out so fast?"


Lailah overheard and fired back sharply, "You backup dancers really don't get how this troupe works, do you? We're the ones grinding every day for that funding. Who do you think covers your paycheck and pays for those fancy outfits?"


"Can't you fill-ins care just once?" another dancer
snapped,rolling her eyes.



Tension thickened across the room

phone buzzed again.



He answered, and his face changed completely

"Vanguard Group? Are you serious?"
###Chapter 21 Be More Cautious Next Time
Jeffrey let out a laugh. "Okay, okay, I get the picture."



Once he ended the call, a jolt of excitement buzzed through him. "I just heard from Mr.Powell. He's the CEO's right-hand man at Vanguard Group. They want to invest in us!"



"No way!" The group could hardly believe it.Vanguard Group completely outclassed Trace's firm by miles.



Flashing a grin, Jeffrey confirmed, "It's absolutely legit, and we owe this one to-"



He glanced over at Arabella before he continued, "Daisy. Turns out, Mr. Powell said Daisy once did their CEO a favor, and now they're convinced our troupe is truly something special."



A heavy silence swept through the room.



But Karlie couldn't hide her delight as she gazed at Arabella. "Daisy, you're incredible! You just
saved all of us!"



"Honestly, she just got lucky." Lailah chimed in as a wave of jealousy and resentment washed over her. How did a backup dancer end up holding this much power over everyone? "Let's not forget, I was the one who introduced Mr.Burke, and he's been our biggest supporter for years."



"And thanks to your efforts, Lailah, every one of us faced sexual harassment," Arabella answered, her voice was cool and unbothered.



Her statement got right to the point.



Everyone knew Trace had crossed the line with more than a few of them.



Lailah's cheeks went pale. "That's outrageous!What are you talking about?"



Just as she finished speaking, her phone buzzed.She read the message,her expression tightening,and quickly got up to leave.



Arabella wasn't the least bit surprised as Lailah stormed out.



She slid into the seat next to Karlie,who looked
at her with a mix of admiration and envy. "Daisy,we all owe you for what you did. Honestly, Mr.Burke made me so uncomfortable-I hated it!"



"I feel the same." A backup dancer spoke up next, her voice quiet but steady. "He tried the same thing with me. His position made it impossible to say anything, but I couldn't stand it."



Another chimed in, echoing their frustration,"I still don't understand how Lailah convinced him to invest in us. Honestly, there were moments l wanted to quit the troupe for good."



One by one, everyone started voicing their complaints.



It was clear the entire group had grown weary of Trace's actions.



Meanwhile, just outside the room, Lailah's face twisted with anger as she whispered into her phone. "You still haven't found out who sent that tip?"



A voice replied, "No, but I've managed to keep things quiet for now. Be more cautious next time."
"Okay, I'll take care of it." Lailah ended the call,though anxiety still lingered in her chest.



Someone had actually reported her relationship with Trace to the Dance Association.



Thank goodness her friend there had helped smooth things over.



Still, she couldn't shake the question. Who would dare turn her in?



Agitated, Lailah approached the door and overheard everyone inside, their voices full of resentment toward Trace. Her mood darkened even more.



Had she never secured Trace's investment,would the troupe have made it this far?



Not a single one of them seemed grateful for her efforts.



Furious, Lailah stomped her foot, made up her mind not to return, and marched away without looking back.



That marked the end of the dinner.
One by one, the group dispersed.


Arabella decided to head back to the hospital.


Just then, her phone buzzed with a call from Joshua. "Have you already handled things with Mr. Burke? I was about to step in myself, bout suddenly, his company's facing a setback."


Arabella shook her head, confused. "I didn't do anything. Maybe karma finally caught up with him."


Joshua replied thoughtfully,"Yeah, maybe."


Once she got back to the hospital, Arabella couldn't help but look into Trace's company.To her surprise, it was facing attacks from every direction. Her eyes narrowed. This didn't look like a simple setback. Someone clearly wanted to see him wiped out.


While the Burke Group wasn't one of the industry giants, it had been around for years.Only a real heavyweight could take it down so fast.
Just as Arabella thought over the situation,someone walked in.



Arabella glanced up and recognized Asher.



Dressed in an all-black suit and carrying an air as cold as midnight, he seemed almost unapproachable.



It didn't take Arabella long to put the pieces together. "You're the one who went after the Burke Group, aren't you?"



Asher looked genuinely taken aback, his gaze lingering on Arabella. "You catch on quickly."



Arabella shrugged. "It's not about being clever.Only someone with your resources could've managed something likethis. But what do you have against the Burke Group?"



With a cold edge to his voice, Asher responded,"Dominick said Trace Burke tried something with you.Is that true?"



His eyes searched Arabella for any sign of physical injury.
"I'm all right," Arabella assured him,though her feelings were mixed. "I appreciate what you did,but I'm not someone who needs rescuing."



Asher had to be tied up with work.


Arabella didn't want to be a burden, especially since there was no real bond between them.



Asher's expression grew thoughtful for a moment.Then he replied, "It didn't take much.Besides, I heard a company is already planning to invest in your troupe."



Arabella nodded. "That's right."


Without another word, Asher turned to leave.


"Hold on." Arabella moved quickly to catch up."I'll walk you out."


Asher accepted her offer without hesitation.


As they walked, Arabella finally asked the question that had been weighing on her."Would you mind telling me about your father and mine?"
###Chapter 22 I've Still Got Dirt On You
Asher looked over at Arabella, taking note of just how on guarded she was. He lowered his voice as he said, "My father and yours met during their time in the military. They actually got along really well."


"So, what happened after that?"


"I really don't know," said Asher.


Arabella couldn't find any words to respond.


The pair stepped into the elevator. As soon as it started going down, Arabella's senses told her right away that something was off.


A moment later, darkness swallowed the elevator,and everything stopped moving.


Calmly,Arabella leaned her back against the wall and said, "Looks like the elevator stopped working."


The silence felt heavy, and she could hear Asher's breathing turning ragged. She took a step closer,picking up on his labored breaths, and immediately realized that he struggled with tight spaces.
Keeping her voice steady, Arabella assured him,"Don't worry. This isn't a big deal. Someone will get it fixed soon."


Asher made a soft sound to show he heard her,and quiet settled over them again.


She could still feeI his anxiety hanging in the air.After a brief pause, she broke the silence. "Can you tell me how your dad died?"


His answer came out cold. "There were a lot of things left unfinished when he was in the military."


Her response was gentle, carrying a touch of longing. "I understand. The military seems to leave a lot of open wounds. My father went through the same thing."


Her words grew softer. "He died so unexpectedly."


Silence followed. Suddenly, his hand clamped around Arabella's wrist, and sharp pain shot up her arm.


His hold tightened, as if he was ready to crush every bone in her wrist.


What was happening wasn't claustrophobia. It was something far more dangerous, an explosive disorder.
So far, he had mahaged to keep i unuei but just barely.


Arabella reached over and placed her hand on his. The familiar scent drifted toward Asher once again. For reasons he couldn't explain, his emotions slowly settled, and the storm of anger inside him faded away.


Repairs at the hospital happened quickly. What happened in the elevator was nothing more than a minor hiccup. A moment later, the lights in the elevator flickered back, and they soon reached the parking level.


Glancing at Asher, Arabella saw that his face had returned to its usual calm, almost detached look.He let go of her hand with slow movements,and red marks stood out clearly on her slender wrist.


He parted his lips, looking as if he was about to say something.


Without missing a beat, Arabella tucked her hand into her pocket. "How do you like the sachet I gave you?"


"It's good," he said.


A thought crossed her mind, and she spoke up. "I remembered something that might help you sleep even better. Next time, I'll bring it for you. Thank
you for looking out for me these days."


Not a word left Asher's mouth. He gave a quiet nod.


Without another glance, Asher made his way to his car, while Arabella turned back toward the elevator.


Once he got behind the wheel, he picked up the sachet out of habit. The gentle fragrance filled the inside of the car.


For a long time, Asher kept his eyes fixed on the small pouch in his hand.



Arabella returned to the hospital room and saw the unconscious Daisy. Soon after, she let herself drift off to sleep.


A few days went by with nothing but dance practice. Before long, it was time to head back to school for regular classes.


Morning came, and Arabella arrived at Griridge University with a small thrill of excitement.


Finally, Joyce came back to class after her absence. Her injuries had not fully healed, and her face was still bruised. The second she spotted Arabella, her piercing eyes locked onto her.
The air in the classroom felt heavy, and everyone kept their voices low.


During lunchtime, Joyce and her group cornered Arabella against the wall.


With her arms folded, Arabella leaned back and met Joyce's stare with a faint, mysterious smile.



"So, what can I do for you?" Arabella asked in a tone much softer than usual.


Joyce fixed her stare on Arabella. There was no way she would risk going head-to-head with Daisy, and violence was out of the question.Instead, she looked stubborn. "I've still got dirt on you.Want to see what it is?"


A cold look flashed in Arabella's eyes. She already knew what Joyce meant.


Seeing the sudden shift in Arabella's expression,Joyce wavered for a second, but then her face brightened with excitement. "Looks like you already figured it out. Here's the deal-this is your final shot. If you beg for my forgiveness and start doing what I say, I'll keep it to myself. How about that?"


Kenzie interjected, "Joyce is cutting you a break.You should really take it. Do you want everyone to see you naked online?"
A sudden burst of laughter escaped Arabella. "Go ahead.Let everyone see."


Without looking back, Arabella walked away.


Total disbelief washed over Joyce. "Is she out of her mind?"


Kenzie couldn't make sense of it either. Her nerves started to fray. "Maybe she's calling our bluff. What if she thinks we're not serious?"


"Then let's post it right now," Joyce replied, her voice ice-cold.


Without waiting another moment, she uploaded the video of Daisy being stripped to the Internet.


Watching the clip, she felt a bit of her anger from the recent fight melt away, and laughter bubbled up from her chest. Kenzie joined in, her laugh echoing Joyce's. "She'll be at our feet soon enough."


"Obviously," Joyce said, now feeling a wave of satisfaction. With a quick glance at Kenzie,she ordered, "What are you waiting for? Go grab me some lunch."


Kenzie didn't hesitate. "You got it." She darted off toward the cafeteria.


Inside the crowded cafeteria, people gathered
over their meals.


All around, Joyce could hear students whispering about the video.


"Whoa... I never realized she looked that good."


"Unbelievable! Has anyone told her she's gone viral?"
###Chapter 23 Have You Checked The Video Online


Upon overhearing the crowd, Joyce burst out laughing as she settled in at the table with her friends.


Kenzie said, "Everyone's talking about that video -I keep hearing it everywhere!"


Taking a sip from her cola, Joyce grinned, her spirits high. "I know, right? At this rate, Daisy won't even show up around here anymore."


A fresh laugh escaped Kenzie. "Honestly! Did she really think we'd keep it to ourselves?"


The thought crossed Kenzie's mind that if Arabella hadn't quit following their lead, she would probably be the one running errands now.


That resentment toward Arabella lingered in Kenzie's mind.



In that moment, Joyce's phone suddenly rang.


A voice came through the line. "Joyce, have you checked the video online?" Elissa asked.



A loud laugh left Joyce as she replied, "So you
saw it too? Has the dance troupe found out? Is Daisy about to get kicked out?"


Elissa didn't answer right away. After a brief silence, she urged, "Just look at it now!"


With nothing more to say, Elissa ended the call.


Confusion flickered on Joyce's face, but her curiosity won out and she quickly pulled up the video she had uploaded.


The sight on her screen made every muscle in Joyce's body freeze.


What she saw wasn't Daisy at all; it was her own face.


She had checked the video over and over before posting. She could have sworn it was Daisy in the footage. None of it made sense.


A wave of panic crashed through Joyce as the sounds of gossip surrounded her, growing louder with every second.


All the whispers and side conversations were suddenly about her.


Joyce clung to hope as she turned to Kenzie."Kenzie, you saw the video before I posted it,didn't you? That was Daisy, right?" Her whole body was shaking.
Kenzie looked just as stunned. "Yeah, I did,but...

how did things end uplike this?"


A loud cry burst from Joyce. "Oh my God!"



She shoved the table away with a sudden kick,her hands trembling as she hurried to delete the video. Her eyes turned red from holding back tears. Glancing around at her classmates, all frozen in shock, she ran out of the cafeteria in a frenzy.


By then, the video had already attracted thousands of views.


Joyce's mind refused to accept it as a simple mistake.


There had to be someone behind it.



She made up her mind to head to the company and talk to the programmers herself.


Kenzie sat there in a daze, the shock refusing to let her relax.



Right before the afternoon classes, Kenzie spotted Arabella sitting alone on a chair.



Sunlight poured over Arabella, and she tilted her face up, her delicate features striking Kenzie once again.
It brought Kenzie back to those days when Daisy had first started at school. Back then, she was beautiful and full of life, but Joyce's bullying had snuffed out her spark.


Now, Daisy looked more dazzling than ever, her confidence shining bright.


A feeling of anger slowly crept into Kenzie's chest.


Both of them came from families with little money,but Daisy's beauty seemed untouched by her struggles.


Breaking the silence, Kenzie sat beside Arabella."Daisy," she said, her voice serious, "was this your doing? I know you can't stand Joyce,but you do realize she's the Lambert Group CEO's only child, right? She's out of reach for people like us,just like Elissa. There's nothing we can do to change that."


Arabella didn't lift her eyes from the pages of her book. She gave no sign she had heard Kenzie at all.


Kenzie added, "Getting on Joyce's bad side means making enemies with all the elite. Kenny Hyde is her boyfriend, and her whole group is nothing but wealthy girls from powerful families.
When you're out there looking for a job after graduation, people like them will block your way.You'll run into trouble at every turn. I'm not trying to scare you. I just want you to think about your future."


A sudden chill colored Arabella's words as she finally spoke. "So, if I want a future, I have to join in on picking on other people?"


Her cold stare sent an uneasy shiver through Kenzie.



Anger welled up in Kenzie. "I'm only looking out for you, but you don't appreciate it. Next time those girls go after you, don't expect me to help out."


She let out a sharp laugh. "Joyce is in deep trouble now, thanks to you. You'd better be ready for whatever payback she comes up with!"


No reaction showed on Arabella's face.



If Joyce wanted to make things difficult, she was ready for it. She almost hoped things would get even more chaotic.


Her thoughts proved right. Once classes ended and Arabella reached the front gate, a luxury car rolled to a stop beside her.
Two bodyguards stepped out and moved in her direction. Their tone was cold and commanding."Miss Stanley, come with us. Mrs. Lambert wants to speak with you."


There was nothing friendly about their invitation.


The students nearby watched the scene unfold,quickly making way. They whispered among themselves as Arabella climbed into the car.


"Do you think Daisy's in trouble?"


"The Lambert family has ties to some shady people. She might be in real danger."


"Will Daisy come back after this?"


Sitting inside the car, Arabella found herself surrounded by bodyguards. She kept one hand on her phone in her pocket, subtly tapping at it.Suddenly, a bodyguard reached over and pulled her hand away. "Don't move!"


Without a word, Arabella leaned back and shut her eyes, choosing to rest.


A frown creased the bodyguard's face.


He couldn't figure her out. How could she stay so calm? Did she know what probably waited for her?
###Chapter 24 Feeling Scared Now
About thirty minutes later, the bodyguards brought Arabella straight into the Lambert family's estate.


Sounds of weeping drifted toward her before she even reached the living room.



Between sobs, Joyce begged, "Mom, she really went too far. You'll get rid of everything for me,right?"


Trying to soothe her daughter, Maryam Lambert answered, "Don't worry, Joyce. Everything's been wiped clean. Imagine, just a young girl, yet she had the nerve to go after you."


Maryam's words dripped with venom.


As Arabella stepped into the living room, she spotted Joyce and Maryam seated on the couch.



Sitting next to Joyce, a woman with striking cheekbones and a commanding presence looked Arabella up and down. The coldness in her eyes left no doubt that she felt above her. Her words were biting. "This is Daisy Stanley?"


Joyce responded without missing a beat, a mix of
pride and scorn in her voice. "Yes, that's her!"


With deliberate movements, Maryam picked up a leather whip and strode toward Arabella.



Joyce felt a thrill rush through her chest.


Her mother was no ordinary figure in their world.



Plus, inside these walls, Daisy had nowhere to run.


Thick leather wrapped around the whip. Just a single lash would easily break the skin.


Maryam spoke in a condescending tone."You arrogant little bitch. Get down on your knees."



Arabella refused to move, her glare as cold as ever.


Something about Arabella's reaction gave Maryam pause. Years of dealing wth powerful people had made her a force to be reckoned with,but this girl wasn't the least bit intimidated.


Without another word, Maryam raised the whip,ready to strike.



Right then, Arabella broke her silence. "Mrs.Lambert, do you have any idea what Joyce has really done?"
Maryam's hand froze in the air, and Arabella began to list each of Joyce's vicious acts. "She and Elissa broke my leg, forced me out of my clothes in the restroom, led the others in tormenting me, even burned my skin with a curling iron..."


Each word came out steady and cold as Arabella named every awful thing done to her.


Maryam listened, then slowly lowered the whip. A harsh sneer twisted her lips. "And what if she did?"



The look in Maryam's eyes was blank and uncaring as she addressed Arabella, saying, "You really believe Joyce is why you're in this mess?You're wrong. It's because of who you are and who your parents are. If you were born into wealth, nothing like this would ever happen. Our family earned its status through hard work, and people like you are just here for our amusement.Even if Joyce ended your life right now, nobody would dare to stop her."


Her voice dripped with venom and contempt.


From her seat, Joyce crossed her legs, smug and satisfied.



Arabella dropped her gaze.
Maryam sneered, "Feeling scared now? It always takes pain to teach fools a lesson."


A faint smile crossed Arabella's lips as she raised her head. "Joyce hasn't faced any consequences herself, but her compromising video is already all over the Internet. Everyone's seen her naked by now."


Rage flashed across Maryam's face. "You little bitch!" she screamed, whipping the air furiously.



Arabella leaped aside, but the bodyguards moved in without hesitation, grabbing hold of her.


These men were the best, handpicked for their strength and loyalty.


Arabella fought to break free, dodging most of the blows, but still ended up with a harsh mark on her arm.



A flash of metal sliced through the air as Arabella stepped away from danger. Her necklace swung up, and the blade sliced clean through the chain.A crisp clatter echoed when the jewelry hit the floor.


If the pendant snapped open, it would expose a photo of Arabella with Daisy inside.


A spark of determination lit up Arabella's eyes.
She fought off a bodyguard with quick force,knocking him down and darting forward to snatch her necklace. Before she could pick it up, a stiletto heel smashed down on the pendant,shattering it in an instant.


Heartache flared through Arabella, sharp and sudden.



Maryam's voice rang out, dripping with scorn."Seems like the more worthless a person's life is,the harder they cling to it."


For a moment, Arabella stood frozen. That pause gave the bodyguards their opening. Several of them lunged forward and pinned her in place.



A glare burned in Maryam's eyes as she swung the whip, her voice harsh. "You filthy cunt, you deserve to die!"


Right before the whip struck, a sudden pain tore through Maryam's chest as a thin needle embedded itself in her skin. Agony raced through her, and she crashed to the floor, clutching her chest as the pain spread.


Joyce jumped up in a panic to help her mother. In that same moment, a group of men dressed in black stormed through the doors.


The room exploded into chaos as the boodyguards
fought with thenewcomers.Butsoon, the bodyguards quickly lost ground. Joyce backed away, frantically calling her father. "Dad... Dad,you have to help us!"


Arabella managed to fire just one needle before the men in black whisked her away.


She hurried to scoop up every piece of her broken pendant as she was led out.


Inside the waiting black car, Arabella took her seat and blinked in shock when she saw Asher.



She stared at him and asked, "Why are you here?"
###Chapter 25 I've Arranged A Place For You
A sharp look crossed Asher's face. "Who else did you expect?"


Arabella pulled out her phone. She meant to send a message to Joshua, but when she opened her messages, Asher's name appeared at the top because she had just received a text from him.Without realizing it, she sent her location to Asher instead.


"At the Lambert family's house."


That brief message was all she had managed to send, yet it was enough to send Asher hurrying straight to her side.


A glance at her arm made Asher's brow tighten.


"You're hurt." He took her wrist in his hand,quickly spotting the wounds. Without a moment's delay, he instructed Dominick, "Head for the hospital."


As soon as the car moved, Arabella's hand relaxed, and the broken photo pieces slipped into view. Tears welled up in her eyes.
Noticing both the fragments and the tears in her eyes, Asher pressed his lips into a thin line and kept quiet.


Several silent seconds passed before he finally spoke, his voice low and steady. "What do you want to happen to the Lambert family after everything they've done?"


Arabella held the photo pieces close, tears running down her face.


Seeing her like this stirred something in Asher,a feeling he didn't quite understand.


He stretched out his hand. "Give it here. You'll have more pictures someday."


With her eyes still glistening, Arabella looked at the photo fragments. A few seconds later, she let them fall into Asher's palm.


At the hospital, a doctor took care of Arabella's arm and wrapped the wound in clean bandages.


A few instructions were given to Asher."You must be her boyfriend. That cut is deep.Make sure she keeps it dry for now, or it could get infected."



His lips pressed together, Asher gave a quiet nod.


He stayed by Arabella's side as they walked to Daisy's room.
Dominick followed close behind, nervous and unsure what to do.


He wondered why Asher didn't try to comfort Arabella. Maybe he just wasn't good at saying the right words.


Suddenly, Asher stopped walking and turned to give Dominick some instructions.


Dominick listened closely, eyes going wide with shock. He wanted to speak up, but when he caught Asher's cold, determined look, he quickly turned and walked away.


Quietly, Arabella sat by Daisy's hospital bed and watched over her. The longer she stayed there,the lighter her mood became.


Time slipped by as Arabella kept her vigil. Out of nowhere, someone handed her a letter.


Curiosity flickered across her face as she accepted the envelope and glanced at Asher. He remarked flatly, "Go ahead and open it."


Arabella slid the photograph out of the envelope.



In the picture, two young men stood side by side.Right away, Arabella recognized her father on the left. The other man looked so much like Asher that she realized he had to be his father.Both
wore military uniforms.


Age had yellowed the edges of the old photo, but it was still in beautiful shape.



Arabella traced her father's image, eyes full of longing and bittersweet memories.


Asher spoke up. "That's for you."


A flash of surprise crossed Arabella's face as the meaning behind his gesture dawned on her.


Did Asher give this to her because he knew how sad she was about the photo of Daisy and herself being lost? Was this his quiet way of offering comfort?


But one look at the well-preserved photo told her it meant a lot to him.


Soft light filled the room as Arabella looked at Asher. A gentle warmth spread through her heart."Thank you. I really appreciate it, but this must matter a lot to you too. I shouldn't take it."



A frown appeared on Asher's face.


Arabella added, "My sister will recover, and we'll have new pictures together. But this one is unique -there won't ever be another like it."


Carefully, Arabella returned the photo, her voice
full of gratitude. "Thank you, truly."


Without arguing, Asher tucked the photo away.He switched topics. "What's your plan for the Lambert family?"


A steely look came into Arabella's eyes. "They're going to pay for letting Joyce run wild. I've already made my move against Mrs. Lambert."



A change of topic followed as Asher asked, "Have you thought about moving somewhere safer? I've arranged a place for you."



He sent her the property address and continued,"Your sister will be able to rest much easier there."


Arabella glanced at the address and realized it was the most exclusive neighborhood in Griridge.



A few quiet moments passed as she weighed her options.


Maybe a new setting would be good for Daisy.Besides,with the Lambert family clearly coming after her now, staying at the hospital no longer felt safe.


She gave a grateful nod. "Thank you. What about you?"



Asher answered her simply. "This place is for you
and your sister. I'll only show up if it's really needed."


A small smile appeared on Arabella's face. "|understand. Thank you for everything."


Over time, Arabella found that Asher's character was better than she first thought. Building a friendship with the Gordon family seemed like it could give her and Daisy a brighter future.


Soon,they moved Daisy into the villa.



Everything about the new home exceeded Arabella's hope. One of the bedrooms had even been turned into a full hospital suite, and the presence of household staff made it clear just how much effort Asher put into making sure they were comfortable.


A middle-aged man dressed smartly stepped forward and nodded politely. "Miss Stanley, I'm your butler. Please let me know if you need anything at all."


"All right." With just one look, Arabella could sense that this butler was not just any servant but also someone trained to handle himself in a fight.



Asher spoke in his usual cooI tone. "If you ever need extra security, the butler can arrange it."
Arabella paused for a beat, thinking things over."Thank you. It's late, and I doubt you've had dinner yet. Would you like to stay and eat with me before heading out?"


She didn't want to seem ungrateful, not after all Asher had done for her.


A brief nod came from Asher. "All right."


The butler interjected, "I'll ask the chef to start cooking."


Arabella responded, "No, I'll take care of it myself."


A crease formed on Asher's brow. "But your arm is still injured."


Authority seemed to come naturally to him, even in small moments like this.
###Chapter 26 No One Will Ever Hurt You Again
Arabella smiled and said, "This is just a lttle scratch, and honestly, I'd like to cook for you tonight."


A small crease formed on Asher's brow. He paused before responding,"All right."


Her gaze shifted to Dominick. "Mr. Powell, why don't you join us for dinner too?"


Surprise lit up Dominick's face. He glanced at Asher, and only after receiving a silent nod did he reply. "Sure, I'd be happy to."


Without delay, Arabella walked into the kitchen.


Dominick took a seat near Asher and watched him open a laptop. The screen displayed files about the Lambert Group, and the sight sent a chill down Dominick's spine. It hadn't been long since Trace, and now the Lambert family were next on the list?


He tried to break the tension with a question."Mr.Gordon, do you have feelings for Miss Stanley?"


No warmth touched Asher's expression as he
responded coldly, "It's my father's wish."


Dominick had a hard time buying that answer.



He remembered when Asher showed nothing but impatience, yet lately, Arabella seemed to occupy his thoughts. Was it really only about family obligations?


In twenty minutes, Arabella had dinner ready, and Dominick jumped up to help carry the food. The sight of the colorful, fragrant dishes caught him off guard. "I didn't know you could cook like this,Miss Stanley."


Arabella gave a simple nod."Go ahead and eat."


Dominick wasted no time digging in, and the explosion of flavor left him speechless.Across the table, Asher and Arabella ate without showing any reaction, which made Dominick wonder if something was wrong with his own senses.


He tried another bite.



With the next mouthful, he almost lost control and spit it out. Meanwhile, Asher ate steadily,showing no sign anything was amiss. Not wanting to make a scene, he forced himself to swallow.


Arabella's eyes narrowed as she noticed his hesitation. "Is there a problem?"
Dominick stammered, "N-no, not at all."


Confusion lingered as Dominick tried to figure out what was going on.


Once dinner ended, Asher and Dominick got ready to leave. Asher turned to Arabella. "If anything happens, just give me a call."


Arabella nodded and answered in a cool, slightly stiff tone, "All right. Drive safe."


Back in the car, Dominick asked, "Mr. Gordon,what did you think of Miss Stanley's cooking?"


With barely a glance, Asher went back to his laptop. "It wasn't good."


Dominick stared at him. "Are you sure you have working taste buds?"


He couldn't understand how they managed to eat so calmly when the food tasted so bad.


Asher answered gently, "Even a young woman can eat it without complaining. Maybe you've never been hungry enough."


No reply came from Dominick, who could only sit there in silence.


He watched Asher, noticing that while his face was still cold, the indifferent aura around him had
faded a bit.


The realization dawned on Dominick that Asher might actually dislike him. Was he no longer in Asher's good graces?


A new determination formed in Dominick's mind.From now on, he would need to get along well with Arabella.


Inside the villa, Arabella went to check on Daisy.


Without warning, a voice called out, "Bella."



Wide-eyed, Arabella rushed to her sister's bedside and watched as Daisy's lips moved and she spoke again. "Bella."


"I'm right here," Arabella said, grabbing Daisy's hand with excitement. Tears streamed down Daisy's cheeks as she begged, "Please don't hurt me. I'm sorry. I promise I won't sneak food again."


Daisy's frail body curled in on itself.


Right away, Arabella's eyes filled with tears.She wrapped Daisy in a tight hug. "I'm here. No one will ever hurt you again."


A small voice escaped Daisy. "I missed you so much,Bella."


Tears continued to fall until, little by little, Daisy's
sobs began to fade.


Redness lingered in Arabella's eyes, and a deep ache settled in her chest. Just then, her phone started to ring. The call was from Joshua.


Stepping out of the room, Arabella picked up.Joshua spoke right away. "We've found a buyer,but he's not an easy one. He wants to know when he can move in."


A quick glance at the clock made up her mind."Tell him Sunday."


Joshua agreed."That works for us."


Without hesitation, Arabella took Meagan off her blacklist.



She sent off a blunt warning in her message."Get out of my home before Sunday arrives!"


Meagan's call came in right away.


The second Arabella answered, Meagan unleashed a stream of curses. "You little bitch!After what you did to Khloe, you never even visited her-heartless!"


A cold laugh left Arabella's lips. "Don't get too worked up. This is only the beginning. If you're already upset, you'll never handle what's coming next. Everything you did to Daisy, I'll make sure
you pay for it."


Chills ran through Meagan as she listened,though she tried to mask them with a sneer. She said, "Daisy brought it on herself. If I hadn't watched out for her, she might not even be alive today!"


Then, Meagan's voice grew gentle, taking on a falsely warm tone. "Since you're my brother's child, I'm willing to ignore your reckless behavior.I have looked after both of you for so long, which makes this house rightfully mine. If you wish to return here, apologize first, and I might consider giving you another chance!"
###Chapter 27 How Dare You Pull This On Me
Nothing in Arabella's life had prepared her for someone as shameless as Meagan.


She kept her voice even. "The villa has already been sold. If you're still there after Sunday, don't blame me for what happens."


Without waiting for a reply, Arabella ended the call.



Meagan glared at her phone, fuming over the call that had just ended. She tried calling back, but there was no answer. Rage spiled out as she muttered to herself, "That bitch! If she ever comes back, I'll show her what real discipline is."


On the couch, Khloe lounged in front of the TV,admiring herself in her phone screen's reflection.The scars on her face had faded a lot, just as she had been promised.


Curiosity got the better of Khloe. "Who was that,Mom? Was it Arabella?"



Meagan gave a cold smile. "Of course it was. That little bitch actually told us to get out. She claims
she sold the villa. I'd like to see who's bold enough to buy it. Whoever they are, I'll make sure the deal falls apart."


Khloe hardly looked worried. "We're not leaving.Let's see if anyone actually dares to buy the house!"


Plans were already in motion. If someone did show up, they intended to spread rumors about the place being haunted.


A smirk curled Khloe's lips. "Arabella is just too naive."



Her expression turned brighter as she remembered something. "By the way, tomorrow is Elissa's big rehearsal. A lot of important people will be there. Can I go?"


At the mention of Elissa, a smile broke through Meagan's irritation. "We can't just waltz in, but after it's over, we can pay her a visit."


The thought made Khloe beam. "That's great! I'm going to start live streaming again, Mom."


With her face healed, she finally felt ready to return to streaming.


"Go on then," Meagan answered, applying a fresh face mask.
She didn't take Arabella's words seriously.


The following day arrived, bringing rehearsal day at Griridge Theatre.



Arabella and Karlie sat among the audience when a familiar voice called out, "Daisy?"


Her gaze lifted to see Kenzie and several others walking over. A few dance students had been invited to watch, and by coincidence, Kenzie ended up right beside Arabella.


The sightof Arabella left Kenzie speechless.


Shock hit her when she realized Arabella was unscathed. Weren't Maryam's people supposed to have taken her away?


Kenzie couldn't hold back. "How did you manage to get out?" Her face twisted with mixed emotions.



"Why do you even care?" Arabella asked sharply,her voice laced with scorn.


The answer left Kenzie irritated and even more annoyed. She scanned Arabella up and down,letting out a mocking laugh. "Have you been planning payback while you were away? Like l said before, you can try all you want, but you'll never take on Joyce and her friends. Poor girls
like you stay poor!"


A smug smile crossed her lips. "If you beg me right now, maybe I'll speak up for you and get Joyce to go easy on you."


With Joyce's influence behind her, Kenzie had no problem throwing her weight around.


Arabella gave a half smile. "Sure."


Kenzie said, "Then get down and apologize."


Kenzie's phone appeared in her hand. Arabella could tell this wasn't the first time Daisy had been pushed into this.


Inside, Kenzie sneered. So Daisy still hadn't changed, and she was just as timid as before.


Due to her humble beginnings, she was stuck tagging along behind Elissa's circle. The only way she could feed her fragile ego was by belittling Daisy whenever she got the chance.


A sudden crash echoed through the room.


Something had smacked into Kenzie's knee,making her collapse to the floor.


A flicker of humor danced in Arabella's eyes as she looked down. "You're pretty skilled at begging. Must be second nature by now. Or
maybe it's just because Elissa and Joyce have never let you stand up for yourself, right?"


Kenzie's face drained of color. "You witch! How dare you pull this on me?"


Karlie chimed in, "The performance is about to start."



Sure enough, the stage lights dimmed, and Kenzie had no choice but to hold back her anger,silently vowing to get even with Arabella later.


Frustration simmered inside her.



In Kenzie's mind, Daisy's stubbornness was the reason she kept landing in trouble.


Only a minute passed before the dance performance got underway.


The dancers moved with such grace that the entire audience sat entranced.


Occasionally, someone whispered, "Isn't this one of Isabella's pieces? It's really stunning."


"Absolutely, Isabella is truly remarkable, and she stands among the finest dancers in the country."


"Elissa's solo is amazing too!" someone added.


"You know, she choreographed it herself. That takes real skill," another person replied.
Elissa's solo performance quickly drew its own share of attention.


As the last note faded, the audience broke into applause and words of praise filled the air.


"That was incredible!"


"Elissa's solo was especially impressive!"


"The younger dancers are surpassing the veterans these days."


Cheers and compliments followed Elissa as she took her bow and exited the stage, her face glowing with pride.


Kenzie's eyes darkened as she turned and gave Arabella a smug look. "Did you see that, Daisy?That's the difference between you and Elissa.You'll always be stuck here in the audience."


A cold look settled on Arabella's face. "And what about you? No matter how talented Elissa is,you're still just plain old Kenzie. It's almost laughable, the way you hide behind someone else's achievements just to feel important."
###Chapter 28 You Owe Everyone An Explanation!
Kenzie felt that jab cut straight through her pride,and her cheeks flushed with anger. She clenched her jaw and snapped, "At least I didn't end up being walked all over!"


Right after that, the crowd erupted into a sea of hushed voices and muttered rumors.


"Hey,come see this for yourselves!"


"This is beyond gross. Elissa owes us all an explanation!"


"Isn't there a video of Elissa's dance floating around Griridge University's forum? Did she seriously rip someone off?"


Not even a moment had passed after Elissa's group left the stage before people started talking,their stares cold and accusing. Elissa could feel their eyes following her every move, and confusion clouded her face.


In a rush, Zoe appeared, shoved her phone in front of Elissa, and asked, "What is this about?Why does your routine look exactly like the one
Kenzie uploaded to the forum?"


When Elissa caught a glimpse of the video, the blood drained from her face.


She had used Kenzie's moves as her own. But admitting it was out of the question.


"There must be some mistake. I created this choreography myself," Elissa responded. She turned to Kenzie and said, "That was my work,right?"


Kenzie never expected her post on the school forum to cause this much trouble. She wondered how everything had escalated so quickly.


With dozens of eyes locked on her, Kenzie had no choice but to play along. "Yes, Elissa did all the choreography.I was just fooling around onstage."



A quiet sigh slipped out from Elissa, but a sharp,frosty look flickered in her eyes.


Kenzie had posted that video behind her back,clearly hoping to get her in trouble.


Clearly,Kenzie would have to pay for this.


"Then how do you explain these comments?"someone called out from the crowd.


Insults from Kenzie sat right under the video,
glaring for everyone to see.


"You stole my work, Elissa! I put my heart into that dance, and you just took it like it was nothing!"


"Everyone's going to find out who you really are.You can't fake it forever."


With a quick flick of herthumb,Zoe read through the comments, her face growing more and more grim as she looked over at Elissa, completely stunned.


Over the years, Zoe had always respected Elissa,especially since she was close to Zoe's niece.


Any hint of plagiarism could destroy Elissa's standing in the troupe, and she would be gone in a heartbeat.


Pressure mounted i Elissa's chest, sending a cold shiver down her arms, but fury simmered just beneath the surface.


Before long, tears slid down Elissa's cheeks."Kenzie and I have always been friends. I never imagined she'd say these things about me behind my back."


Turning her attention back to Kenzie, she said,sounding hurt, "If there was a problem, Kenzie,you could have talked to me instead of trying to
ruin my reputation in front of everyone."


Without missing a beat, Zoe blurted out, "Kenzie,you owe everyone an explanation!"


Kenzie could feel every stare drilling into her,making her want to disappear. The way Zoe looked at her said everything. The crowd's faces,twisted in judgment, didn't help.


Elissa's glare was sharper than ever.


Any confession would end her place in this industry. Staying silent, though, would make her Elissa's next target.


Meanwhile, Arabella lounged back in her chair,eager to see how Kenzie would handle this disaster.


Words failed her as Kenzie stammered, "I-l..."


No sooner had she started, Zoe interjected,"Elissa's never been that kind of girl. You've really crossed the line this time, Kenzie. Picking on her like that is just cruel."


Kenzie trembled. The urge to defend herself was strong, yet every pair of eyes in the room made it clear nobody would take her side. Eventually, she whispered, "I'm sorry. I was just jealous of Elissa.That's all."
Her chin dropped as she stared at the floor,weighed down by a sense of deep unfairness.


Shock rippled through the crowd in a wave of startled murmurs.


川 can＇t believe people in college would go this far," someone blurted out.


"No way Elissa had to steal from anyone. She's a natural," another voice insisted.


"Kenzie is just pathetic, always sticking to Elissa like a shadow, and now she's trying to ruin her," a third added.


Fingers curling into fists, Kenzie pressed her nails deep into her skin, trying not to cry.


From the other side, Elissa spoke in a gentle,almost sorrowful tone. "I never thought Kenzie would do something like this. Still, I need to take some responsibility. I should've noticed she wasn't herself lately. If I had paid more attention as her friend, maybe things wouldn't have turned out this way."


The room immediately softened, and sympathy shifted in Elissa's direction.



Arabella rolled her eyes. Elissa was always clever at turning the tide.
A faint smile played on Zoe's lips. All along, she trusted Elissa's character and believed there was no way she would resort to copying.


A sudden shout sliced through the crowd. "That dance didn't belong to your friend at all-it's Isabella's! Anyone can see Elissa's routine matches a video Isabella uploaded a while back.She deleted it soon after, maybe because she thought it wasn't good enough. Lucky for me,l downloaded it-I'm lsabella's biggest fan, after all!"
###Chapter 29 You Are Expelled
From her seat, Arabella watched as the speaker,who was also a dance major, walked straight over to Jessica Roman, the troupe's instructor,handing her a phone with the video.


A look of thunder crossed Jessica's face once she finished watching.


"Elissa, can you explain what's going on here?"Jessica asked sharply as she pressed play and showed the video right in front of Elissa.


All around her, teammates craned their necks to get a glimpse, each one taken aback by what they saw.



"I never realized Isabella had choreographed something like that before!"


"To be honest, it felt recognizable right away. I just never imagined it would turn out to be one of Isabella's pieces."


"Has Elissa completely lost it? Plagiarizing Isabella's dance is asking for trouble."


Taking credit for a peer's routine was already a scandal. To steal from Isabella, who had such a
loyal fanbase, only made it worse.


Word traveled quickly. Audience members shared the clip, and the atmosphere turned from confusion to outrage.


"She doesn't belong in the Griridge Troupe with this kind of behavior!"


"How could the troupe let this happen? Elissa should be kicked out, plain and simpole!"


"Elissa needs to go,right now!"


Elissa felt the world spinning as she stumbled backward, her face completely drained of color.Zoe turned to her, stunned. "Elissa, is any of this true?"


Unprepared and overwhelmed, Elissa stammered,"|...


A wave of realization hit her. Kenzie hadactually taken Isabella's choreography.


If that fact had been clear from the start,admitting to using Kenzie's routine would have been the least of her worries.


However, the chance to change things had already slipped away, and now everyone was convinced that she had copied Isabella's work.
"Unbelievable!" Zoe's hand struck without warning, the sharp sound echoing as it landed across Elissa's cheek.


That single blow shattered any dignity Elissa had left. One hand pressed to her stinging face, she tried to speak. "Ms. Miller, I-"



"You have no idea what you've done!" Zoe's fury was barely contained. This scandal would follow her too.


Tears finally overtook Elissa. "I never wanted things to turn out like this. I only wanted to use her dance for inspiration-"


"Do you even know where the line is?" Zoe's voice rose above the murmurs. "Inspiration isn't the same as stealing!"



Stepping forward, Jessica faced the audience."We sincerely apologize for what happened here.Should it be proven that Elissa copied Isabella's choreography, she will be expelled from our troupe. Thank you all for demanding honesty."


A sharp gesture signaled the team to head backstage.



Cold eyes bore into Elissa as Jessica paused. "Is there anything else you want to say for yourself?"
"I made a mistake. I just wanted to study it." Elissa sobbed as tears rolled down her cheeks and reached her trembling lips.


"You are expelled," Jessica announced in a voice as cold as ice.



Without sparing Elissa another glance, she walked away in search of the vice president for the troupe.


A replacement had to be found before the official performance could go on.


Elissa's legs buckled beneath her, sending her crashing to the floor, the harsh reality settling in that her dream of a dance career had come to an end.



Time slipped away unnoticed while Elissa sat in stunned silence. As the room slowly emptied,clarity returned, and her only hope now was to plead with Jessica for another chance.


Inside the rehearsal space, a familiarsilhouette beside Jessica caught her eye.


Shock made Elissa's voice crack. "Daisy? Is that really you?"


Arabella answered with a calm smile, "Hi, Elissa.I'll be stepping in as your replacement."
A rush of disbelief sent Elissa into a panic. "You're joking! You think you've earned this spot?" In her eyes, Daisy was nothing but a background extra,and she could not believe someone like her could ever measure up. "Ms. Roman, she's not qualified. She just isn't good enough!"


Jessica's patience snapped. "Leave the studio,Elissa.I won't allow you to disturb our work."



Desperation made Elissa raise her voice. "You can't let her do this! She really can't do it!"


Watching Daisy take her place filled Elissa with unbearable humiliation.


Jessica's command was sharp. "Out, now!"



Biting down hard on her lower lip, Elissa glared with pure resentment. Even so, she forced herself to walk out, dignity in shreds.


Taking a measured breath, Arabella turned to the rest of the troupe and offered a polite introduction, her gaze settling on Lailah. "Hi everyone, I'm Daisy Stanley. From today on, I'll be joining your practices. I might've been a substitute before, but I promise to give it my all and keep pace with everyone here."


Lailah's eyes narrowed in clear displeasure.
Throughout.thenexthour,thetmosphere  a softened as teammates saw that Arabella's skills easily matched what Elissa had brought to the group.


By the time class ended, a crowd gathered around Arabella, eager to hear the story behind her previous defeat to Elissa.


Scrolling through group chat messages, Arabella saw how Elissa's plagiarism scandal had gone viral. Whatever reputation Elissa once had was now in ruins.


Online,the drama was only escalating.
###Chapter 30 That Woman Is Absolutely Insufferable!
Few names carriedas much weight in the dance world as Isabella's, making Elissa's choice of victim the worst mistake she could have made.



"That routine Elissa put on? Nothing more than average. Trying to use Isabella's fame to boost herself is just laughable."


"The Griridge Troupe needs to be far more selective about its members!"



"In school, Elissa is a decent dancer. But let's be honest, she has a real problem with jealousy.Anyone who outshines her becomes a target."


"Why hasn't Griridge University expelled her already? Do they care about their reputation?"






A new notification appeared as Kaitlyn sent a
message. "Kenzie got beat up."


A series of photos followed, revealing Kenzie's bruised face and a noticeable limp.


None of this shocked Arabella. She responded,"Thanks. But what's your reason for sending me this?"


Kaitlyn replied almost immediately, "I figured you'd want to know what happened."


Narrowing her eyes, Arabella tried to piece together Kaitlyn's motives. Whatever connected Kaitlyn and Daisy was still a mystery,but Arabella didn't sense any malice from her.



Leaving the theater, Arabella barely took two steps before someone's hand clamped around her arm. "I knew you had something to do with this,Arabella!"


Eyes wide with disbelief, Meagan confronted her,suspicion written all over her face.



Next to her, Elissa's eyes were puffy and red
from hours of tears, her carefully built reputation having crumbled in an instant. The moment she caught Arabella's name and laid eyes on her, bitterness twisted across Elissa's face. "So, you're Arabella."


Out of nowhere, a sense of dread crept in and made her stomach clench.


Arabella and Daisy could not have been more different when they were little girls.


Everyone remembered Daisy's bright, bubbly spirit, a complete contrast to Arabella's cold,almost unapproachable presence. That chilling aura always left others uneasy. Only after Arabella left did their bullying of Daisy begin.


Arabella's disappearance came right after grade school,and she claimed to work. They assumed that she might have started a family far away.


Who could have guessed she would turn up again like this?


Reminded of Arabella's rough past, Elissa felt
her contempt deepen. "You've got guts,Arabella. Dropping out after elementary school and faking your way into Griridge University?That's against the law!"


One step closer, Arabella fixed Elissa with an indifferent glare. "The way you and your family treated Daisy is enough to put you away for life.You got away once, but I'm here to make sure you finally pay for it."


A thunderclap split the sky, and the clouds unleashed a sudden downpour, rain hammering the pavement.


Goosebumps pricked Meagan's and her daughters' arms as the temperature dropped,and Elissa instinctively edged away. "Y-you..."


Jaw clenched, Meagan interjected, "Stop making things up, Arabella. Daisy had this coming, and you know it! Go straight to the troupe and confess. Tell everyone you set up Elissa and that she didn't plagiarize!"
Khloe's anger flared as well. "That's right! How dare you accuse Elissa of such things? You're nothing but trouble!"


She lifted her hand to strike, fury written all over her face.



But Arabella was nothing like Daisy. The cold,defiant look in her eyes made Khloe falter.Images of Arabella's legendary temper flashed through Khloe's mind, and fear sent her scurrying behind Meagan for safety.


With a deep breath, Elissa, older and more composed, switched tactics. Her voice turned gentle, almost pleading. "Arabella, let's not fight about this. We're family, aren't we? Let's go home and work things out together."


A gentle smile crossed her face as she added,"You only made it through elementary school,and you don't have any kind of certification. Life out there must be pretty rough for someone like you."
Arabella responded, her words cold and sharp."If people like you are surviving just fine, then why would you think I'd have a hard time? And I already warned you. Get out of my house,now.I don't want to see you there any longer."


Without wasting another second, Arabella flagged down a cab and climbed in.


Frustration boiled over, and Khloe snapped,"That woman is absolutely insufferable!"


A heavy frown appeared on Elissa's face. The thought that Arabella posed as Daisy was something she never would have believed.


The rain came down in sheets, forcing them to rush back to their house.



Back at home, irritation lingered in Elissa's voice. "You could have told me sooner that Arabella was back."


Khloe let out a grumble. "Mom said it was better not to bother you since you're busy with the dance group. Tell me the truth. Did you copy
someone else's work because of Arabella?"


Elissa clenched her fists as she thought about Kenzie, bitterness rising inside her. "It's got nothing to do with Arabella."



A sigh escaped Khloe. "Well, that's that.Arabella clearly isn't all that impressive. Who does she think she is, talking to us like that?The days when her parents mattered are over.Our family holds the most power in Griridge now."


Suddenly, an idea flashed in Khloe's mind. She gave Elissa's arm a quick tug. "Go tell your . .. ...    
###Chapter 31 Just Don't Go Too Far
A skeptical look crossed Elissa's face. "Can you actually prove it? Arabella and Daisy are twins,after all-same faces, matching DNA!"
Grudging acceptance colored Khloe's reply."Never mind."


"I'm going to make a call." Without another word,Elissa rose from her seat and headed out to the balcony, pulling out her phone to call Joyce.


"Elissa." Joyce's greeting came heavy with exhaustion,her voice lacking its usual spark.



Concern flickered in Elissa's eyes. "What's happened?"


Tears shimmered in Joyce's gaze. "It's my mom.She's not well."



Alarm replaced concern as Elissa pressed for
answers. "How did that happen?"


A memory flashed through Joyce's mind-the men in black bursting through the door, their identities still a mystery, though they almost certainly had it out for the Lambert family.


She couldn't bring herself to tell Elissa the truth,so she kept it vague. "Just an accident. Nothing you need to worry about."


Shifting gears,Elissa lowered her voice. "I need you to know something important." She explained how Arabella had shown up at school,passing herself off as Daisy and seeking revenge. "She's at our school because of Daisy."


Realization lit up Joyce's expression. "So that explains the change in her. She's acting like someone else entirely."


Anger sharpened her tone. "Both those women -leeching off your family and still daring to cause trouble? I promise, Elissa, I won't let her
set foot in school again."


Hatred burned fiercely within Joyce, her anger toward Arabella reaching its height.



Elissa spoke in a gentle tone. "Alright, Joyce.Just don't go too far."


With a theatrical sigh, Joyce replied, "Honestly,you're too soft. What would you ever do without someone like me?"


A quiet smile lingered on Elissa's lips after the call ended.



Handling situations would have been far more complicated without someone as reckless as Joyce around.


Meanwhile, rain kept tapping steadily against the windowpanes.


Returning to the villa, Arabella headed straight for a steaming shower, letting the warmth chase away the lingering chill.


Before long, a gentle knock sounded at her
door.


Answering, Arabella found the butler waiting with a glass in hand. "Miss Stanley, I saw how soaked you were. Please have some warm milk so you don't catch a cold."


A grateful nod accompanied her response."Thank you. Tell me, how many bodyguards do you have available?"


Reassurance came swiftly from the butler."However many you require, Miss Stanley. And if that isn't enough, Mr. Gordon can authorize the elite security unit."


Those so-called elite guards-death warriors-demanded enormous investment to prepare for duty.


Bodyguards weren't needed for the moment, so Arabella left instructions for the butler to keep watch over the villa while she went to Daisy's room.


A steady presence at her side, the butler
accompanied her on the walk. "The doctor made his rounds today. Your sister's condition keeps improving. There's little cause for concern. Security here is top-notch. It's impossible for outsiders to cross."


Glancing around, Arabella nodded thoughtfully."The setting is truly first-rate. But tell me-where does Asher stay?"


A quiet explanation followed. "This was once Mr. Gordon's residence," the butler replied."Most likely, he's staying at his office these days."


This information caught Arabella off guard.



Yet, as she looked over the tasteful furnishings and subtle elegance, she had to admit the space reflected Asher's personal style.



A knowing smile spread across the butler's face. "He thinks the world of you, Miss Stanley."


The words left Arabella quiet, unable to argue.
Following her time with Daisy, Arabella retreated to her room and dialed Asher's number.


A rich, compelling voice answered on the other end."Hello?"



The deep timbre was unmistakable-Asher himself.


With a boldness she didn't entirely intend,Arabella asked, "Are you coming back to stay with me tonight?"


A heavy pause filled the space between them,thick with unspoken words.



Catching herself, Arabella realized how her question might have sounded and opened her mouth to clarify, but Asher spoke first, his voice quiet and steady. "You know I'm only doing this because my father wanted me to watch over you."


After a slow, steadying breath, Arabella explained, "What I meant is, you could use this place too. Once Daisy's better, we'll move out.
Sleeping at your office can't be good for you."


Brushing off her offer, Asher kept his tone distant. "That's not necessary. Make yourself comfortable there. I'll drop by if I need to."



"Alright," Arabella answered, then ended the call.


There was a nagging suspicion in Arabella's mind that Asher had chosen his words on purpose.


Annoyance simmered within her; he had a knack for getting under her skin lately.



Still, a small voice inside wondered if she was reading too much into every interaction.



At that very moment, far across town, Asher lounged in his spacious office, his posture one of lazy confidence.


Facing him, Dominick caught a fleeting hint of a smile breaking through Asher's typically stoic features,and for a second, questioned whether
his imagination was running wild.


Dominick asked, "Was that Miss Stanley on the line,Mr.Gordon?"



Without much interest, Asher gave a simple nod in response."Mm-hmm."



No words followed from Dominick's end; he kept his thoughts to himself.


Everything about Asher lately hinted at a shift-he wasn't quite the same as before.


Dominick's curiosity bubbled to the surface."Does this mean we need to keep closer tabs on her?"


With a look of practiced detachment, Asher replied, "Like I said-just watch for anything significant."


Dominick knew he didn't mean what he said,but he still played along. "Understood. I was about to show you something regarding her at school, but it wasn't urgent. Don't worry. I'
handle it from now on."


A flash of intensity appeared in Asher's eyes.

"Let me see it."
###Chapter 32 Remember Your Place
Dominick tried to downplay the matter. "It's probably nothing serious, Mr. Gordon. Just a few rumors spreading online."


A steely edge crept into Asher's voice, calm yet unmistakably firm."Show me."


Without delay, Dominick passed the iPad into his hands.


A few quick swipes brought up the university's online forum for Asher to scan.


"Can you believe how Daisy acted? She owes everything to Elissa's family and still took her place."


Another chimed in, "Didn't Elissa get kicked out for plagiarism?"


Someone quickly interjected, "That wasn't true!Kenzie confessed they choreographed that
dance together. Elissa never meant to copy Isabella's routine."


Sympathy filled the comments. "Elissa can't catch a break. First Kenzie, now Daisy. If I were Daisy, I'd have turned down the offer to join the troupe."


Judgment was harsh and direct. "Anyone with a heart would refuse that role."



Support for Elissa poured in. "She's shameless for taking that spot. Poor Elissa deserves better."


Toxic rumors weren't limited to the forum; soon,the entire Internet was awash with harsh criticism, labeling Daisy as unfeeling and cold.


While Asher's expression stayed stone-cold,Dominick could sense the anger simmering beneath the surface.


Leaning in, Dominick asked in a low voice,"Should we intervene?"
Asher's response came crisp and decisive."This is our campus. If we don't handle it, who will?"


Dominick responded quickly, "Understood. I'll check with Miss Stanley for her instructions."


Well before Dominick's call reached her,Arabella had already scrolled through the flood of gossip online. Calmly, she instructed him to hold off-no action needed for now.


When the morning came, she showed up on campus just as she always did.


Navigating the hallways, Arabella found herself treated like an outcast-classmates sidestepped her, sent sharp glances her way,and whispered behind their hands.


Isolation followed her everywhere; not a soul offered so much as a greeting. Still, she moved through the crowds, her chin held high.


Meanwhile, Elissa enjoyed a ring of admirers,her friends huddled close around her
With Arabella gone, Kenzie had been relegated to errand duty, running from one classmate to another,arms loaded with their requests.


Even so, Kenzie's eyes met Arabella's with a trace of sympathy.



Halfway through class, a note sailed across the aisle from Kenzie's desk.


A quick flick of her fingers opened the folded paper. "Daisy, you've become truly pathetic. No one likes you. No one notices you. You could disappear and not a single person would care."


Pen in hand, Arabella scribbled a reply. "It must be easy being someone else's servant all day.Enjoy it."


She tossed the note right back.



Kenzie read the words, then balled up the paper in her fist, frustration plain on her face.


With a shaky breath, Kenzie scribbled another note and flicked it across the aisle. Arabella
barely spared it a glance before tossing it straight into the trash, driving Kenzie's frustration even higher.


Just as the bell neared, a stack of notebooks landed with a thud on Kenzie's desk. Joyce,popping her gum with a smirk, said, "Finish my assignments, will you?"


A strained smile appeared on Kenzie's face."Sure, Joyce. There's quite a pile today, though.Mind if I start with half?"


That answer set Joyce off. She grabbed a fistful of Kenzie's hair and hissed, "You got some nerve. Stay up all night if you have to, but l expect it all done."


Kenzie froze, shock flickering across her face.



The spectacle only amused Joyce further."What's this? Planning to be a rebel like Daisy?You even know your own worth?"


Desperation laced Kenzie's words as she rushed to explain, "No way, Joyce. I'd never.
We're friends-she means nothing to me."


Joyce's laughter exploded, sharp and cruel."Friends? Is that what you think? Because Elissa let you stand near her, you believe you belong with us? Open your eyes. You're just here to serve. Remember your place."


Mockery rang out all around, other students joining in the laughter.


Kenzie stared at the sneers and contempt on every face, her whole body tensing,humiliation washing over her.


Unable to bear it, she bowed her head, tears spilling silently down her cheeks.


Surviving until graduation seemed impossible with so much pressure closing in on every side.


A flash of memory brought Arabella's words back to Kenzie, and regret flooded her thoughts. Had she never chased Elissa's approval, maybe college could have been simple-maybe even peaceful.
Once the lesson ended, Arabella remained slouched over her desk, her appetite gone and her only plan to catch a bit of sleep.



All around her, the room hummed with chatter,every word tinged with ridicule and derision.
###Chapter 33 Let Go Of Her!
"Daisy really puts on a show-she acts all sweet, but there's something cold about her underneath."


"Honestly, even if Elissa did copy someone's work, I still think she's a good person at heart."


"Can't the school just expel Daisy already? It's exhausting sharing a classroom with her."


All around Elissa, classmates clustered close,offering reassurance and encouragement.


"Elissa, you should bring your case to the Dance Association. They'll get justice for you."



A steady resolve shone in Elissa's eyes as she nodded. "I will. Thank you all so much. Without your support, I'm not sure I would have made it this far."


"You have to stick it out, Elissa. We're behind
you all the way."


With a grateful smile, Elissa responded,"Thanks, everyone. You're amazing. Lunch is on me at the cafeteria-let's go."


Cheers erupted. "You're the greatest, Elissa! We love you!"



"I can't wait to tell my friends how lucky I am to have a classmate like you," another classmate exclaimed.


Excitement buzzed through the group.


As Joyce prepared to spit out her gum,Elissa offered her a tissue. "Joyce, use this-don't litter."


"Okay." Complying, Joyce spat the gum onto the tissue, which Elissa promptly took from her.Together, the whole group exited the classroom,laughter echoing behind them.


On their way past Arabella's desk, a commotion broke out-Elissa appeared to stumble, and
suddenly the gum slipped from her hand,landing right in Arabella's hair.


Feigning regret, Elissa fumbled for a tissue."Oops, sorry about that."


Every attempt to help only tangled more hair in the sticky mess, her touch anything but gentle,leaving Arabella's scalp smarting.


Sitting up straight, Arabella fixed Elissa with a steady look.



In a sweet voice, Elissa added, "Daisy, I'm really sorry. I swear it wasn't intentional."


A faint, satisfied smile tugged at the corners of her mouth.



She did that on purpose. If Arabella wanted retribution,she ought to understand what Daisy had endured first.



A sharp scream tore through the classroom,drawing every eye.


Instead of shrinking away, Arabella yanked the
gum free from her own hair and smashed it into Elissa's, ripping away a handful of strands with a swift motion. Tears sprang to Elissa's eyes as she cried out, "Stop! That hurts!"


Panic swept the room; students hurried over,trying to pull the two apart.


Cries of protest filled the air. "Daisy, let go of her!"


Accusations flew as someone scolded, "How could you be so cruel? You're in her family's debt. The least you could do is treat her with respect!"


A sharp tug freed the gum from Elissa's hair, but Arabella's forceful pull brought a clump of hair with it. Elissa's shriek echoed through the room as she dropped to her knees, clutching her head. Her fingers came away stained with blood, and dizziness swept over her.


Turning next to the classmate who had spoken out, Arabella pressed the sticky wad hard onto
his scalp.


"Ouch! It hurts!" the boy shouted in pain, tears springing to his eyes. Rage surged, and he lunged at Arabella-only to receive a stinging slap that split his lip.


Leveling a cold gaze at the room, Arabella spoke up. "You call yourselves defenders of justice? Siding with the bullies just makes you the same as them."



With that, she strode away, leaving chaos in her wake.



Shocked silence filled the room for several heartbeats before anyone rushed to help Elissa and the boy.


Elissa, voice trembling, said, "This is all because of me. I shouldn't have involved everyone."



Immediate comfort came from the others."Don't blame yourself, Elissa. Daisy was out of line."
Touching the blood on his scalp, the boy trembled with fury. "I'm going straight to the administration. Daisy needs to be expelled for this!"


Grief welled up as Elissa looked at the hair on the floor, but a cold satisfaction replaced it when she imagined Arabella's fate. "Go ahead,Arabella. That little outburst is about to cost you everything," she pondered, lips curving in a wintry smile.


Within two hours, hashtags like #DaisyBulliedElissa,#GriridgeUniversityBullyingCase, and #UngratefulDaisy were dominating the trending lists online.


Prestige and honor surrounded Griridge University, the crown jewel of local education,but now a scandal had shattered its calm-allegations of bullying had everyone talking.In the midst of the uproar, Arabella received a summons to the university president's office.
A gentle tone colored the president's words as he addressed her. "Miss Stanley, can you tell me what took place? Mr. Gordon has already brought your situation to my attention. I'd like you to be honest with me."


A steady confidence marked Arabella's reply."Please don't trouble yourself, sir. I'll have this situation sorted out by next week."



Though she looked barely older than a student,Arabella radiated a calm authority that made the president unconsciously nod in agreement.



With the meeting over, Arabella headed back to the villa.


Saturday arrived, bringing a day free from classes.


Freed from their studies, even more people tuned in, eager to see the latest twist in the controversy.


Daisy's name was now infamous.
Everywhere online, angry voices filled the comment sections.


Meanwhile, Elissa's Twitter exploded-her follower count shot up by five hundred thousand in a single day.


By Sunday morning, Elissa had returned home.


Sitting at the breakfast table, Khloe scrolled through Elissa's profile, unable to hide her envy."You're amazing, Elissa! Your followers just keep coming. You've already passed two million!"
###Chapter 34 This Place Belongs To Me Now!
Envy crept through Khloe as she stared at the numbers climbing on Elissa's screen.


Streaming had been her world since she left middle school, and despite years of effort, just a little over a million followers was the best she could claim-a respectable count, but nothing like Elissa's overnight rise.


Effortlessly, Elissa seemed to charm the Internet, winning attention without breaking a sweat.


Fingers absently tracing the spot where so much hair had been torn away, Elissa winced at the loss. But with every nasty word thrown at Arabella online, her lips curled in satisfaction."No need to fight her openly. The crueler she acts, the more everyone takes my side."
Meagan's voice held a note of encouragement."You've got a good head on your shoulders,Elissa. Who knows, maybe the Dance Association will let you back into the dance troupe after all."


Bennie, cheerful one moment, suddenly frowned. "You don't really think Arabella would go through with selling the house, do you?"


Dismissively, Meagan waved the concern away."It's not an issue. We're living here, so she can't do anything about it. After all the years I've spent caring for her and Daisy, this place ought to have belonged to me from the start."


Khloe chimed in, scorn in her voice, "Exactly.Arabella's dreaming if she thinks she can take it back. Both those sisters would have been better off gone with their parents!"


Childhood memories lingered-Khloe remembered envying her uncle's family, their wealth and refinement impossible to ignore.
Arabella and Daisy had once looked every bit the privileged girls, while she and her sister had been like country girls. Now, fortunes had flipped, and those sisters were at the bottom.


A smug look crossed Bennie's face. "It's funny how things turn out. Makes you wonder if Arabella's dad would regret everything, seeing how low she's fallen. If only he'd treated me right back then, maybe things would have been different."


A chuckle escaped Meagan. "He brought it on himself-selfish to the core. That's what cost him his life so soon."
Out of nowhere, the dining table exploded,splinters flying in every direction. Panic seized the room as everyone scrambled for cover,though several still ended up with cuts from the shards.


A chilling female voice echoed through the chaos. Arabella appeared in the doorway,framed by harsh light, her gaze cold and
unyielding.


"Back when I was young, none of you had a cent to your name. You couldn't even buy a scrap of meat. My father pulled strings and found you jobs, helping you scrape by until you could finally call yourselves average. But laziness never left you. You couldn't handle real work and tried to imitate my father's business,setting up your own company behind his back.All you managed was to squander everything,and once again, my parents had to clean up your pathetic disaster."


The mention of their failures sucked all color from their faces. Bennie's features twisted into a stormy glare.


Cold eyes swept over the group. Arabella saw only greed and bitterness beneath their designer clothes, no hint of conscience to be found.


She continued, voice like ice, "Those projects vou relied on? Mv narents handed them to vou.
Without their help, you would have starved.Everything you have is because of them. And this is how you repay us-taking our home and tormenting my sister!"


A brittle laugh burst from Bennie. "So what if that's all true? Now you've come back to throw us out? Let's see you try. Your parents aren't here to save you."


Defiance flashed in Khloe's posture as she folded her arms. "Go ahead and call your buyer,Arabella. I'll camp right here in the living room.lf anyone tries to move me, it'll be over my dead body!"


Gritting her teeth against the pain in her hand,Elissa shot Arabella a look filled with nothing but ridicule.


To Elissa, Arabella's hopefulness seemed almost laughable.


Years of living under this roof had convinced them the house was theirs by right.
No one, they believed, could possibly take it from them now.


Without warning, a gruff voice rang out. "What are you people doing in my home?"


A towering man stomped inside, a handful of tough-looking companions in tow.


A scowl twisted the man's face. "Get out! This place belongs to me now!"


Their arrival blotted out the sunlight, shadows stretching menacingly across the room.



Eyes grew wide with shock as Meagan and her family struggled to process the intrusion.



Trying to keep calm, Bennie raised his hands."Hold on, buddy. There's a mistake. This house actually belongs to us-"


"Fuck you!" the man yelled, rage flaring in his voice. With surprising agility for his size, he closed the distance, sending Bennie sprawling with a brutal kick. Out came the property deed,
which he waved in front of their faces. "Read it!My name's on the title. Still think you can steal my house? Get real. Boys, toss them out!"



Bennie barely managed to spit blood before he and his family landed hard on the front steps,tossed out without a shred of ceremony.
###Chapter 35 I'm All The Family You've Got Left
Shock held Bennie and his family frozen as suitcases, clothes, and even treasured heirlooms were hurled after them, piling up in a chaotic heap.


Bennie's heart sank as he watched his cherished antique vase hit the ground and shatter to pieces. He shouted in protest, "You can't do this-this is destruction of private property!"


The burly man only smirked. "Call the cops if you want! The deed says it's mine!"


Anger and humiliation washed over Bennie until his knees nearly gave out.


"Are you alright, Dad?" Elissa hurried to steady him, all the while shooting a venomous glare at Arabella's poised silhouette. "Arabella, how
could you? This house was your father's legacy -how could you sell it to someone like that?"


Never in her wildest dreams had Elissa imagined Arabella would actually sell the house, let alone to such a merciless new owner.



Arabella replied coldly, "So you admit it was my father's? Yet you parasites thought you could just squat here forever!"


Elissa's face burned with shame,leaving her utterly lost for words.


Their noisy eviction quickly became a neighborhood spectacle.



Curious voices drifted from nearby homes."What's all this ruckus?"


"Did the Tucker family really get kicked out?"



Meagan,always ready to play the victim, burst into dramatic sobs for any/one within earshot."Oh, what a tragedy! What will become of us?"


Back inside, Arabella shut out their noise,
paying not the slightest attention to their commotion.


Arabella searched every room upstairs, hoping to find traces of her parents. The house turned up empty-until she peered inside the doghouse.


Not a single one of Daisy's dresses or shoes remained inside, just a few forgotten scraps tucked into the straw of that little shelter.Arabella couldn't fathom how Daisy had managed to live under such conditions.


Tears threatened to fall, though a quiet gratitude filled her heart-Daisy, at least,had hidden away the last pieces of their parents'legacy.


Hands sifting through the bedding, Arabella's fingers brushed against something firm. She drew out a well-worn book.



Across its cover, the title read The Ancient Healer's Handbook.
A jolt of surprise ran through her. It was a well-worn medical text. How had Daisy ended up with this? Had she needed it to heal herself every time she got hurt?


Whatever the reason, Arabella gathered up every scrap that belonged to Daisy, slipping her card safely into her pocket as well.


With the small pile in hand, she stepped into the living room.



Destruction met her eyes-furniture splintered and broken by the burly man's crew.


The sight didn't bother her. Nearly every piece had been brought in by Meagan anyway.


Crossing the room, the new owner approached and offered the deed to Arabella.



Accepting it with a steady hand, she nodded."Thank you."


The man returned the gesture with respect. "Of course, Miss Stanley. I'll keep a few men on the
property. If the Tuckers try anything, we'll make sure they don't come near."


These muscle-bound enforcers weren't random -they were actors Arabella had hired to stage the spectacle, since her final decision was to keep the house after all.


With a measured voice, Arabella instructed,"Hold onto the deed for the time being. There could still be trouble ahead. I'm heading out now."


On her way past the threshold, Meagan's wails filled the air. At the sight of Arabella, Meagan's features twisted in a mask of hatred.


"Heartless, that's what you are!" Meagan spat her words like venom. "If it hadn't been for my father raising yours, you'd be nothing today!"


Arabella's gaze hardened, a chill in her tone. "Is that so? My father was his own son-wasn't it his job as a parent to care for him?"



Face flushed with rage, Meagan sputtered.
"That's ridiculous..." She wanted to unleash more, but the words faltered. "You know, I'm all the family you've got left. Your dad would never forgive you for treating me like this."


A cold smile played on Arabella's lips. "If he could see what you did to Daisy, he'd ask why l didn't throw you out sooner."


She didn't wait for a reply, striding away without looking back.


Wailing erupted from Khloe as her precious clothes landed in the dirt. "Mom, what do l do?My brand-new Versace-my handbags-everything's ruined!"


Rage made Meagan's head spin. "What's left to do? We'll have to find somewhere else to live.That's what!"


Rolling her eyes, Elissa scoffed, "It's not like we don't own other houses."


Steeling herself, Elissa found her composure again. "Right-let's keep our heads up. In the
end, Arabella will pay for this. Just wait."


Ever since Bennie joined forces with Vanguard Group, his wealth had soared, allowing him to purchase several properties.


None of those acquisitions, however, could hold a candle to the villa they had just lost.


A car arrived, and the whole family piled in,settling into a roomy penthouse that, despite its space, felt like a step down.


Scanning the bedroom, Khloe wrinkled her nose. "Mom, is this really supposed to be my room? It's tiny!"


A look of disappointment settled on Elissa's face as well. "Didn't you both buy another villa,Dad?"



Bennie explained, "That place is out in the suburbs. Villas in the heart of the city are almost impossible to find. At least this place is close to your school and sits in a great neighborhood."
Nearly twenty million had gone into securing this address.


Still,Khloe ccouldn't hide her dissatisfaction.



The frustration followed her into the evening.When her scheduled stream rolled around, she skipped going live. Questions poured in from fans, and she didn't hesitate to air her grievances, telling everyone about their eviction.


She and her online followers spent the night hurling insults at Arabella.



Meanwhile, Elissa lingered by the window,struggling to process the upheaval. Only hours before, she had called a grand downtown villa home.Now she stood in a modest penthouse.


There was a time in her childhood when this would have felt like a dream come true.



But after she lived surrounded by luxury, how could this place ever feel like enough?
###Chapter 36 Is There Any Hope For Fresh Investment          
     Losing her place in the dance troupe added another blow to Elissa's already bruised pride.


The root of all these troubles seemed to trace right back to Arabella's unexpected return.


With clenched fists, Elissa entered the living room, finding Bennie mid-discussion with Meagan about the company's troubles.


Frustration weighed heavy in Bennie's voice."Managing this company gets tougher every day," he muttered, sighing in exasperation.


A ripple of anxiety ran through Elissa at his words.


The thought of returning to a life without luxury filled her with dread.


Turning to her father, she asked, "Dad, is there
any hope for fresh investment?"


Bennie shook his head, exhaling smoke."Things get worse with every passing day. If nothing changes soon, we'll be bankrupt before long."


Not ready to give up, Elissa continued, "What about the project I mentioned last time? Have you spoken to anyone about it?"


He nodded wearily. "I did reach out, but hardly anyone believes in it. Banks have turned us down, and even family can't help-your uncles and aunts just don't have the funds."


Panic crept into Meagan's voice. "We can't just let the business go under!"



Elissa cut straight to the point. "Exactly how much cash do we have left to work with?"


Calculating quickly, Bennie answered, "We can scrape together $50 million, at best."


A thoughtful look came over Elissa. "Since the project isn't exactly in demand,competition will
be thin. Vanguard Group isn't expected to bid high either, and their estimate hovered around $80 million. If we can pool just a bit more than that, the contract could be ours."


Turning to her father, she suggested, "Dad, why don't we sell the remaining properties and push our relatives to chip in more? Surely, they're interested in a solid return. This is it-our last shot. Projects that catch Vanguard Group's eye usually multiply their investors' money five or six times over. Are we seriously going to let everything slip away without a fight?"


Bennie found himself leaning toward her plan."You're right. We can't miss this window. I'll start making calls immediately."


Meagan chimed in, eager to help, "I'll see what can get from my circle as well."


Elissa planned to help as well.


Living in this penthouse was only a temporary fix.
With one successful project, their family could move right back into a luxury villa in the city's heart.


Their status would be restored among the elite.



As for Arabella, she would be left behind,saddled with her ailing sister. Once the proceeds from the villa sale dried up, she would have no choice but to get a job-maybe even beg them for work.


That delicious thought brought a satisfied smile to Elissa's face.



Suddenly, something else occurred to her."Dad, do you know what became of Arabella's father's company?"


Curiosity stirred-Elissa tried to recall details about the business Arabella's father had run before his death, wondering how things had turned out for the company he left behind.


Pausing to recall, Bennie finally answered, "After his death, the company just couldn't keep
going. I'm sure it's out of business by now."


A dismissive snort came from Meagan. "Of course it is. If you ask me, he was too tight-fisted with his assets. If he'd handed the company over to us sooner, maybe things would have been different. Family's supposed to help each other, not hoard everything."







Arriving at the villa in Gracebourne, Arabella picked up the sounds of conversation before she even stepped inside.


The sight that greeted her was Dominick and Asher occupying the living room.


A polite greeting came from Dominick. "Good evening,Miss Stanley."


Asher's gaze met hers, but his expression revealed nothing.


Curiosity flickered across Arabella's face. "What brings you here?"
Asher's reply was as cool as ever. "You invited me to crash with you yesterday."


Memory flickered-she did recall saying that,though she hadn't expected him to take her up on it.


Dominick's eyes landed on what she held in her arms. "May I ask what you've brought with you?"


Arabella handed the bundle to a waiting servant."Just some things that belonged to my parents and Daisy."


With a small smile, she suggested, "I was about to start cooking. Since you're both here, why not stay for dinner?"


Dominick didn't hesitate to refuse. "Appreciate the offer, but something urgent just came up at work. I have to run."



He made his exit in a rush, not sparing a backward glance.
Asher's attention drifted from his departing assistant to Arabella. "You know we have a professional chef here," he remarked.


Arabella responded calmly, "What I make is nothing like what the chef prepares-mine is a lot healthier."


Truthfully, she wouldn't have stepped into the kitchen at all if Asher hadn't shown up.


After letting the silence linger, Asher finally gave a nod.


She moved around the kitchen with practiced speed. While they ate, Arabella couldn't help but notice Asher's every gesture-his manners and quiet elegance marked him as someone born into privilege.


A question broke the stillness. "How are you holding up these days?" Asher asked, his gaze steady and unreadable.


The true meaning behind his words was clear to Arabella-he was talking about all the criticism
and rumors. She met his eyes and shook her head. "None of that matters to me."


As dinner ended, Arabella made her way to Daisy's room, where she lifted the lid on a small box and pulled out a photo album.


Despite everything she had endured, Daisy had always kept these albums safe.


Page after page showed a happy family of four.


Softly, Arabella ran her fingers across the smiling faces of her parents. "I'm so sorry,Mom, Dad. I couldn't protect Daisy."


Tears clouded her vision until she could barely see the photographs.



Restless and sorrowful, she wandered back downstairs, grabbed a few bottles of wine, and sat alone with her memories and pictures.


A sudden buzz from her phone interrupted her solitude.
###Chapter 37 Tell Me, Who Are You
Out of nowhere, relatives who hadn't bothered with Arabella in years began texting her one after another.


One message scolded her, "How could you toss your aunt out like that, Arabella? No young woman should behave this way!"


Another scoffed, "Stop being so stubborn,Arabella.Bring your aunt home right now. You're all alone-your aunt is the only family you have left!"


A cold sneer curled on Arabella's lips as she promptly blocked each and every one.


Funny how these people, once so eager for her father's help, now took Meagan's side without hesitation.


Bottle after bottle disappeared, and when her supply ran dry, Arabella made her way
downstairs, the world spinning. She collided with something solid and glanced up-her gaze met a strikingly handsome face.


Concern flickered across Asher's features as he caught the scent of alcohol on her breath and saw the flush on her cheeks. "You've been drinking, haven't you?"


With a soft nod, Arabella let her weight rest against him, her limbs almost boneless.


He reached out to steady her. "Do you think you can stand?"


A barely-there shiver ran through him as her skin brushed against his hand.


Her perfume mingled with the sharp tang of alcohol, creating an unexpectedly alluring blend.


Confusion clouded her expression. "Who are you?" The usual coldness in her features melted into something vulnerable, almost childlike."Tell me.who are you?"
Staring down at her, Asher felt something inside him shift-his heart, usually so guarded,softened in an instant.


A vivid memory returned to him-a rain-soaked kitten he had once rescued, looking every bit as lost as Arabella did now.


Wariness filled the kitten's eyes, its muddy fur clinging to its small body. Still, when he made to leave, it trailed after him, refusing to be left behind.


Bringing the little stray home, he found it grew attached, never straying far from his side.


Sadly, the companionship didn't last-his grandfather soon cast the kitten out, ending their brief bond.


"You're Dad," Arabella whispered, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears.


The words struck Asher dumb for a moment,catching him off guard.
Whatever gentle feeling had crept into his heart evaporated in an instant.


Without a second thought, he hoisted Arabella over his shoulder with ease, carrying her to her room and placing her gently on the bed. "Get some rest."


"No." Arabella resisted, shaking her head.Tears streamed down her face as she gazed up at him."Why did you have to go so soon, Dad?"


Asher was left without words, unsure how to respond.


The sight of her swollen, glistening eyes brought an ache to his chest. Quietly, he murmured, "Maybe I should have found you both earlier."


Much of Arabella's life was a mystery he had tried to unravel-she had vanished from home at twelve, and only resurfaced just as he returned himself.


Where she had been all those years remained a
secret he hadn't cracked.


Still, something about her always hinted at hidden depths-so composed, so wise, and fiercely independent. Yet, beneath that strength, he could sense the scars left by losing her parents so young. And to think-she was only nineteen.


A soft whisper escaped Arabella. "I missed you so much."



Her hand clung tightly to his, warm tears dripping onto his skin, and the touch made his fingers tremble. With gentle care, he brushed her cheek and promised in a quiet voice, saying,"From this moment on, I'll protect you and your sister from all harm."


He remained close, never leaving her side as she finally drifted off to sleep, exhaustion winning out.


With patient hands, Asher pulled the blanket up around her shoulders, ensuring she was
comfortable.


Night faded, and the first rays of morning light crept through the windows, ushering in a new day.


Arabella awoke with a pounding head and quickly/ realized she had overindulged last night.In search of relief, she made her way downstairs, only to find Asher emerging from the kitchen.


He looked particularly striking that morning,dressed in a crisp white shirt and black vest,every detail neat and precise. He handed her a glass. "Here. Drink this."


Grateful, Arabella accepted the water, her cheeks flushing slightly. "I might have had a bit too much to drink last night."


He responded with a nod, not making much of it.


Curiosity nagged at her. "I didn't do anything I'll regret, did l?" She glanced up, searching his
face for answers.


Asher's expression remained steady and unreadable. "Why don't you tell me?"



Before she could say another word, he was already heading for the dining table. "Let's eat.I'll give you a ride to campus after breakfast."


Satisfied that nothing embarrassing had occurred, Arabella let the matter drop.


Once breakfast was finished, Asher drove her straight to Griridge University.


In the last two days, student outrage toward Arabella had only grown louder. The tension reached a peak when Elissa arrived on campus looking fragile and sorrowful, instantly winning over her supporters. Sympathy poured in, and Joyce wasted no time organizing a crowd to rally in front of the college president's office.


"Are we supposed to stand by while someone like Daisy remains at this school?" Joyce asked."If we keep silent, we'll be lumped in with her by
the time we graduate!"


The crowd retorted, "Absolutely not!"


Chants erupted. "Expel Daisy!"


A chorus rang out. "Daisy has no place at Griridge University!"


Elissa intervened, seemingly trying to play peacemaker. "You really don't have to go this far. Daisy's had a hard life-she lost her parents,and that's probably why she acts out..."


Joyce gave Elissa's shoulder a reassuring squeeze, but her eyes glittered with spite."Relax, Elissa. By the end of today, Daisy will be gone for good."
###Chapter 38 Fascinating How You've Twisted Things
Worry flickered in Elissa's eyes, but beneath the surface, she seethed with scorn.


Daisy had struggled to earn her spot at Griridge University. Arabella was gonna ruin her sister's life.


Eventually, all the noise and agitation brought the university president out of his office.


Turning to the newly arrived administrator,Joyce wasted no time. "Sir, when will you be expelling Daisy?"


An eyebrow arched as the president replied,"And what exactly is the reason for her expulsion?"


Anger flashed as Joyce shouted, "She's nothing but an ungrateful, heartless, and cruel person!
Allowing someone like that to stay will only drag down the university's good name!"


Leveling a calm gaze, the president pressed her for proof. "Can you support any of these accusations?"


Without hesitation, Joyce insisted, "Elissa can testify! After Daisy lost her parents, she was taken in by Elissa's family. Instead of showing gratitude, she turned around and bullied her benefactor!"


"Fascinating how you've twisted things. So now,my parents' house magically belongs to Elissa's family?" Arabella's sharp, mocking tone broke through the gathering tension, which made everyone look her way.


The moment Arabella appeared, the temperature in the group seemed to drop,though her words left many of them blinking in confusion.


Joyce wasted no time scoffing, "Your house?
Really, Daisy? Are you hearing yourself?"


A smirk curled across Elissa's lips.



Ownership didn't matter now, anyway-the house was gone, and there was nothing Arabella could show to prove her claim.



Today,Elissa was set on one thing: making sure Arabella couldn't utter a single word in her own defense.


After all, in her mind, Arabella had started it by throwing her and her family out. If she was suffering now, well, Arabella would only brought it on herself.


Elissa wore a look of wounded disappointment but finally found an outlet for her grievances."Family ties matter, yes. Still, Arabella, you can't just say the house is yours. Do you actually have proof?"


With a cool confidence, Arabella reached for her phone. "Who says I don't?"
Right then, a buzz rippled through the crowd as a fresh post appeared on the school forum.


Heads bowed over screens, students exchanged startled glances and tugged friends closer to see the update for themselves.



Bafflement swept over Joyce wvhen she noticed all eyes glued to their phones. Curiosity getting the better of her, she peered at a classmate's display-shock washed over her face the moment she read the post.


Elissa, just as perplexed, felt her own device vibrate. The headline caught her eye. "Who's actually living in my house?"


The attached image left no room for debate-a clear photo of the property deed, Arabella's name shining on the title.


It turned out her parents had purchased the villa using Arabella's name as the owner.



Most of the students had spent time at Elissa's house before, and the address shown in the
post was unmistakably the same.


Nervous whispers erupted.



"Is this real, or did someone just fake it?"


Someone in the crowd chimed in, "You can tell that's real-there's no way it's photoshopped.Does that mean the house actually belonged to Daisy's family? Is Arabella really her sister?"


For a split second, worry flickered across Elissa's face, but she recovered swiftly. "So y/ou think you can trick everyone with a simple post,Daisy? My parents only put the house in Arabella's name out of pity. The villa has always been ours by right!"


The skeptical students, reassured by her confidence,let out a collective breath.



A wave of relief swept through them; it seemed for a moment as if they had almost been misled.


Disdain replaced doubt as they turned cold glances back on Arabella, convinced she was
simply scheming again.


A slow, mocking smile curved Arabella's lips."Do you honestly believe the truth can be buried with time, Elissa? That house belonged to me from the very beginning!"



A quick tap of her finger sent another update live.


A chill crept over Elissa as she scrolled to see the newest edit: the post now displayed a scanned image of the original purchase contract.


Her mind went completely blank, panic rising.


How had Arabella uncovered a document hidden for so long? And if that contract was real, what about the villa-wasn't it supposed to belong to that burly new owner now?



"Elissa, say something! What is this about?"Joyce's voice trembled as she turned anxious eyes to her friend.
Speech deserted Elissa; her lips parted,but nothing came out.


The uncertainty etched across her face sent a ripple of dread through the crowd. Were they the ones who had been fooled this entire time?


"Once my parents were gone, your family seized our home, treated me like a servant, and bullied me because I was just a kid," Arabella declared, sorrow mingling with bitter resentment in her gaze.


Rage flickered beneath her sadness as she locked eyes with the students.


With a swift motion, Arabella tossed a photograph into the air, letting it flutter down for everyone to see.


Curiosity surged as the students leaned in-right there in the center of the faded image stood Daisy, flanked by her parents, their posture proud, and another girl-Arabella herself, her face crudely scratched out.
The whole group looked sophisticated, Daisy's parents radiating class and elegance.


Another family stood beside them, clearly Elissa's family-by comparison, their clothing was simple, the difference unmistakable.


Gasps rippled through the students. "Wow,Daisy's mom was stunning! And her father-he looked so distinguished!"


Recognition dawned in one corner. "Wait a minute, I know Daisy's dad! He worked with my father years ago!"


"So it turns out Elissa's family took over Daisy's house? Where does Elissa get off distorting everything like she's the victim?"


A wave of disbelief washed over Joyce as she studied the photograph in her hand. She fixed Elissa with a wary stare, inching away as if meeting her for the first time. "All this time, have you been feeding me nothing but lies, Elissa?"
###Chapter 39 You're Wrong About Elissa
Wealth was never part of Elissa's background-she had grown up with very little.


Everything she now possessed came from taking over Daisy's rightful home.


As her friends slowly distanced themselves and classmates stared with scornful eyes, a wave of lightheadedness washed over Elissa, and she nearly lost her balance.


Tears spilling down her cheeks, Elissa scoffed,"That's not how it happened!" Her vision blurred as she tried to defend herself, looking the very picture of heartbreak. "We didn't steal the house, and besides, Daisy's parents have been gone for ages. Whatever my parents own now, they built from scratch. Joyce, you've even visited my dad's company, haven't you?"
For a brief moment, Joyce hesitated, then offered a silent nod.


With streaks of tears running down her face,Elissa continued, "Okay, it's true-the house doesn't belong to us. I only claimed it out of loyalty to my parents. When we were younger,my family had less, and Daisy's parents always looked down on us. After they passed, my mom welcomed Daisy and Arabella as if they were her own-sometimes she cared more for them than for me. But all she got in return was their contempt, even violence. Honestly, I let my anger get the better of me and said things l shouldn't have. One little lie turned into a mess l couldn't control. I'm truly sorry for misleading everyone."


As her words trailed off, Elissa buried her face in her hands, shoulders shaking with sobs.



From where she stood, Arabella couldn't help but think Elissa had missed her calling-one speech, and she had nearly swept the whole
crowd back onto her side. Sympathy flickered in Joyce's eyes. "I'm sorry, Elissa. I guess | didn't understand the whole story."


Joyce turned, facing the others. "You're wrong about Elissa. When Daisy arrived at school with a bad reputation, everyone avoided her-everyone except Elissa, who went out of her way to welcome her and encouraged us to do the same.There's no way she's the villain here."


A rush of frustration took hold of Joyce as she realized she had almost been taken in by Daisy as well.



The students looked uncertain, their doubt creeping back in.


"If Elissa's telling the truth, maybe her actions are understandable after all."



"That's right! I remember Elissa sticking up for Daisy back in the day. When Joyce was giving her a hard time, Elissa always stepped in. She's always struck me as a qenuinely good person."
Someone chimed in from the back, "I honestly don't know what to believe anymore, but I still feel like Elissa has a kind heart. Even if that house really belonged to Daisy, I'd take Elissa's side."


Thanks to her careful reputation-building, Elissa had most of the student body in her corner-for now.


Arabella unlocked her phone, intent on taking action, but something on the screen made her pause and arch an eyebrow.


A notification announced, "The school forum has just banned anonymous posting. From now on,every comment and post will display the user's real name."


Timing couldn't have been better for her.



For Arabella, this update was perfect.



Whispers swept through the crowd as more and more students saw the update. A handful went pale, eyes darting nervously to their own
devices.


Still wiping at her tears, Elissa caught a glimpse of Joyce's phone and went rigid. Panic spread across her features as realization hit, draining all color from her face. She frantically searched her bag for her own phone, sweat breaking out on her brow.


"Hold on... you mean Elissa wrote all those nasty posts?" Stepping forward, Kaitlyn began to recite. "'Be wary, Daisy might steal from you.'Daisy is such trash-she's harassing boys again. 'There goes Daisy, bullying Elissa once more. Why can't that girl just disappear already?"


Those messages had been the spark that destroyed Daisy's reputation.



No one had ever suspected who was hiding behind the anonymous account, but those words had been enough to poison everyone against Daisy.
Now, with the new policy in place, the name attached to every message was unmistakable-Elissa.


A cold mood settled over the group as every student began tapping into Elissa's profile, eyes wide with shock and anger.


Nearly every post was either a vicious jab at Daisy or an over-the-top compliment to Elissa herself.



"Seriously, could Daisy be any more revolting?I've caught her leaving hotels with guys more than once. Careful, everyone-you don't want to catch whatever she's spreading."


Another entry read, "Daisy is the worst. Can she just disappear already?"


Bragging posts dotted the thread too. "Look at this unedited shot of Elissa-no filterneeded,she's naturally stunning."



And those were just the beginning.
A heavy silence fell as the crowd scrolled-first shock, then a rush of guilt washed through them.


Realization dawned with horror. Elissa had orchestrated everything from behind the scenes?


All that sweetness had been a mask-Elissa was nothing but a master manipulator, hiding a snake's heart.


A wave of disgust swept through the grouIp;more than one person felt their stomach twist with nausea.


"You're unbelievable, Elissa-how could you stoop so low?" The words rang out as someone hurled a textbook at her, catching her directly in the face. "I actually believed you. I must've been out of my mind!"
###Chapter 40 Will Daisy Ever Forgive Us
Rage erupted among the students as they closed in around Elissa, voices rising in accusation. "How could you do something so heartless,Elissa? I can't believe I was a real big fan of you."


A chill ran through Joyce as her eyes darted from the damning posts to Elissa's stricken face. Step by step, she retreated, voice trembling. "So you're the one who misled me into believing Daisy had feelings for my boyfriend."


She was seething when she saw the post and wanted to face Daisy, but Elissa held her back.



From that instant, she began to despise Daisy.


But she never guessed that Elissa had been pulling the strings all along.
It was too much. Joyce spun on her heel and fled the scene.


Overwhelmed and shamed, Elissa stared at the floor, refusing to meet anyone's gaze.


Kaitlyn, guilt heavy in her tone, addressed Arabella. "I'm sorry. We've judged you so unfairly for so long."


Her apology opened the floodgates. "We're sorry, Daisy," others echoed, regret etched on their faces.


"I always thought you were sweet and beautiful.What Elissa did toyou was just cruel."


Arabella surveyed the crowd, eyes lingering on the remorseful faces, then turned wordlessly and walked away.


A hush fell, replaced by unease. "Will Daisy ever forgive us?"


Frustration boiled over as another voice interjected. "Damn vou. Elissa."
Tempers snapped-a hand flew, landing a sharp slap across Elissa's cheek.


Pain seared through Elissa's cheek as she pressed a trembling hand to her face,stammering out excuses that felI on deaf ears.


Disgust and betrayal radiated from every direction, her classmates glaring at her with open contempt. Her body shook as tears poured down, completely beyond her control.


All the admiration she had spent years cultivating was swept away in a single morning.



Nothing about this outcome made sense-how had everything unraveled so quickly?



Eventually, the university president stepped in,deciding she had faced enough. "That's enough. Let's all settle down and return to your classrooms. Focus on your studies."


With the president's firm tone, the gathering broke up and students drifted away.
Arabella made her way back to her seat.


As she settled in, she noticed a growing pile of small gifts and handwritten notes on her desk.



One message stood out. "We're so sorry, Daisy.We let ourselves be misled."


Another muttered, "Forgive me-l should've intervened when Elissa bullied you."


Other voices chimed in, "You've always been incredible. Watching you suffer while | stayed silent filled me with regret."


One apology after another landed in front of her.


Still, Arabella gave no sign of acknowledgment.She kept her focus on the book in her hands.


Only when someone slid into the seat beside her did she pause. "Once she knows the real story, I bet she'll feel a lot less alone."


Kaitlyn's words carried real sincerity. Arabella's eyes narrowed thoughtfully before she
answered in a calm, even tone, "So you've known the truth this entire time."


"That's correct. While Daisy resembles you,she's never quite matched your presence,"Kaitlyn murmured, sorrow shadowing her gaze."She was always gentle and tender-hearted-nothing like the way you carry yourself."


Hearing this, Arabella paused, reassessing Kaitlyn with new respect. For someone so outwardly soft-spoken, her perception cut deep. Not even Elissa had seen past her facade,yet Kaitlyn had sensed the truth from the very beginning.


After a long absence, Joyce finally slipped into the room. The moment her eyes landed on Arabella, a storm of emotions flickered across her face, but instead of approaching,she retreated to a seat at the farthest edge.


Elissa's desk, by contrast, remained empty.



A silent tension lingered as classmates kept
darting glances between Joyce and Arabella.


Joyce had been Arabella's harshest tormentor.Now that she knew the truth, what would she do next?


Just as the lesson was drawing to a close, a new figure appeared in the doorway,catching the attention of everyone in the room.


"Is that Kenny?"



"He must be looking for Joyce. Kenny hasn't changed a bit-still turning heads wherever he goes."


Arabella's eyes slid toward the door, her expression hardening. That was a face she could never forget-a face she had mentally blacklisted.


Kaitlyn, noticing the shift, leaned in and explained, "That's Kenny Hyde, Joyce's boyfriend. They're known across campus as the golden couple-wealthy backgrounds, admired by everyone. There were even rumors Daisy had
tried to catch his eye."



A cold smirk touched Arabella's lips. "That one?

He is not worthy of my sister."



Excitement flickered in Joyce's expression the moment she spotted Kenny waiting by the door.



The bell barely finished ringing before she hurried over, calling out with barely concealed joy,"Kenny!"
###Chapter 41 You Two Make A Flawless Pair
Kenny's gaze drifted past Joyce and settled on Arabella as she approached. Her delicate features drew him in, and without makeup, her natural beauty struck him with unexpected force. For a moment, he found himself completely captivated.


Joyce caught the direction of his stare, her expression shifting to storm clouds as she raised her voice sharply."Kenny!"


"Hey, baby, you look absolutely radiant today,"Kenny murmured to Joyce, his tone deliberately gentle, his eyes flooding with manufactured affection.



Kenny possessed the kind of handsome features that commanded attention, carrying himself with practiced refinement. Joyce couldn't suppress her smile, but then memory crashed back, and she shot a venomous glare at Arabella as she passed. "Daisy, stop right there."


Throughout the entire class period, Joyce had endured the weight of her classmates' stares-judgmental eyes that seemed to cast her as the
villain in some unfolding drama.


Now, Joyce lifted her chin defiantly and crossed her arms. "Stop putting on this pitiful act. Maybe Elissa fabricated some details, but | certainly didn't invent the part about you throwing yourself at my boyfriend. So quit playing the victim in front of me."


Her accusations left a trail of murmurs rippling through the onlookers.


The truth remained that Elissa had wronged Daisy, but the whispers about Daisy pursuing Kenny had created quite the scandal, and Daisy had never bothered to defend herself.


If those rumors held any truth, Daisy's character was undeniably questionable.


Conflicted emotions flickered across the classmates' faces.


Arabella regarded Kenny with cold indifference."You two make a flawless pair-a jerk and a bitch.Unfortunately, I have no interest in people of Kenny's caliber."


Kenny's and Joyce's faces crumpled simultaneously.


Joyce exploded, "How dare you insult me like
that,you witch?"


Her hand flew up instinctively to strike Arabella,but Kenny intercepted her wrist.


Kenny spoke with calculated softness. "Let it slide, Joyce. She's just a pathetic creature.Everything happened ages ago. Let's consider yourselves even now. Besides, my heart beats only for you."


His honeyed words dissolved most of Joyce's fury. She wound her arm through his and regarded Arabella with triumphant disdain."Humph! Daisy, you had the audacity to chase after my boyfriend. What happened before was my way of teaching you a lesson-now we're square. But if I ever catch you making moves on him again, I won't show such mercy!"
With that declaration, Joyce swept away with Kenny in tow.


The classmates exchanged unreadable glances.


"Even if Daisy didn't torment Elissa, seducing someone else's boyfriend isn't any more respectable."


"We should probably keep our distance from her.She brings nothing but drama."
Kaitlyn suddenly laughed. "Honestly, with Daisy's stunning looks, Kenny doesn't even deserve to breathe the same air as her."


An uncomfortable silence descended until someone muttered, "But he has deep pockets."


Clearly, Joyce's words had swayed a considerable number of people.


Kaitlyn felt ready to shake sense into her classmates, but Arabella had already pivoted to leave,and Kaitlyn scrambled to catch up.


"Don't let them get under your skin. People follow the loudest voice without thinking," Kaitlyn offered gently.


"They're beneath my notice," Arabella replied with serene composure. She understood human nature's weaknesses perfectly, and a message had just arrived requiring her attention elsewhere.


Arabella arrived at the villa where her family used to live, only to discover a mob of protesters gathered outside.


"Return the house to Koko!"



"You shameless woman! Koko's family showed you nothing but kindness, and you betrayed them!"
"To whoever's purchasing Arabella's house, show some decency! That property should never belong to her!"


They maintained their distance while security guards stood helplessly nearby. The crowd wasn't causing major disruption, but they were definitely creating a nuisance.


Koko served as Khloe's online persona.


Over the years, Khloe had cultivated a massive following as a social media influencer, and now was precisely the moment to weaponize their loyalty.


At that moment, Khloe sat comfortably in her car,savoring the spectacle with deep satisfaction.The Internet had rallied overwhelmingly to her cause. Could any buyer withstand this kind of public assault? No rational person would want to wade into such a toxic mess.


The new owner would give up the villa sooner or later.


Meagan practically glowed with excitement. "I never imagined we'd be counting on you this time!"


"Don't fret, Mom. That buyer will surrender the house soon enough," Khloe replied with a
delighted giggle. She studied her reflection in the mirror, fingertips grazing her face tenderly. "I can hardly believe this treatment worked so magnificently. Just a few marks remain, and soon they'll vanish completely."


She was admiring her recovering face when a familiar silhouette caught her eye, and she immediately straightened with interest.


Khloe pulled on a mask, stepped out of the car,and deliberately positioned herself in Arabella's path, projecting her voice for maximum effect."Arabella, what perfect timing. I know you harbor resentment toward me, and the house belonged to you. There's nothing I can do to change that.I just feel terrible for my mother, after everything she sacrificed for you following your parents'tragic death. Even if you won't give the house to us, you should at least acknowledge my mother for all she's done for you."
###Chapter 42 Give Back The House!
Khloe's devoted followers swarmed around her like moths drawn to flame.


Meeting Khloe in person, her followers found themselves mesmerized by her beauty. The mask concealed half her face, making her appear virtually identical to her polished live stream persona.


Then their eyes landed on Arabella, and they became utterly spellbound.


Could this be Koko's cousin?


She was absolutely stunning, She's got this...aura.


She might even outshine Khloe.



Khloe's jaw clenched so tightly her teeth nearly cracked. As someone who had built her entire kingdom on the altar of appearance,watching her own worshippers be lured away by Arabella's natural glow was like swallowing glass. Arabella didn't just turn heads-she shattered egos.


Still, Khloe pasted on a sugary smile, though it tasted bitter. "I really appreciate everyone coming
to stand with me. But rest assured-Arabella knows she messed up."


That single line pulled her followers back to Earth,snappingthe spell. No matter how dazzling Arabella looked, in their eyes, she was still the villain of the story-the one who had turned on her own.


Their expressions hardened into masks of hostility as one of them said, "Koko, we're here to get your house back! You must be Arabella, right?Koko's family sacrificed everything for you,and you threw them out like trash. You have no shame! If you don't return the house to Koko,we're staying here until you do!"


Meagan stepped forward, her face a masterpiece of manufactured helplessness. "Arabella, before your parents died, they begged me to care for you and Daisy. The house was meant as our compensation for that sacrifice. Now that you've grown up, how can you treat me so cruelly? lt breaks my heart!"


She pressed her hand to her chest and released a theatrical sigh. She had spent extra time applying makeup to appear even more worn down today,crafting the perfect image of a woman destroyed by ingratitude.
Since Meagan resembled most of the fans'mothers in age, the crowd's emotions intensified.


Someone hurled their thermos at Arabella,screaming, "You heartless, ungrateful witch! Give the house back to Koko! Without them, you and your sister would have died on the streets!"


Arabella sidestepped the projectile with fluid grace and released a laugh that froze the air around them. She caught the triumphant gleam flickering in Meagan's eyes and spoke with deliberate, cutting slowness. "Aunt Meagan, it seems you truly cannot let go of this house."


Meagan's defensive mask slipped for just a moment. "This isn't about the property. I'm heartbroken by your ingratitude! I raised you and Daisy from children, and you don't have an ounce of appreciation!"


Khloe's fans exploded with renewed fury. "Your aunt showed you such kindness, and this is how you repay her family. You have no conscience at all. You're a despicable person. Go to hell!"


"Exactly, give back the house!"


"She looks decent, but she's rotten to the core!"


The crowd pulsed with dangerous energy, their anger feeding off itself.
Meagan savored the moment, her satisfaction blooming like poison in her chest. She felt certain victory was within her grasp.


She studied Arabella with barely concealed contempt. Arabella's father had possessed real capability, but Arabella was just a girl-how much power could she possibly wield?


Controlling Arabella and Daisy had always been child's play.


But Meagan had made a fatal miscalculation.


"You claim to have cared for us, but honestly, I think you and your family gained far more than we ever did," Arabella said, her voice slicing through the air like a sharpened blade. "After you moved into this house, you built connections throughout the neighborhood. Your company reaped tremendous benefits. Most people only did business with you because of your supposed close relationship with my father."


"What complete nonsense are you spouting?Your father had been dead for years. We earned these connections through our own hard work!"Meagan snapped back, her eyes turning to ice."Arabella, do you honestly think spreading lies will make people believe you?"
"Mrs. Tucker." The voice cut through the tension like thunder.


An elegantly dressed woman approached, her expression darkening as she fixed her gaze on Meagan. "What exactly are you claiming?"


Meagan turned pale. She hadn't expected to run into Gracie Pearson, not here, not today.


Weren't the Pearsons supposed to be out of the country?


"Oh! Mrs. Pearson, you're back?" Meagan stumbled into a smile, the kind meant to smooth over disasters. "It's nothing, really. I had no idea you were back in town-l was just about to visit you!"



Gracie's face remained carved from stone. "What did you just say? I remember making it crystal clear when we worked together that it was solely because of Arabella's father. Otherwise, why would I do business with an insignificant company like yours?"


Gracie's arrival and her devastating words crushed Meagan's confidence and left Khloe's fans reeling in stunned silence.


Arabella's expression softened at the sight of Gracie, warmth breaking through her icy
composure.


Her father had always maintained excellent relationships with everyone in the neighborhood,especially the Pearsons.


Gracie approached Arabella, her eyes brimming with genuine concern. "Arabella, you've finally come home."


"It's been far too long, Mrs. Pearson," Arabella replied, her voice carrying gentle warmth.


"What's all this?" Gracie inquired, her tone sharp with disapproval.


Khloe, feeling utterly humiliated by Gracie's crushing words, whined defensively, "But my parents... they've supported you for years,Arabella. They poured time and money into raising you. How can you be so heartless?"


Before the last syllable left her lips, Arabella hurled a thick stack of papers straight at Khloe's face.


Khloe scrambled to retrieve them from the ground, and her expression transformed into one of pure horror as she absorbed what was written.
###Chapter 43 Prepare Yourself For Legal Action
Khloe's followers snatched up the scattered papers, their curiosity piqued by the unexpected drama.


The documents revealed the shocking truth-detailed records of everything Meagan had secretly sold from within the villa's walls over the years.


Arabella had witnessed these transactions all along but remained silent, dismissing the stolen items as insignificant.


She did the math and found that Meagan had quietly liquidated possessions worth millions.


"Oh my gosh, that's an astronomical amount of money!"


"Their family must be swimming in wealth!"


"Obviously! This happens to be one of the most prestigious neighborhoods in Griridge... Wait,what's happening here, Koko? Did your family actually sell that much valuable stuff?"


Khloe studied the damning records, desperately
wanting to mount a defense but finding herself speechless. She clenched her teeth against the rising fury and forced out the words, "That money went toward supporting you and Daisy! Even if you wave those papers around, it won't change anything!"


"Then you can easily show us the receipts for what you supposedly spent on me and Daisy,right?" Arabella's smile turned glacial.


Meagan's lips quivered uncontrollably.


Arabella stepped closer, her presence commanding. "Can't produce them, can you?Because the food at home arrived fresh from the farm every single day, and all the clothes Daisy and I wore came as gifts from luxury brands.Before my parents departed, they ensured we lacked nothing. You entered our home, savored the finest services money could buy, and never spent a single penny of your own!"


A collective gasp rippled through the assembled crowd.



The followers stared at Khloe and Meagan,completely stunned by this revelation.


Meagan stubbornly attempted to salvage her
position. "But when you girls fell ill, I was the one who nursed you back to health-"


"We maintained a private physician on retainer.I don't recall you providing any care whatsoever,"Arabella interrupted, her voice cutting through the air like a blade. Her lips twisted into a frigid smile. "Previously, I held my tongue because you're my aunt. I knew you were stealing and selling our belongings, but I allowed it to continue.Since you insist on creating this public spectacle,I'm granting you one week to return every stolen dollar. Otherwise, prepare yourself for legal action."


A shadow of dread crossed Meagan's features.Arabella continued relentlessly, "And don't imagine you can escape consequences just because years have passed. Our villa's security system stores footage for seventy years."


Meagan's vision blurred, and she swayed dangerously close to collapse.


Khloe struggled to draw breath.


Damn Arabella! She truly represented their most formidable obstacle.


Khloe,despite her seething anger, noticed the
followers' expressions shifting dramatically."Mom, is this actually true?" she demanded,her voice breaking. "I believed we were the ones covering all the expenses!"


Khloe stared at Meagan in complete disbelief,rage blazing across her features. "I can't believe you even deceived me!"


Meagan opened her mouth but found herself voiceless. Seeing the followers watching intently behind Khloe, she had no alternative but to stammer, "I... I never intended to mislead you.l just wanted to secure the house so our family could live in comfort."


"I'd rather live without such tainted money!"Khloe declared sorrowfully, then turned to address the followers directly. "I'm deeply sorry.I had no knowledge of the truth!"


The followers, who had initially burned with anger,witnessed Khloe's genuine remorse and couldn't bring themselves to condemn her. "It's not your fault,Koko. You're a victim in this situation too."


Arabella scoffed, fixing Meagan wih a withering stare, and spoke softly. "Your family's truly remarkable-you'll sacrifice each other whenever it serves your purposes. Aunt Meagan, I'm giving
you exactly one week. Remember to contact me regarding the money's return."


With those final words, Arabella departed alongside Gracie.


Gracie insisted on treating Arabella to dinner,where she listened intently as Arabella recounted the years of betrayal and manipulation.


Gracie's fury ignited. "Meagan's absolutely a despicable woman, treating you and Daisy so cruelly! It's completely unforgivable. But | was foolish as well. I should have recognized she wouldn't possess the kindness to genuinely care for you two."


Guilt consumed Gracie entirely.


Arabella detected the authentic concern radiating from Gracie's eyes, and for a fleeting moment,she felt disoriented. She hadn't anticipated a neighbor caring so deeply about their welfare.Feeling somewhat uncomfortable, she replied,"Everything's manageable now. I just feel sorry for Daisy."


"If I'd remained in the country during those years,I never would have allowed your aunt to torment her so mercilessly."
Gracie's eyes blazed with profound regret as she continued, "Your father stood apart as genuinely exceptional within that family. Meagan and the other relatives are all thoroughly duplicitous, but he possessed true honesty and remarkable kindness."
Suddenly, Arabella's mind seized upon something Meagan had deliberately mentioned earlier.Her grandfather had raised her father from childhood.


She retained few memories of her grandfather since he passed away shortly after her birth.


But then, why would Meagan reference that detail so intentionally?



Could it possibly mean that her father wasn't actually born a Stanley?


Arabella's eyes narrowed as a profound sense of loss washed over her consciousness. Still, it hardly mattered anymore. Her parents had vanished from this world.


"You and Daisy are genuinely good girls. Now that I've come back, if you ever require assistance,simply reach out to me. Let's exchange our contact information."


Gracie and Arabella swapped their details with
practiced efficiency.


A moment later, Arabella's phone chimed with an incoming transfer of two hundred thousand dollars. She frantically attempted to return the substantial sum, but Gracie remained adamant and said, "Your father provided my family with immeasurable help over the years. Please accept this and use it to properly care for Daisy, won't you? If you refuse, it'll signal that you don't wish to maintain our connection."


Witnessing Gracie's unwavering determination,Arabella found herself with no alternative but to accept the generous gesture. "Thank you so much,Mrs.Pearson."


Gracie's face illuminated with a deeply gratified smile.


But precisely at that moment, her phone erupted with an urgent ring. Gracie's expression transformed drastically as she absorbed the caller's words, and when she finally ended the call, she spoke with barely contained urgency."Something critical has emerged. I may not be able to continue our dinner together after all."
###Chapter 44 Were You Hoping To Find Me Here
"It's fine. Would you like a ride? Where do you need to go?" Arabella offered, grateful she had driven her car today.


"Yes, thank you so much," Gracie replied, her fingers gripping her purse with white-knuckled intensity.


The destination wasn't far from where they stood.It was situated in Griridge's prime commercial district, dominated by three towering glass monuments that pierced the skyline-architectural marvels that had become the city's most recognizable landmark.


Arabella had always admired Gracie's reputation as a formidable businesswoman.


Yet now, deep lines of worry carved themselves into Gracie's features, transforming her usual confidence into something fragile and strained.


Remembering the treasured friendship Gracie had cultivated with her parents over the years,Arabella ventured gently, "Has something happened?"
"There's no point in hiding it from you. My business has expanded internationally over the past decade, but I returned home for something crucial-a partnership opportunity with the Gordon Group," Gracie explained, her voice carrying a note of pride that flickered like a candle in the wind before dimming. "However, Mr.Gordon's assistant contacted me earlier. Our proposal has been compromised. Another company submitted something nearly identical."


"I know you would never steal someone else's work," Arabella declared with unwavering conviction.



Gracie released a weary sigh, her shoulders sagging under an invisible weight. "The other company plagiarized our ideas. But given Mr.Gordon's reputation, even when we're the victims, he'll interpret it as our failure to protect our own interests."


No wonder Gracie appeared on the brink of collapse, drowning in circumstances beyond her control.


The Gordon Group commanded such influence that countless firms would sacrifice anything for even a chance at collaboration.


Arabella pressed the accelerator, navigating
through traffic with determined efficiency to reach the Gordon Group building as swiftly as possible.


Gracie disappeared into the elevator while Arabella remained outside the building,her attention suddenly captured by an unwelcome but familiar presence.
much more entertaining challenge.


"I know you've been struggling lately," Kenny said, his tone shifting to mock sympathy. "Choose me, and I'll make your problems disappear."


Kenny dismissed Arabella's words entirely,refusing to acknowledge her rejection.


He had convinced himself that she must have come seeking him out.


Arabella studied Kenny with barely concealed disgust, her stomach churning with revulsion.


How could such a worthless creature ever deserve someone as pure as Daisy?


Then realization struck her like lightning."What brings you to this building?"


"Haven't you heard? I'm here to finalize a collaboration agreement with the Gordon Group,"Kenny announced, his chest swelling with unearned pride.


The pieces fell into place with sickening clarity.The thieves who had stolen the proposal belonged to the Hyde family.


Without wasting another second, Arabella spun on her heel and strode toward the building's entrance.
Kenny's voice echoed behind her in the cavernous lobby. "Wait, Daisy, where do you think you're going? They'll never let you past security!"


He had arrived with his father but had been relegated to waiting outside like a discarded afterthought.


Inside the polished lobby, Arabella encountered Dominick, whose eyebrows lifted in genuine surprise. "Miss Stanley."


"Would it be possible to speak with Asher?"Arabella asked, though hesitation colored her words.


"Certainly. Please allow me to escort you,"Dominick replied with professional courtesy.


They ascended to the thirtieth floor in comfortable silence.


"Mr. Gordon is currently engaged in client negotiations," Dominick explained as they reached their destination. "Please make yourself comfortable in his office, Miss Stanley."


Arabella felt urgency building like pressure in her chest. She had been unaware of Gracie's competitor's identity before, and now everything made perfect sense. The Hydes, with their documented history of unethical business
practices, had undoubtedly stolen the proposal.Perhaps she could present the truth directly to Asher and change the outcome.


"Is there something troubling you, Miss Stanley?"Dominick inquired, noticing the tension that had settled across Arabella's features.


Arabella pressed her lips together, preparing to respond when the conference room doors swung open and Asher emerged. His imposing figure commanded immediate attention, while his chiseled features remained carved from stone.The moment his gaze found Arabella, surprise flickered briefly in his eyes. His voice resonated with authority when he spoke. "What brings you here?"


Gracie appeared close behind him, her expression broadcasting defeat-clearly the meeting had concluded disastrously.


Beside Gracie stood a man. Arabella assumed that he might be Kenny's father, Hayden Hyde,whose face bore the same dissatisfaction.


Hayden addressed Asher with forced politeness."Mr. Gordon, I sincerely hope we'll have opportunities to collaborate in the future."


Asher didn't acknowledge Hayden's existence,
prompting the older man to depart with wounded pride burning in his wake.


"Did you want something?" Asher inquired,his penetrating gaze noting Arabella's continued silence with growing curiosity.


"I have reason to believe the Hydes plagiarized the proposal. I'm personally acquainted with their family's character. Mr. Hyde's son terrorized my sister in school," Arabella explained, her voice gaining strength with each word. "They've built their reputation on questionable business practices and outright theft."


As she spoke, Arabella retrieved her phone,prepared to present the evidence she had gathered.


Gracie felt her heart warm at Arabella's fierce loyalty,though despair continued to weigh heavily on her spirit. Asher's reputation for inflexibility was legendary-he had never bent his principles for anyone.


True to his nature, Asher responded, "I understand your concerns. There's no need to show me your evidence."


Gracie's heart plummeted toward her feet.


Hope had been nothing more than a cruel illusion.
Asher never made exceptions, regardless of circumstances or compelling arguments.



In his worldview, the person who allowed their plans to be stolen bore equal responsibility/with the actual thief.



"Return tomorrow morning," Asher said, his attention shifting to Gracie.
###Chapter 45 | Just Wanted To Express My Gratitude
Gracie stood frozen, her mind struggling to process what she had just witnessed. Had she actually heard correctly? She watched in stunned silence as Asher's imposing figure disappeared through the president's office doors, his cold demeanor leaving an unsettling chill in the air.


She turned to Arabella, her expression glazed with disbelief. "Mr. Gordon actually said yes?"


Dominick's smile radiated warmth as he nodded."Absolutely. We'd like you here tomorrow to hammer out the specifics."


Arabella's eyes sparkled with triumph. "You pulled it off,Mrs.Pearson."


"I can't wrap my head around this." Gracie shook her head, bewildered. "Everyone painted Mr.Gordon as this impossible man to work with.Where did all those stories even come from?"


"Sometimes you have to take the leap to discover what's waiting on the other side," Arabella replied, her voice carrying quiet wisdom.
Overwhelmed with gratitude, Gracie swept Arabella into a fierce embrace, pulling her close until Arabella's cheeks flushed crimson. She gently extracted herself from Gracie's enthusiastic grip. "You've got more pressing matters to handle now, Mrs. Pearson."


Understanding flashed across Gracie's face,and her expression hardened with determination."You're absolutely right. Someone's going to answer for sabotaging my proposal."


Once Gracie departed, Arabella lingered behind and slipped into Asher's office.


The opulent space seemed to amplify Asher's commanding presence, surrounding him with an aura of sophistication that spoke of generations of refined breeding and power.


"Mr. Gordon," she began tentatively.


His eyes flicked up from his papers, irritation flickering across his features. "I'm not signing your paychecks."


Heat crept up her neck as she realized her mistake. Being in his corporate domain had triggered the formal address without thinking."Asher?"


The tension in his shoulders eased slightly, and
something softer flickered behind his guarded expression, though his voice remained glacial."Have those campus rumors been dealt with?"


"Everything's settled now. Your decision to implement real-name verification on the scho0forum made my job infinitely easier." A genuine smile curved her lips, transforming her features into something almost ethereal.


Something stirred in his chest before he deliberately looked away. "Gracie's situation is handled as well. Was there something else you needed?"


"Nothing more. I just wanted to express my gratitude."


"Save your thanks. If she lacked competence,l wouldn't have given her the opportunity," he replied with characteristic bluntness.


"I have complete faith she'll exceed your expectations. I've watched her work since I was a little girl-she's got an instinct for business that's almost supernatural," Arabella said, her voice carrying deep conviction.


"Fine." His response came clipped and final, as always.


wry get out of your way then."
Arabella had barely taken two steps when his voice stopped her cold."Are you heading home?"


"Yes."


"Give me ten minutes. I'll head back too."



"But I brought my own car."


"Dominick can handle yours."



She paused mid-stride, somethingin his tone making her reconsider. After a moment's hesitation, she settled onto the leather sofa to wait.


The moment she sat down, Daisy's phone buzzed against her leg.


Arabella had taken Daisy's device to better understand her situation, though she had no intention of violating her privacy by reading personal messages.


The text was from Kenny. "Just say the word and I'm there,baby."


The saccharine endearment made her skin crawl.


She fired back, "Maybe channel that energy into saving your family's company from bankruptcy."


Kenny's responses came rapid-fire. "Our company's thriving!"
"Didn't I mention? We're about to seal a partnership with the Gordon Group."


"Don't stress-you're still the one who has my heart."


What a jerk.


Arabella pocketed the phone, her attention shifting to Asher as he pressed his fingers against his temples.


Hours hunched over documents had clearly taken their toll, leaving him drained and tense.


She rose and approached him from behind. The instant her hand made contact with his shoulder,he seized her wrist with crushing force.


He spun around, and at the sight of Arabella, he immediately loosened his grip. "My apologies.Occupational hazard.What's wrong?"


"You looked exhausted. I know some massage techniques that might help," she said, flexing her fingers where his grip had left marks.


He studied her intently, regret shadowing his features. "It's unnecessary."


"You can keep working. Just let me try this-l used to do this for my father when he was worn down from long days."
The mention of her father reminded him of the night when she got wasted.


His face darkened.


As Arabella worked her fingers into his tense muscles, she noticed his increasingly stormy expression. Apparently, his standards were impossibly high.


She kept her eyes averted from his documents,concentrating solely on the massage.


Despite her delicate appearance, her touch carried surprising strength and precision.


Asher felt his rigid muscles gradually surrender under her skilled hands as they worked across his back and shoulders. Her technique was undeniably professional, and her subtle perfume clouded his senses.


He somehow felt turned on.


"Mr. Gordon." Dominick entered carrying a stack of documents, then froze as if he had walked into an alternate reality.


Arabella was actually touching Asher? The same man who recoiled from any female contact?


Dominick's mind reeled as he tried to process the impossible scene before him.
He quickly collected himself, set down the papers, and began, "About tonight's event schedule-"


"Move it to tomorrow. I'm leaving in five minutes."Asher cut him off decisively.


Dominick felt his jaw nearly hit the floor.


What had happened to the workaholic who used to practically live at the office? The man who had once spent an entire month sleeping on his office couch during a major project?


Now he was rushing home-and the reason was standing right there. Dominick couldn't help stealing another glance at Arabella, finally understanding the seismic shift in his boss's priorities.
###Chapter 46 Let Me Sing It For You Now
Asher's glacial stare pierced through Dominick,who immediately dropped his gaze in deference."Understood, Mr. Gordon. I'll handle it immediately."


Reading the charged atmosphere with practiced ease, Dominick retreated swiftly from the room.


Arabella remained unaffected by the exchange.She refused to indulge in the fantasy that Asher's actions stemmed from concern for her.Whatever motivated him belonged to his own agenda entirely.


Five minutes stretched past before Asher rose from his chair, and together they made their way back to the villa.


Following dinner, Arabella slipped quietly into Daisy's room.



Her fingertips traced the delicate curve of Daisy's cheek with reverent tenderness. The wounds that had once marred her body showed promising signs of healing, and her skin had regained its natural warmth-a ghost of the vibrant, spirited girl she had once been.
Arabella's voice emerged as barely more than a whisper as she shared fragments of their past,desperate to reach whatever remained of Daisy's consciousness. "This melody was always your favorite. Let me sing it for you now."


She activated the musical accompaniment on her phone and allowed her voice to flow into the silence.


Her ethereal, crystalline tones embraced the room, weaving an atmosphere of profound tranquility and haunting beauty.


In bygone days, Arabella would provide the melody while Daisy transformed it into graceful movement.


Those precious moments felt like lifetimes ago now.



Arabella had cultivated her singing abilities primarily for Daisy's joy, knowing how deeply her sister cherished music despite her own struggles with vocal performance.


Now Daisy remained motionless against the pillows, only the faint tremor of her eyelashes betraying any sign of life.


After several more songs and gentle whispered conversations, Arabella suddenly realized how
long she had neglected her Bluecloud presence.


Bluecloud had revolutionized short-form video content, capturing global attention with unprecedented speed. Arabella had begun sharing vocal techniques through the platform almost accidentally, never anticipating the substantial following that would emerge. The unexpected success had led her to experiment with live streaming sessions, where she guided aspiring singers through various exercises and techniques.


The realization struck her that weeks had passed since her last live broadcast, prompting her to log into her account immediately.





Across the city at the Tucker family's residence,Khloe stormed through the front door in a tempest of fury, her rage finding outlet as she sent an expensive vase crashing against the living room floor.


"Mother, how could Arabella possibly possess those documents?" Khloe's voice cracked with the intensity of her anger, her chest constricting painfully. She had approached this confrontation with absolute certainty that they would reclaim the house, yet not only had they failed
spectacularly, but they now faced an enormous financial penalty.


For their family's strained resources, this sum represented the very threshold of their financial capabilities.


Meagan's expression reflected equal measures of frustration and disbelief. "How could I have anticipated such cunning? Arabella has proven herself far more calculating than I ever imagined."


At that moment, Elissa crossed the threshold into their home.


"Elissa!" Khloe's eyes blazed with sudden hope.She was aware of her sister's superior intellect and strategic thinking. "Were you successful in reclaiming your position within the dance troupe?"


Elissa lifted her gaze, revealing eyes rimmed red from recent tears.



Her obvious distress caught them both off guard completely.


Meagan stepped forward with maternal concern etched across her features. "What has happened to you?"


Elissa's composure crumbled as she recounted
the humiliating events that had transpired at school. Both Meagan's and Khloe's expressions darkened with each devastating detail.


Khloe's fury erupted like a volcano. "Mom, I warned you repeatedly-we should have eliminated them permanently years ago. If we had destroyed those two wretched bitches when they were still vulnerable, they never would have grown strong enough to stand in our way."


Meagan's voice rose to a shriek. "What have I done to deserve this?"


"That infernal Arabella!" Khloe spat her name like poison.


Elissa drew a shuddering breath, fighting for composure. "Mom, how did your confrontation proceed?"


Meagan and Khloe exchanged meaningful glances before Khloe launched into a detailed account of their defeat, her voice trembling with barely contained rage. "What options remain to us now, Elissa? We cannot surrender that money to Arabella. If we comply with her demands, what resources will we have left for our own survival?"


Elissa felt the room spinning as waves of fury crashed over her consciousness.
She struggled to comprehend how their circumstances had deteriorated so catastrophically. Just one month prior, they had commanded respect and wielded significant influence over others. Now they found themselves relegated to the depths of desperation.


Elissa forced herself to breathe deeply before fixing her gaze upon Meagan. "Mom, accompany me to my room. I have something for you."


Khloe's curiosity flared immediately. "What secrets are you keeping? Why can't I participate in this conversation?"


"Your understanding will come in due time," Elissa replied firmly, guiding Meagan toward the bedroom.


Meagan followed with mounting confusion. "What matter requires such secrecy, Elissa?"


Elissa's voice dropped to barely above a whisper,"Arabella's father shared no genuine blood relation with you, did he?"


Meagan's shock manifested as a sharp intake of breath."How did you discover this truth?"



Meanwhile, Khloe remained oblivious to their private discussion, finding the empty living room
insufferably dull as she retreated to her own quarters.


Her first instinct led her directly to the mirror.


She studied the pale scars that marked her face,wondering if paranoia was clouding her judgment,but the marks appeared to have deepened in color and prominence.


Khloe's brow furrowed with subtle displeasure.Her phone's shrill ring shattered the moment.It was a friend from her live streaming network calling. "Khloe, have you checked Bluecloud today?" The voice bubbled with barely contained excitement.


"What's happening? I haven't logged on yet,"Khloe responded, her tone flat with disinterest.


"The legendary music virtuoso A.S. has gone live!" her friend practically shrieked with enthusiasm.


Khloe's skepticism rang through her voice."That's impossible. She hasn't appeared online for nearly a year."
"I'm telling you the truth!" Her friend's excitement reached fever pitch. "She's absolutely extraordinary. The moment she started her stream, the viewer count exploded past one
hundred thousand. She's handpicking people to join her broadcast and providing personalized vocal coaching. We need to get in that queue immediately! If fate smiles on us and we're chosen,the follower surge will be astronomical!"


This represented every content creator's ultimate fantasy-organic traffic delivered without effort or expense.



Khloe's fingers flew across her phone as she logged into Bluecloud and navigated to the live stream room.


The injustice of it all gnawed at her relentlessly.She had sacrificed countless hours and endless energy to cultivate her million-follower base, yet A.S. had achieved tens of millions with nothing more than sporadic singing tutorials and infrequent live appearances.


The disparity filled Khloe with corrosive envy that burned through her chest.


Being selected to perform alongside A.S. during a live broadcast guaranteed instant viral fame and recognition.


She recalled the legendary case of one content creator who had gained over one hundred thousand new followers in a single night after
being chosen for such an opportunity.


"Your vocal technique exhibits excessive tension.Allow your voice to flow more naturally." A composed, melodious female voice drifted from the computer speakers. A.S.'s live stream maintained a minimalist black background,yet her voice possessed an almost hypnotic quality that seemed eerily familiar.


Khloe's frown deepened as she struggled to identify the voice that stirred something unsettling in her memory, though the connection remained frustratingly elusive.
###Chapter 47 Competition Scares Me
Khloe dismissed the thought, convincing herself that every enchanting voice probably sounded the same after a while.


At that moment, her phone screen glowed. A notification popped up. She had just been invited by A.S. for a live session.


"Hi there! Is there a song you're hoping to sing?"came A.S.'s voice from the speakers.


Khloe's image filled the screen. She covered her mouth,stunned. "Wait, did you really pick me?"


The chat exploded with excitement.


"Hold on, is that Koko? Both of my favorite streamers in one place?!"


"Koko always blows me away. A.S. can just chill and vibe along!"


"Been waiting for Koko to sing!"


A.S. asked once more, her tone as cool as before,"Which song are you choosing?"


With a smile, Khloe answered, "I'll go with Walking with You!"
"That song hits some serious high notes," A.S said.


Khloe's confidence didn't waver. "I'm up for it."


"Nobody can top Koko's high notes!"


"I'm sneaking this stream at work. Go get 'em,Koko!"



"A.S. sounds incredible as always."


Music started playing as Khloe set up her track and got ready.


No one could deny her gift for singing. Her fan count spoke for itself.


As the song reached its peak, Khloe poured her heart into every note. Comments flooded in,overflowing with admiration. She felt a rush of satisfaction.


"Enough!" A.S. interrupted, her voice cutting through the music.


A slight chill hung in the air as she spoke."Singing high notes isn't just about hitting them for show. You're off-key. Honestly, your performance is all over the place."


The blunt critique made Khloe's smile falter.Embarrassment prickled as the viewers watched.
She forced herself to stay calm. "Then how am l supposed to sing it?"


"If you want to get better, you have to go back to basics. Practice your vocal warm ups every day.Right now, your fundamentals are weak, and bad habits are holding you back. Unless you fix that,you'll never get anywhere. Try following my warmups for starters," A.S responded.


Unbelievable.


Was this person even qualified to judge?


Frustration bubbled up inside Khloe,but she had no other choice except to do as instructed. Still,she couldn't get her voice to sound right, no matter how hard she tried. With every failed attempt, A.S.'s patience wore thinner. "If you refuse to change the way you sing, there's nothing I can do for you. I'm ending the call."


Just as A.S. was about to leave the stream, Khloe scoffed,"Is that so?"


Her mood soured. "I came here because I respect you, A.S. I wanted to learn something new. But you make it sound like I have no talent at all.Maybe you didn't know, but I took third place in a major singing competition!"


Landing third place had cost Khloe more than a
little cash, but no one could deny the size of her loyal following. That crowd had gathered because she could actually sing.


Scrolling through the comment feed, frustration started to bubble up among her fans.


"I actually thought Koko did great. Isn't A.S. being way too critical?"


"Seriously, there's no reason to drag Koko down like that."


Some stranger on the stream piped up. "A.S. has always been tough on people. Honestly, Koko's voice lacks proper training. I'm studying vocal performance myself. Trust me, A.S. is spot-on."


"If you can't handle honest feedback, just stay out of A.S.'s live sessions! I can't believe some influencers even try to compete with her."


"A.S., next time, you should skip connecting with influencers like that. They're just clout-chasing,not interested in actually learning."


Reading these comments, Khloe felt her cheeks burn. She had never been shamed like this before, not once in all her years on Bluecloud.Fury flared up as she typed, then she scoffed at the screen. "You talk like you're an expert, but where's your performance? I've been at this for
years. What gives you the right to judge me?Want to settle it live? Let's see which of us the viewers prefer."


Right away, the chat went wild.


"This just got interesting! I want to see them go head-to-head!"


"Funny how A.S. posts all these technique tutorials, but I've never heard her sing an entire song. This is the chance."


"A battle of influencers? Don't do it, A.S.! Koko,you can't just challenge someone like her!"


Messages poured in, each person choosing a side.


Watching A.S. say nothing only made Khloe more certain that the so-called expert was just bluffing.


A.S.had even dismissed her voice as worthless.


Today feIt like the day to call out a fraud.


The sting of being set up by Arabella earlier had faded away, replaced by something electric.


If she managed to expose A.S., her followers would definitely grow. She couldn't help but laugh, eyes shining. "You're just pretending.Those tutorials are probably copied from
somewhere. If you could actually sing, why would you be scared of a real contest?"


A.S. answered, "You got me. Competition scares me."


Khloe was about to grin, but A.S. calmly continued, "But if we're being real, beating you wouldn't prove anything. Everyone would expect me to win anyway."


Hearing this, Khloe's temper snapped. She replied, "If you do win, I'll give you a public apology.Does that sound fair?"


"Is your apology even worth anything to me?"A.S.retorted, clearly unimpressed.


Khloe pressed on, "Then what is it you want?"


A.S. responded without missing a moment,"Honestly, is there anything you could offer that I'd actually want?"


Frustrated, Khloe thought for a second before saying, "Here's an idea. If you win, l'll do anything you ask, no questions asked. But if I win, you have to finally admit that all you have are flashy techniques and nothing more!"
###Chapter 48 Care To Say A Few Words
A.S. let out a nonchalant sigh, her words lazy."Deal."



Khloe's lips curled with satisfaction. She was barely able to hide her excitement as their singing duel kicked off. "So what's the plan? Duet, or are we going solo?"


"Either way. Doesn't bother me." Still unfazed,A.S.shrugged.


Assuming A.S. was just fronting, Khloe couldn't resist pushing further. "Let's make it a duet,then.Got any favorites?"


Unbothered, A.S.waved a hand. "You decide."


Khloe wasted no time, queuing up the song she always used to show off her range. It was a tough,high-energy piece-her specialty.


The room began buzzing with anticipation.


Someone in the crowd leaned over. "Isn't Khloe stacking the odds with that one?"


"Hey, she gave A.S. the chance to choose. If A.S.crashes and burns, it's on her."
"A.S. is a powerhouse-just watch. She's got this."


"Well, finally! Thanks to Koko, we're getting to see A.S.really go all out."


Khloe seized the moment, belting out the song's highest, flashiest notes, leaving the onlookers wide-eyed.



Many eyes rolled at her antics.


"Classic Khloe. Too scared to lose, so she grabs the spotlight for herself. What's she trying to prove?"


"A.S. isn't even making a fuss-so why are her followers so riled up? Are you all just here to cheerlead?"


"Clearly you're tone-deaf. A.S.'s talent leaves Khloe in the dust!"



That fired up another reply, saying, "If A.S's all that, she'll crush it-big note or not. Save the complaints for someone else!"


As soon as the music began, the comments section exploded with arguments and opinions.


Launching into the first verse, Khloe hit her stride and delivered her trademark performance,racking up over fifty thousand reward points
within seconds.


Every single point represented a real dollar.


Seeing Khloe's tally skyrocket, A.S.'s fans could only hold their breath and watch.


Once Khloe finished, the room shifted. Suddenly,a voice floated out-warm as sunlight, tender as a breeze, carrying a hush through the entire crowd.


For a heartbeat, the comments vanished into silence.


A.S.'s melody wrapped around every listener, a gentle caress that soothed and captivated,threading straight through their hearts.


It felt like true enchantment.


Normally, A.S. limited herself to the occasional demo during coaching sessions, but this was different. Tonight, it felt like the world had been invited to her private concert.


Khloe was taken aback by A.S's performance.Only the flood of comments jolted her back into focus,but she was already a beat behind.


Panic clouded her mind, making it hard to stay on track.


Praise for A.S. poured in. "That's pure gold right
there! A.S.'s voice just became my new ringtone."


One fan finally got it. "No wonder A.S. rarely performs-after just a few notes, I'm addicted."


Others couldn't help but gloat. "Whoever doubted A.S. must be embarrassed!"


Irritationsimmered in Khloe as she watched the chat light up.


Sure, A.S. had a pretty voice-smooth,emotional,all the right elements-but it was style over substance.


Everyone was being played.


When A.S.'s reward points started climbing rapidly, anxiety gripped Khloe. She hurried off a text to her agent for support.


After all, Khloe was signed to a major agency-they were supposed to back her up in moments like this.


When the chorus hit its highest note, Khloe went all out, belting with everything she had, hoping to turn the tide.


Her total jumped, inching past Arabella's once more.


Suddenly,the chat flooded with enthusiastic-and
suspiciously coordinated-support.


"Look at Koko go! A.S. is just about the pretty tone and cheap feels, but Koko's got serious talent!"


"As a music major, I can say for sure-Koko's technique is rock solid. That other girl? All hype,no skill!"


One viewer said, "I'm no expert, but Koko sure sounds impressive."


Waves of paid comments began shaping the chat,and soon the casual audience was left second-guessing their own ears.


Then, out of nowhere, A.S.'s vocals floated through again, snapping the crowd back into a kind of trance.


Confusion flickered in the chat. "Who are you kidding? No technique? How else is A.S. making everyone feel like this?"


"Honestly, Koko's supporters must be wearing blinders."


"Is critical thinking just gone now? A.S.is the only one giving us real music!"


A.S.'s supporters grew restless. Despite her next-level talent, Khloe's reward score soared-her
total was now double A.S.'s, an eye-popping five million.


With only seconds left on the clock, it looked like A.S. would walk away empty-handed.


Back in her roomn, Arabella took in the scoreboard with unreadable calm, not a flicker of emotion crossing her face.


She had seen enough to know that most of Khloe's votes were probably fueled by her agency's wallet.


Although the platform claimed half of every dollar,agencies often got a percentage back-so those big numbers weren't as costly as they looked.


As the last notes faded, leaving only the instrumental outro, Khloe shot a sweet smile at the camera. "Well, A.S., looks like it's your turn to face the music. Care to say a few words?"
###Chapter 49 We Need To Pay Arabella Back



A.S.'s fans erupted with righteous fury at Khloe's brazen provocation.



"This is absolute garbage! Anyone with eyes can see A.S. destroys Koko!"



"God, I'm broke or l'd send more. Don't worry,A.S.-you'll always reign supreme in our hearts!"



"I literally sent next month's pocket money, but it's still a drop in the bucket..."



Arabella scrolled through the comments, her chest tightening with unexpected emotion.



She understood that most of her supporters were students scraping together allowances,with a few struggling artists thrown into the mix.Managing to raise over two million demonstrated incredible dedication from people who had so little to give.



Khloe had only reached five million thanks to her agency's financial backing-essentially corporate manipulation disguised as grassroots
support.



Khloe's smirk widened as her mask of false modesty finally slipped away. "Clock's ticking.Five seconds left. Why not bow out gracefully and spare everyone the embarrassment?"



The words had barely left her lips when she erupted into laughter. But her triumph lasted exactly one heartbeat before the screen exploded with an avalanche of virtual gifts.



A.S.'s tip counter rocketed to twelve million in an instant.



One mysterious benefactor had just dropped ten million without hesitation.



The final tally blazed across the screen: A.S. at twelve million, Koko limping behind at just over five million.



A.S. had crushed her competition.



Khloe's expression transformed into a grotesque mask of disbelief.



After a moment of stunned silence, the chat erupted into chaos.



"10 million?! I need someone to pinch me!"
"Holy hell, A.S. just landed herself a whale!What kind of billionaire did she hook?"



"This has to be rigged! A.S. obviously bought fake tips!"



"Oh, like Koko's 5 million was totally organic?Please."



"A.S. is untouchable!"



Arabella stared at the screen in genuine shock.She had been preparing to tip herself from her alternate account when someone had beaten her to the punch.



Ten million dollars from a single supporter. Who possessed that kind of casual wealth?



"Well," she said, her voice cutting through the digital pandemonium like ice, "I believe we have our answer."



Khloe's face contorted with rage before she remembered the thousands of eyes watching her every move. "I... I underestimated you. You got me. What's my punishment?"



"I've heard some interesting stories about you occupying your cousin's family mansion. Her
parents died, and after you and your family moved in, your parents sold off everything valuable inside. Your family made promises about compensation." Arabella's tone carried the sharp edge of barely contained fury. "Since we're here competing, why don't you honor those promises right now? Let everyone witness your family's integrity."



"Wait, is this actually true?" someone typed frantically.



"You must be new to Koko's drama. This story's been circulating for months."



"Dear God, are her parents really that heartless?"



Terror and humiliation warred across Khloe's features, but she managed to force out a wveak response. "My parents are... they'restill gathering the funds."



"Really? Over $10 million is taking this long to collect? You've been streaming for years.You can't scrape together a few hundred thousand?"Arabella's voice dripped with contempt.



Khloe's teeth worried her lower lip. "I've
contributed what I could, butit's not enough yet. Once I raise the rest, my parents will pay her back completely!"



"How convenient." Arabella's laugh held no warmth. "I'm starting to think your famnily targets your cousin precisely because she's alone and defenseless. With all the properties your family owns, you could sell a few to raise the money instantly. You simply choose not to."



The accusation ignited a firestorm in the comments.



"A.S. nailed it. Koko just earned $2 million from this competition. How is $10 million suddenly impossible?"



"It's not about capability-it's about willingness.We're talking about $10 million!"



"Koko claims ignorance? She's lived in that house for years! Who's she trying to fool?"



"I've followed Koko forever. She wouldn't do something this cruel. Give her a chance to explain herself properly!"
Khloe felt the walls closing in around her. She recognized the trap-refuse, and her influencer career would crumble to dust before her eyes.



"I'll gather the money! I swear I'll pay my cousin back as soon as possible!" Khloe's voice cracked with barely restrained fury.



"And exactly when might that be?"



"Within a week!" The words escaped her lips before she could stop them-a desperate promise born from having no alternatives left.


The comment section shifted toward cautious optimism. Arabella released a quiet laugh and severed the audio connection from her live stream.



She gave advice to another couple of fans after they sang before finally ending the broadcast, then immediately attempted to contact the mysterious benefactor who had dropped ten million without hesitation. The username displayed only as a generic system-generated identifier.
A.S. typed a direct message through the platform. "I'll return the money to you."



Silence stretched across the digital void.



Arabella logged off shortly after, her mind already calculating the next moves.



She understood that pursuing legal channels would consume precious time-months that the Tuckers might use to declare bankruptcy and vanish with whatever assets remained.



But now, with a ton of fans scrutinizing Khloe's every move, the pressure would force action far more quickly than any lawyer could manage.


She gazed down at Daisy with tender determination. "Everything stolen from us will find its way home,Daisy."



Satisfaction settled in Arabella's chest like warm honey, but across town, Khloe was drowning in an avalanche of private messages, each one demanding immediate payment.



A scream tore from her throat as she hurled her
phone across the room. "Damn you,A.S.!"




"What's all this shrieking about?" Elissa burst through the door with Meagan trailing behind,both wearing expressions of irritation.




The memory of her public promise crashed over Khloe like ice water, and she swallowed hard against the rising panic in her throat. "Mom,Elissa...we need to pay Arabella back. Soon."
###Chapter 50 Let Me Take Your Place



Elissa let out a frustrated sigh. "The company hasn't picked up any new projects lately. How are we supposed to pay Arabella back?"


Khloe hesitated for a moment,then blurted out the truth about losing to A.S. The moment Elissa heard it, her expression shifted. "Are you serious? Why didn't you just say no?"



Khloe's shoulders slumped. "If I refused, my influencer career would be over. Everyone online would turn against me!"



Elissa's patience ran thin. "So you think your online popularity matters more than the company actually staying afloat?"



Khloe could only lower her head, unable to argue back. Elissa's voice grew firm. "You'll need to come up with the money on your own.Don't expect to use any of the family's funds."



Khloe opened her mouth to protest, but Meagan interjected, "You're nowhere near as sharp as Elissa. Right now, all you care about is
your own career? If the company collapses, the whole family loses everything."



Though Khloe felt wronged, she realized they were right.



But the thought of being mocked online for everyone to see was unbearable.



Frustration boiled inside her.



Meanwhile, in the Gracebourne villa, Arabella stepped out of her room at the same moment Asher exited the study.



She offered a gentle greeting. "Hi, Asher."



He looked at her with a soft reply. "Hey."



It surprised Arabella to catch a hint of irritation on his face. She wondered what could have put Asher in such a mood.



She asked, "Is something on your mind?"



He answered with a shrug, "A little."



Arabella hesitated, but spoke up. "If you want to talk about it, maybe I can help."



Before Asher could answer, his phone rang
Dominick's voice came through the line. "Mr.Gordon, Ms. Hudson insists you pick her up yourself. Should I go instead?"


The mention of Ms. Hudson immediately caught Arabella's attention.



There was only one Hudson family of real significance, and their status trailed just a bit behind the Gordon family.



Asher replied with icy calm, "That won't be necessary."



He ended the call without another word.



Arabela felt a bit uncomfortable after overhearing the conversation.



It seemed clear the Hudson girl was acting out,but Asher had no patience for it.



Arabella guessed his mood probably had something to do with relationship troubles. She decided not to say more and was about to leave,when Asher asked, "Are you busy the day after tomorrow?"



Arabella took a moment to think it over. The day after tomorrow was set aside for the
second-to-last move in her plan for revenge.



Even so, her schedule would be clear by the time evening rolled around.



"I don't think I have anything planned," she answered.



Asher met her eyes. "Would you come to a banquet with me? You won't have to do anything special-just enjoy the evening."



"If you need me there," Arabella responded,hesitating for a moment, "I'll come."



A flicker of a smile crossed Asher's face, his deep voice as calm as ever. "Great."



He looked at her, his expression much gentler than before. "Get some rest."



She nodded."Alright."



Arabella returned to her room.



The following morning, she got up early to get ready for dance practice.



Coming out of her room, she found Asher sitting on the sofa. He wore a vest and looked especially sharp and handsome as he read the
newspaper.Sunlight poured in through the tall windows,casting a golden glow over him. He looked every bit the classic gentleman, as if he belonged in an old movie.



Noticing her stare, Asher set the paper aside and said, "You're awake. Let's eat."



"Alright."



They sat facing each other over breakfast,quietly sharing the space. Arabella glanced at him now and then, a strange feeling curling in her chest, something she couldn't quite name.


Asher caught her eyes and asked, "What's on your mind?"



His tone was softer than usual, his expression calm and open.



Arabella gave a small smile and replied softly,"It's nothing. I just realized it's been ages since I've actually shared a meal with someone like this."



A wave of warmth washed over her, reminding her what it felt like to be part of a family.



She had lost her parents young and left home
early. Life had always been a steady grind of work and little else.



Asher could not guess her thoughts, but a gentle smile tugged at his lips and his voice came out low and steady. "You'll get used to this kind of life."



Arabella muttered to herself, "Will l?" The warmth from the milk left her feeling unexpectedly comforted.



Once breakfast ended, Asher drove her to the Griridge Opera House.



With the show coming up soon, rehearsals only became more demanding.



Lailah tried every trick to catch Arabella in a mistake,but Arabella's dancing was flawless. By the end of the day, Lailah was fuming, unable to find a single fault.



That Daisy.How infuriating!



Lailah could hardly contain her frustration.



She was not the only one watching Arabella's every move. Elissa had been paying close attention too.
As Arabella walked off the stage, she spotted Elissa waiting nearby.



Elissa's face looked sour. She had hoped Arabella would slip up on stage and lose her spot,but there were no mistakes to use against her.



"Arabella." Elissa took a deep breath. "You're not even a dance student. Stepping on stage will only embarrass yourself. Do you really want to drag Daisy's name down with you?"



Arabella arched her brow. "If you're not worried about making a fool of yourself with your dancing,why should I be?"



Elissa was so upset she nearly choked on her words. This infuriating girl!


She triedto compose herself, forcing her tone to be calm. "Let me take your place," Elissa suggested. "Name your price. I'll pay you."



Elissa was desperate for this performance to revive her own reputation.



Arabella's face stayed blank. "Maybe pay me back for everything you sold from my house first," she said, then walked right past.
Elissa spun around and called out, "Arabella! My grandmother raised your father for so many years. You can't just be this cold to us!"



Arabella paused mid-step.



Not this story again.



Elissa's lips curled into a sneer, her gaze full of pride. "The truth is, I only learned recently that your father was not even my grandmother's real son. Even so, she still took him in. If it weren't for my grandmother, your father would be nothing, and you wouldn't even exist!"
###Chapter 51 I'm Not Going Anywhere





In Elissa's mind, Arabella remained nothing more than an orphan. How dared she display such arrogance?


Deep resentment churned within Elissa's chest.She had exposed the truth, anticipating the moment when Arabella would crumble into helplessness, yet Arabella's pretty face remained unmoved, her gaze growing even icier as it settled on Elissa.


"Your parents have passed, Arabella. The responsibilities your father abandoned now fall to you," Elissa declared with cold satisfaction.


"How inconvenient for me," Arabella murmured,her voice carrying silk-wrapped steel.


Elissa's lips curved into a cruel smile. "You'd better consider this carefully. My grandmother raised your father. You cannot treat me with
such disrespect."


"And what of everything my father sacrificed for your grandmother? From what I remember, it was my father who elevated your family beyond their station. If gratitude is owed, it flows inthe opposite direction. Without him, your entire family would still be gutting fish at the market."Arabella's soft laughter delivered the humiliation like a blade wrapped in velvet.


Elissa's face burned crimson as buried memories clawed their way to the surface-helping her parents at the market after school,the perpetual stench of fish clinging to her clothes, the cruel laughter of her classmates echoing in her ears.


Her hands balled into fists, hatred blazing in her eyes as she watched Arabella's retreating figure, when suddenly someone's fingers brushed her shoulder.



Elissa spun around, her breath catching in surprise."Lailah?"
"I overheard your entire conversation, Elissa.My heart breaks for you. Your dancing surpasses Arabella's in every way. I cannot fathom why she received the selection instead of you."Lailah's voice dripped with manufactured sympathy for Elissa's plight.


Finally, someone understood her pain.


Elissa's expression softened as she regarded Lailah with newfound warmth. "True, but my hands are tied now."


Lailah leaned closer, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Our troupe has always prized character above all else. I can see through her facade, but the others remain blind.If only everyone could witness her true nature."


Elissa found herself nodding in complete agreement.


Lailah's hand squeezed Elissa's shoulder with calculated comfort. "I heard tomorrow brings your school's anniversary celebration. Quite the
gathering, limagine?"


Something dangerous flickered in Elissa's eyes.


Such a crowded, vibrant event would provide the perfect stage for exposure.


Arabella remained oblivious to their brewing conspiracy. She made her way to observe Karlie's practice session. With the performance approaching, the backup dancers had accepted their fate and begun coasting through rehearsals, but Karlie continued pushing herself relentlessly.


"What's the point of exhausting yourself like this? Our moment will never come," someone muttered with bitter resignation.


Karlie straightened her shoulders, determination radiating from her stance. "As long as I pour my heart into this work, I believe recognition will find me eventually."


"You're living in a fantasy. Without the right connections, getting chosen remains nearly
impossible." The dancer sighed heavily before abandoning the studio.


"Your improvement has been remarkable,"Arabella said as she stepped through the doorway.


Karlie's face lit up with genuine joy upon seeing Arabella. "You came! I didn't expect you tonight."


"Now, let me show you a few techniques that will make all the difference," Arabella replied,her voice carrying quiet authority.


With the studio empty except for them, Arabella began demonstrating intricate movements for Karlie's benefit.



After another grueling hour of practice,darkness had settled over the city when they finally departed the dance studio.


The streets stretched before them, nearly deserted in the late hour.
Karlie mounted her bicycle and pedaled toward home. Arabella was preparing to summon a taxi when she noticed a familiar Rolls-Royce parked in the distance.



Beneath the night sky, the luxury vehicle appeared both mysterious and elegant, like something from a dream.


As Arabella approached, the tinted window descended smoothly. In the dim interior lighting,Asher's striking features emerged from the shadows, his gaze finding hers as he spoke with quiet command."Get in."


Arabella slipped into the seat beside him,settling into the leather with practiced ease."Were you simply passing through this area tonight?"


"Something like that," he replied, his tone giving nothing away.


Arabella accepted his vague response and leaned back against the seat's embrace.
She had pushed herself hard during practice today, and sleep had eluded her last night.Dominick's expert driving created a gentle rhythm, and she soon found herself drifting off.


Asher was reviewing important documents when he felt an unexpected weight settling against his shoulder.


As he saw the exhaustion etched across her features, an unfamiliar ache twisted in his chest.


She was only nineteen years old.


At her age, she should be discovering joy in simple pleasures, not carrying such heavy burdens.



Asher had just closed his laptop when Arabella's head slipped lower, coming to rest against his lap. She seemed to find comfort in this position, stretching languidly before settling into an even deeper slumber.


Dominick had grown accustomed to witnessing such intimate moments by now.
"Mr. Gordon, forgive me for asking, but..."Dominick hesitated, then pressed forward with careful words. "If you truly harbor feelings for Miss Stanley, are you still planning to proceed with the engagement to Miss Hudson?"


Both the Gordons and the Hudsons possessed immense wealth, and both families dreamed of cementing their alliance through marriage.


Asher's expression hardened like winter stone."I'm only providing care for Arabella because of my father's wishes. Nothing more."


Dominick chose silence as his response.


He found such claims impossible to believe.


Asher's gaze drifted down to watch Arabella curl into herself, apparently feeling the evening's chill.


He slipped his jacket from his shoulders and draped it over her sleeping form. The black suit jacket engulfed her petite frame, making her appear even smaller and more vulnerable.
Dominick found Asher's earlier denial even more unconvincing now.


He wondered if Asher himself believed the lies he was telling.


Dominick's voice returned to its professional cadence. "Griridge University has extended an invitation for you to attend their anniversary celebration tomorrow."



Griridge University held significance beyond Asher's alma mater status-he had poured substantial investment into the institution over the years.


Asher considered this for a brief moment before responding. "I'll attend."


Dominick nearly rolled his eyes at the predictable response. The question had been merely a formality.


The car glided smoothly through the night toward home. Arabella remained lost in sleep,so Asher gathered her into his arms and carried
her inside.



He placed her gently on the bed and drew the covers up to her chin with careful precision.


Just as he turned to leave, Arabella's fingers suddenly closed around his hand. Her touch was warm and soft, yet possessed surprising strength. She pulled him downward, and he nearly tumbled onto the bed beside her.


She continued sleeping, her breath creating warm whispers against his cheek.


Asher found himself studying her exquisite features, his gaze traveling downward to her lips -bright red and impossibly soft in the dim light.


Suddenly, he became aware of his own heartbeat thundering in his ears.


"Dad... Mom..." Arabella whispered through her dreams.


The romantic spell shattered instantly. Asher's expression transformed, becoming cold and
controlled once more. He attempted to extract his hand from her grip, but she refused to release him.


"Please don't leave me." Arabella's voice carried a hoarse quality, threaded with the ghost of unshed tears.



Asher froze, her words stopping him completely.





After a long moment of internal struggle, he whispered into the darkness, "I'm not going anywhere."
###Chapter 52 What Makes Her So Special



Arabella's expression finally softened. Asher remained beside the bed until her fingers gradually released their grip on his, and only then did he rise quietly and slip away.








The next morning, Arabella awakened to find herself tucked beneath her own covers.Confusion flickered across her face. She distinctly remembered drifting off in the car,which meant Asher must have carried her inside.



Her usual vigilance had completely abandoned her-she hadn't stirred once while being lifted and brought upstairs.


A wave of self-reproach washed over her,though relief followed close behind. At least it had been Asher.


Following her morning routine,she checked on Daisy before heading downstairs for breakfast.

After their meal, Asher drove her toward
Griridge University. This time, however,he stepped out of the car and walked alongside her toward the entrance.



"I can manage on my own," Arabella said.



Asher's gaze remained steady. "I'm attending the anniversary celebration today."



Heat crept up Arabella's neck as she averted her eyes, suddenly fascinated by the sidewalk.



The anniversary celebration had transformed the campus into a bustling carnival. Students and returning alumni filled every pathway,their voices creating a symphony of excitement that even the typically reserved Arabella couldn't entirely resist.



She spotted a finance lecture on the schedule and decided to investigate.


When she settled into her seat, Joshua's familiar figure commanded the stage.


Arabella's brow furrowed while Joshua's face lit up with obvious delight. He sent her a conspiratorial wink that made the girls surrounding her gasp behind their hands.
"Did Mr. Willis just look at me?"



"Dream on-he was definitely looking my way!"



Arabella buried her face in her palms,mortified.



Following Joshua's presentation, another financial expert,Colton Russell, took the podium to discuss market volatility. Arabella, whose passion for finance burned brighter than most realized,absorbed every word.



When the session concluded, a pressing question lingered in her mind.



But Colton departed swiftly, and by the time Arabella navigated through the dispersing crowd,he had nearly reached the exclusive faculty lounge.



"Mr. Russell," she called out breathlessly.



Colton pivoted, his expression politely curious."Yes?"



"I wanted to ask you something," Arabella said,catching her breath. "The concept you discussed at the end-I believe there might be some flaws in the reasoning."
As Arabella articulated her concerns, Colton's polite attention transformed into genuine amazement. "What year are you in the finance program?"



Arabella shook her head. "Actually, I'm majoring in dance."



"Dance?" Colton blinked, certain he'd misheard."Please, come inside-I'd love to hear more about your perspective."



Inside the lounge, their conversation flowed with unexpected energy and depth.



"With such an impressive understanding of financial theory, why choose dance?" Colton asked,leaning forward with genuine curiosity.


Arabella pressed her lips together. "There are some personal circumstances involved..."



"I was just about to grab lunch. Would you care to join me?" Colton offered warmly.



Arabella considered for a moment,then nodded.Her afternoon stretched empty anyway.



The door swung open, and Colton's face brightened at the newcomer."Perfect timing-
how did your session go?"



"Well enough." Asher's eyes sharpened as they settled on Arabella. "And this is?"



	remarkably insightful student," Colton explained. "She challenged some complex financial concepts with real sophistication. I've invited her to lunch with us. I don't believe l caught your name?"



"My name is, well..." Arabella faltered.



Asher's voice cut through her hesitation. "We should head to lunch now."



Colton, easily distracted, let the matter drop and continued his animated discussion with Arabella as they walked.



They made their way to a private dining room on the cafeteria's top floor, though their passage still drew considerable attention.



"There's Mr. Russell. Who's that girl beside him?"Joyce observed sharply.



Kenny's expression darkened. "I think that's Daisy."



Joyce's face contorted with disbelief.
"Impossiblel What makes her so special?"



Elissa's features reflected a storm of conflicting emotions. "I'm afraid it really is her," she said slowly.



"That troublemaker! Now she's setting her sights on Mr. Russell! What a shameless opportunist!" Joyce hissed.



Around them, several other girls felt their hearts sink like stones.



"Is Daisy actually having lunch with Mr. Russell?"



"Maybe they're just discussing academics."



"What could a dance major possibly contribute to a conversation with Mr. Russell?" someone added with barely concealed jealousy.



Colton,with his striking features and reputation as a brilliant young entrepreneur, occupied the same pedestal as Joshua in many female students' fantasies. His lecture had drawn an audience heavy with admirers.



The sight of Arabella effortlessly capturing Colton's attention ignited a wildfire of envy



Kaitlyn caught a glimpse of Colton's retreating
figure,and her expression shifted dramatically Something troubled flickered across her features,leaving her visibly shaken.
###Chapter 53 Why Not Just Go For Asher


A soft sigh escaped Elissa before she leaned in and spoke. "You've always been in Daisy's corner, Kaitlyn. But honestly, don't you see her true colors by now? She's more skilled than you think at flirting with guys."



A faint bite to her lower lip was Kaitlyn's only sign of uncertainty as she answered, her tone frosty, "I don't buy it. Daisy isn't like that."



With a roll of her eyes, Joyce jumped in to back Elissa up. "You'll see soon enough. Just wait until she shows you who she really is."



Deep down, frustration simmered in Joyce-Elissa had lied to her before. Still, those tears and apologies had managed to sway her yet again.



Blame fell easily on Daisy, especially since she had actually tried making a move on her boyfriend.There was no way to deny it.



Instead of talking sense into Daisy, Arabella had chosen to pick a fight with her!
Given that kind of spiteful behavior, Elissa's dishonesty almost made sense.



"She's unbelievable," Joyce muttered through gritted teeth.



Elissa couldn't help but chuckle in response.



Curiosity got the better of Joyce. "Doesn't this make you mad,Elissa?"



With an air of calm, Elissa just shrugged. "No need to worry-what's right will win in the end."



Meanwhile, in a private dining room, Colton watched Arabella as if he had stumbled across a rare gem.


That didn't go unnoticed by Asher, whose mood darkening with every passing moment.



Breaking the silence, Colton addressed Arabella,offering, "You've really got a spark. Why not join my company? I'd make sure you have every opportunity you could want."



Her answer came with a polite smile. "That's very generous, Mr. Russell, but I'm not looking for a job at the moment."
Disappointment flickered in Colton's eyes. "With your drive, you could run your own company one day. And if you ever do, let me know. I'd love to invest."



The compliment left Arabella feeling just a bit uneasy.



If only he knew her own company was already thriving.


Switching gears, Asher placed some food onto Arabella's plate. "Let's just eat," he said quietly.


Joshua wandered over right then, plopping down next to Arabella with a grin. "Well, look who's here! You could've told me you'd be attending the lecture."



Arabella met his question with a shrug. "You didn't mention you'd be here either."



A grin spread across Joshua's face. "I happened to have some time, that's all. Do you want to order anything else?"



Colton's eyebrows shot up in surprise. "Do you know her, Mr. Willis?"



Pride was clear in Joshua's response. "Of course
I do."



With a knowing nod, Colton added, "I thought as much. Someone with her talent is bound to stand out."



He looked at Arabella. "Let's trade numbers."



A quick flick of her wrist brought out Arabella's phone,and they exchanged contact information without fuss.



Juggling conversation from Colton and Joshua left Arabella barely a moment to herself, as she bounced from one question to another.



Asher ate in silence, his expression brooding.Nobody paid his mood much attention, Colton,for one, was used to seeing himn that way.


Reaching for a way to smooth things over,Arabella suggested, "Would you like something to drink,Asher?"



The question caught Asher's attention, and whatever shadow he had been under seemed to lift. His answer came gently. "Coffee would be perfect."
She nodded and quickly bought him a cup of coffee.



Colton eyed his good friend with curiosity,wondering what had changed to lighten Asher's mood so suddenly.



On the other side of the table, Joshua quietly took in the exchange, noting just how different Asher was around Arabella.



When lunch wrapped up, Joshua and Arabella slipped away together.



A stroll around campus gave them a chance to unwind, and soon they found a bench to sit and talk. Joshua leaned back, breaking the comfortable silence. "You know, Mr. Gordon's support could mean big things for our company."



In a calm, even tone, Arabella replied, "His help is only because of a promise he made to his father."



Joshua pressed on, "If he's that willing to help you, maybe he'd support us as well."
She shot him a firm look. "Let's drop the subject. If there's ever a need for us to work together, we'll go through official channels.Don't chase after partnerships with Asher on your own."



Joshua's enthusiasm fizzled. "Got it, boss."



A few steps away, Asher and Colton had just arrived, pausing as they spotted Joshua and Arabella together. Colton muttered, "Didn't we just finish eating? What are we doing back out here? Wait-isn't that Mr. Willis with Arabella?"



They stood there, unsure if they should approach.



When he overheard Arabella and Joshua's exchange, Asher's expression softened, a warm light flickering in his eyes.



Colton could hardly believe what he was seeing.



The dynamic between Asher and Arabella was turning out to be something he hadn't expected at all. Hearing Joshua casually call her "boss"made everything suddenly click; no wonder she
had turned down his company offer.



"Hey, something just came to mind." From out of nowhere, Joshua perked up, an idea sparking in his eyes.



Arabella had a bad feeling about what he was going to say but gave him a nod to continue.



With a grin, Joshua suggested, "Why not just go for Asher? If you two were together, there wouldn't be any awkward boundaries left between you."



The minute those words left his mouth, he met a frosty glare from Arabella.



Still, Joshua continued, "I get that love isn't really your thing, but that's exactly why you and Asher would work. Neither of you wants romance, you both stand out from the crowd ... Sounds like a perfect match made in heaven,if you ask me."



The whole conversation struck Colton as completely absurd.



What was Joshua thinking? He was seriously
contemplating setting Asher and Arabella up?



He had to admit she was impressive, but Asher wasn't the type to bother with relationships. In fact,Asher never seemed interested in anyone,least of all women.



A joke started to form on Colton's tongue, but glancing over at Asher, he noticed something odd-those famously cool eyes had softened,and the tips of his ears were tinged with red.Asher looked lost in his own thoughts.



The sight left Colton reeling.



Was Asher actually considering what Joshua had just said?
###Chapter 54 You'll Regret Ever Crossing Me



Arabella's answer was immediate, her tone colder than ice. "Don't even think about it.Asher and I can never be together."


The second she finished her sentence, Colton left a palpable chill in the air,one that seemed to cling to Asher.



Colton had already been caught off guard several times today.



Seeing Arabella shut Asher down, Colton couldn't believe her boldness.



Without another word, Asher spun on his heel and strode off. Colton wasted no time, slipping away before he could get dragged into the awkward scene.



Curiosity flickered in Joshua's eyes, but Arabella offered him no explanation. "You have work to do. Go on," she told him firmly.



Joshua hesitated,then tried to lighten the mood "Fine, but if you start missing me, just give me
a call,okay?"



His reluctance was obvious as he turned to leave.



She didn't bother replying to his rambling.



Later that day, a major event was set to take place in the gym.



The idea of sitting through it held zero appeal for Arabella, and she was heading off campus when Elissa appeared in her path.



Hearing her name called, Arabella stopped. As Elissa drew near, a faint, sweet scent drifted between them. Arabella noticed it right away,thanks to her sharp senses.



She narrowed her eyes. "What do you want?"



In a gentle tone, Elissa made her case. "There's a show at the gym this afternoon. Would you watch it with me? I've been thinking about us since yesterday. My family was wrong before. I want to be like we were as kids-close, without all this distance."



"You act like a fox eyeing the henhouse,"Arabella replied, sarcasm dripping from her
words.



For a split second, Elissa's face twisted, but she quickly replaced it with a look of regret. "Say whatever you want. I'll accept it. I just want another chance for us to be friends again."



Arabella rolled her eyes, but before she could add anything else, a wave of dizziness washed over her. Her hand went to her forehead. When she noticed this, Elissa's eyes glinted. "Are you all right?" she asked, her voice honey-sweet.


"My head is spinning... Why do I feel so strange?"Arabella managed to mumble.



"That's odd," Elissa replied smoothly. "Let me help you sit down for a bit."



Dragging Arabella along, Elissa made a beeline for the gym.



Every attempt Arabella made to pull free failed -her strength just wasn't enough.



Once they arrived at the equipment room,Elissa's sweet smile faded. Ice replaced every trace of kindness in her eyes. With a sudden shove,she forced Arabella inside and slammed the door shut, locking it tight.
"No! Please, someone, help me! Let me out of here!" The voice drifted weakly from inside,its desperation muffled by the thick door that stood in the way.



A satisfied grin crept across Elissa's face.



She silently boasted, "Go ahead and challenge me, Arabella. You'll regret ever crossing me."



Excitement buzzed in the air as the performance drew near.



A famous guest had packed the house, and every seat pulsed with energy and expectation.



Joyce searched the room for Arabella but didn't spot her anywhere. That made her lips curl into a quiet, knowing smile.



A girl in the next row spun around to steal a look at her, whispering to a friend. The sight made her mood sour in an instant. She kicked the back of her chair. "If you've got something to say about me, let's hear it. Don't keep secrets."



Fear drained all color from the girl's face. She stared at Joyce as though she had seen something out of a nightmare.
Whispers of worry spread to the students nearby.



Watching everyone react like that only fueled Joyce's irritation.



Why did everyone insist on treating her like a villain?



The fact that Kenny was sitting next to her made the embarrassment sting even more.



"Well? Care to explain what you're talking about?" Frustration rising, Joyce kicked the girl's chair a second time.



Right then, the girl burst into tears.



Her friend had finally had enough. Embarrassed by the scene, especially with so many eyes on them, she snapped back, "You're seriously asking? Like you don't know? Haven't you made a habit of bullying people?"



Dirty looks were exchanged across the row as more students glanced over at Joyce.



Wasn't it just sad, someone her age still acting like a bully in college?
"She tried stealing my boyfriend, so of coursel stood up to her," Joyce snapped,not bothering to hide her annoyance.



A voice rang out from a few seats away-Kaitlyn challenged her. "Can you actually prove that? Remember how Elissaonce claimed Daisy was at her place, but it turned out Elissa had moved into Daisy's home instead?"



Every eye seemed to settle on Joyce, and her hands started to sweat. She raised her voice,desperate to convince everyone. "My boyfriend told me straight out. Isn't that proof enough?Kenny,back me up here!"



Attention landed squarely on Kenny, who looked uncomfortabole but nodded. "Yeah,that's what happened," he admitted, his tone resigned.



"I'm not buying any of this without real proof,"Kaitlyn said, dismissing the whole thing. "If someone wants to play the pawn, that's their own business, not mine."



Without waiting for a reply, she turned away and focused on the stage.
Most of the other students followed suit,returning to their own conversations and whispering behind their hands.



The girl Joyce had bullied kept crying, and her friend shot daggers at Joyce, eyes full of blame.


Defeat settled over Joyce like a heavy cloud.



Why couldn't they just see things from her side?One day,the truth would come out.



Moments before the show started, the staff hurried over to the equipment room, surprised to find the door locked tight.



"Who shut this door? Wasn't it supposed to stay open?" a staff member asked, puzzled.



Shrugs and head shakes circled the group."None of us locked it," someone replied.



Right then, faint noises seeped from inside-strange,distressed sounds that caught everyone off guard.



Muffled cries echoed behind the door, and realization spread silently across the group.Uneasy looks were exchanged as people understood what was going on.
###Chapter 55 Being Pretty Isn't A Crime



A surge of noise rippled through the audience seats as people caught wind of the chaos.


"Oh my goodness. That is absolutely wild! I find it hard to believe that anyone would actually have the nerve to mess around at school."



"You've got to be kidding me. This is disgusting!Hurry up, open that door-let's find out who's inside!"



Joyce's eyes gleamed.



She recalled Elissa's earlier promise to reveal Arabella's true nature for all to see.



Clearly,Elissa hadn't left anything to chance.


Outrage colored Joyce's voice as she made her way to the equipment room. "This is beyond inappropriate! Someone's behaving like this right in school?" she shouted for everyone to hear. "We need to get this door open and expose whoever's inside!"
Staff members, just as frustrated and unable to track down the key, joined Joyce's efforts.Several hands started pushing against the door,Joyce among them.



After a few tries, the lock finally started to loosen. One final push, and the door swung open,revealing the scene inside.



Tangled together and completely undressed,two people froze in shock as the door burst open.



"Ah!"



The unexpected entrance left the two of them staring in wide-eyed disbelief, their faces clearly showing just how rattled they were.



Neither face was familiar, except the girl, whose head was pressed into the man's chest.


"Daisy!" Joyce called out, her voice crackling with false outrage while her eyes sparkled with vindication. "Honestly, do you have any decency left? First, you tried to steal my boyfriend, and now you're turning the school's anniversary into a scandal!"



The outburst quickly drew a crowd.
"No way. That's really Daisy?"



"Sure, she's attractive, but who'd imagine she'd be shameless enough to hook up in the equipment room?"



"My eyes-why did I have to see that?"



"I used to feel sorry for Daisy when she got bullied,but now... maybe she deserved it. If this goes public, it'll drag our school through the mud."



For the girls, especially, whatever sympathy they had left for Daisy was wiped away by disgust.


Their own reputations felt at risk simply for being students here.



Stunned silence gripped most of the crowd, but Joyce wasn't finished. She squared her shoulders,her voice ringing out. "Daisy, you slut!You've just ruined the entire anniversary celebration!"



Intent on humiliating the girl inside, Joyce strode forward, ready to drag her out into the open for everyone to see.
"Were you searching for me?" A voice rang out behind her.



Joyce froze, as if struck by a jolt of electricity.Her head turned slowly, eyes wide, to find Arabella smiling in the middle of the crowd.



"Who knew you missed me so much, Joyce?"Arabella called out, her words dripping with amusement. "You really couldn't wait even a few minutes before you came looking."



A ripple of surprise swept through the students,quickly followed by a wave of guilt.


"It's not Daisy. Stop trying to blame her, Joyce."Kaitlyn's voice cut through the whispers.



Murmurs of agreement rose around them. "Yeah,that's enough. Why keep picking on Daisy?Being pretty isn't a crime."



"But if that's not Daisy, then who's in there?"someone wondered aloud.



Curiosity buzzed in the air.



The staff intervened, separating the tangled
pair. Within seconds, everyone caught sight of the girl's face.



"Wait-Elissa?" came a shocked gasp from the crowd.



Disbelief washed over Joyce as she stared at the scene, her confidence unraveling.


"This can't be right... Elissa?" she muttered,stumbling backward in shock.



Nearby, Kenny could hardly hide the mix of disbelief and pain flickering in his eyes.



Elissa's dazed expression changed as she realized all eyes were glued to her. Once awareness hit, she glanced down,saw her nakedness, and shrieked. Desperately, she grabbed for anything to cover herself before bolting behind the equipment.


"So Elissa was the one caught red-handed? No one saw that coming."



"For someone who always acted above it all,she sure isn't shy in private."
"Honestly, I never realized Elissa had such a body."





With opinions quickly shifting,even the few who had defended Elissa after her last scandal began to look away in disgust.



"That's revolting, Elissa! How could you sink so low?"



"Right-are you trying to destroy the dance department's reputation for good?"



Insults piled on. Embarrassment, anger, and dizziness nearly overwhelmed Elissa as she struggled to stay upright in the middle of itall.
###Chapter 56 Was This Your Trap From The Beginning


How could things unravel this way? Elissa was absolutely sure she shoved Arabella inside just moments ago.


The memory sharpened-she shoved Arabella in,but then the door swings open without warning.She barely has a second to react before someone shoved her through the doorway as well.



Waiting inside was a vagrant she arranged, and the room was laced with a powerful aphrodisiac she personally set out.



Elissa glances quickly at the vagrant, catching a look of utter confusion mirrored in his eyes.



So now she was the one who had been violated by this stranger.



The shock was overwhelming. Rage threatened to knock her off her feet, and tears spilled down her cheeks as she shouted, "You're wrong!That's not what happened! Daisy, you said you were exhausted and begged me to bring you
here. After I got you settled, everything went black. Was this your trap from the beginning?”



All eyes in the room shifted toward Arabella as Elissa's words hung in the air.



If Elissa was telling the truth, then Daisy's cunning knew no bounds.



This wasn't a minor scandal-someone's entire reputation was on the line.



Whispers of sympathy passed through the crowd, faces turning soft with pity.



Outraged, Joyce charged at Arabella, her hand lifted in accusation. "You bitch! I always knew you were behind this!"



Arabella barely smiled as she caught Joyce's wrist in midair.



A gentle twist was all it took. Joyce hit the floor,stunned and defeated.



A sharp cry escaped Joyce as pain shot through her, a fresh scrape blooming on her hand.



Kenny hurried to her side and gently lifted her up,his face twisting in shock. In a troubled voice,he asked, "You're all classmates, Daisy. Did you
really have to do that to Joyce?"


Arabella's reply was ice-cold. "What is your problem? She's the one who tried to slap me first."


Fury burned in Joyce's eyes. "I went for you because you set Elissa up. You're cruel-how could you drag her name through the dirt?"


Tears streamed down Elissa's face, each sob laced with despair. "Daisy, if you had something against me, you could've said it to my face. You didn't need to go this far. I'd rather not go on living!"



The outrage in Joyce's voice filled the room."Just look at what you're doing, Daisy! You're pushing her right to the edge!"



All around, students exchanged uneasy glances,a wave of sympathy rising for Elissa's plight.


Suddenly, the university president's voice cut through thetension. "What'sall this commotion?"



Colton and Asher appeared at his side, having followed the noise.



Asher's quick steps slowed only when he
spotted Arabella safe and sound, relief softening his features.


Joyce wasted no time, launching into her version of events for the president. "Sir, Daisy is the one behind this. She trapped Elissa,shattering her reputation. You can't just let Daisy walk away. She's beyond cruel!"



Elissa's sobs echoed from her hiding spot behind a row of equipment. "I can't take this,Daisy.You're so ruthless!"



With a stern look, the president swept his gaze over the group, then focused on the vagrant and said, "Tell me exactly what happened here."


The president's stern gaze had the vagrant shrinking back, words tumbling from his lips. "I heard about some sort of anniversary happening,so I wandered over. I stumbled on this equipment room and figured I'd catch my breath inside. That's when someone shoved this student in after me."



Arabella's lips curled in disdain. "Don't be absurd.This was all set up ahead of time. Besides, has anyone else noticed how warm it's getting in here?"
A few students glanced at each other. "It really is kind of hot!"



Someone else chimed in, "Wait, you think there's an aphrodisiac in the air?"



"Who'd go that far? That's crazy!"


Cheeks started to flush around the room as the warmth spread, a visible wave of discomfort taking hold.


A pitiful whimper escaped Elissa. "Daisy, how could you be so ruthless? You set me up!"


Not bothering to respond, Arabella crossed the floor,scooped up Elissa's discarded clothes, and fished a sachet out of one of the pockets. With a casual flick, she tossed it into the crowd.



A cooling scent drifted through the group, the sensation sharp and immediate.



"Did this just make the heat vanish? I actually feel'better after taking a breath," someone remarked.



"Same here! The heat is gone," someone added.


With a look that could freeze water, Arabella
addressed Elissa. "If the aphrodisiac came from me,explain why the antidote was hidden in your pocket."



Panic swept across Elissa's face. "I-I didn't put it there. You must have planted it!"



Arabella didn't miss a beat. "Let's get it checked for fingerprints, then. I bet yours are all over it."



The blood drained from Elissa's cheeks, leaving her white as a sheet.
###Chapter 57 Don't Mess Up My Hair



Elissa found herself speechless, not knowing how to respond.



How did Arabella know the sachet?



Even that short pause said enough, and the disappointment from the crowd was immediate and unmistakable.



"How disgusting! So Elissa was responsible all along!"



"But if Elissa had the sachet, why did she end up affected too?"



"Just think about it for a second. The homeless man was definitely drugged. The minute Elissa walked in, he probably stripped her, so she never got the chance to take out the sachet.Elissa only has herself to blame," Kaitlyn cut in,her tone cold as ice.



Most of the students found that explanation believable.
Arabella glanced over at Kaitlyn in surprise. She had been trying to figure out a way to explain things, but Kaitlyn had taken care of it already.



The president did not hesitate. "Everyone out!Elissa, get dressed," he instructed firmly."And someone bring that homeless man to my office!"


Staff members quickly led the homeless man away, shutting the door so Elissa could change in private.



Little by little, the onlookers left the room.


Joyce left,feeling completely lost and defeated.



She failed to notice that Kenny was equally in low spirits.



"I told you Daisy would never do something like that. I liked her from the start. She's had it so rough!"



"Who could have guessed Elissa would turn out to be so manipulative? She's downright mean!"



"Maybe Elissa will finally get expelled. Then we won't have to worry about her causing any more trouble."
"It's so funny that Joyce got fooled by Elissa."



People's harsh comments swirled around her,and gradually, Joyce snapped back to reality,unable to shake off the anger building inside.Without another word, she left the gym behind.



Arabella quietly exited the gym with Asher at her side.



Asher glanced over and asked, "What are you planning to do now?"



Arabella responded, "How does the school usually deal with this kind of thing?"


His answer came quickly. "A case like this leads straight to expulsion. The school also announces it to everyone."



Arabella gave a nod. "That's all I wanted to know."



A trace of worry flashed in Asher's eyes as he took a closer look at her. "Are you really alright?"



Arabella met his eyes and paused for a moment.She realized she had not felt anyone's genuine concern since her parents passed away. "I'm alright," she replied quietly.
Relief showed in his features. "Glad to hear it."



Without warning, Asher reached out and gently placed his large hand on top of he head.



Arabella stood there, startled, noticing how his palm nearly covered her whole head. Snapping back, she shook her head and said, "Don't mess up my hair."



The motion surprised Asher too, but when he noticed her ears turning pink, a smile started to form. "You know, I went to this school too.You've been so focused on avenge your sister that I bet you haven't had time to see the campus. How about I show you around a little?Afterward, we could head to the banquet together."



Arabella paused to think it over, then nodded."Alright."



Griridge University stretched out before them,with buses rolling along the main streets and rows of tall sycamores creating patches of shade. Even with the sun blazing, the coolness under the trees lingered.



Few people were out and about. Most had gJone
to catch performances or join in on campus activities.



Together, they wandered quietly. Arabella watched sunlight scatter through the leaves,casting moving patterns on the sidewalk. With every step, she felt a bit more at ease, surprised by the comfort it brought her.



Asher's skills as a tour guide left much to be desired. He pointed things out without flair."Those are the dorms. Over there's the library





Arabella admired the scenery as they made their way across campus. When they reached a grove of maples, she found herself drifting toward it, watching as the wind sent clusters of red leaves swirling through the air. The sight took her breath away.



"This place is beautiful." A soft smile appeared on her face, and her eyes seemed to brighten.



Asher watched her quietly, a gentle look in his own eyes.



She seemed almost childlike, taking in the world with new eyes and an open sense of wonder.
Asher pointed out the trees. "This is the maple grove. People say it's one of the most famous spots at Griridge University," he said, his voice calm and steady.



Arabella continued to smile. "I can see why. It really is gorgeous. I imagine everyone adores this place."



Asher shook his head. "It isn't just about the scenery."



Her curiosity was piqued. "Is there another reason?"



A barely-there smile touched Asher's lips, and the seriousness in his eyes softened. "Students say it's the best spot on campus for confessing feelings. Ninety-nine percent of the people who speak their hearts here end up with a yes."



"So that explains it." Arabella glanced around,clearly impressed. "No wonder. It's so peaceful here,anyone would feel comfortable."



Looking at Asher, she watched the maple leaves drift down around him. The gentle light softened his sharp features, and his tall figure stood out in the cascade of leaves.
Arabella tilted her head, asking, "Did you ever visit this place when you were a student?"



His eyes met hers. "This is actually my first time here."



That response caught Arabella off guard.



Asher leaned in, and Arabella caught a whiff of cedar. His cool fingers gently brushed her nose,and she instinctively stepped away.



Only then did she notice he was holding out a single maple leaf for her.


A warm flush colored Arabella's cheeks."Thank you for this."



He replied softly, "No need to thank me."



A gentle silence hung between them. Arabella watched more leaves twirl to the ground and finally said, "You must have been so popular at school. Did anyone ever confess their feelings to you?"
###Chapter 58 Is This Your Girlfriend



Asher spoke in his usual calm way. "I hardly ever showed up for school."


That did not surprise Arabella. Someone in his position, with all the privileges of a wealthy family,probably found regular classes far too simple.


A voice called out from nearby, "Hey,you two!"


Both Asher and Arabella turned around and saw a girl with a camera hanging around her neck.She looked like any other student wandering the campus.


The girl's cheeks glowed with excitement. "I was walking around taking pictures and just had to get one of you together. Honestly, you both look amazing-like a pair straight out of a magazine! Let me give you a copy."



She handed over the photograph.


Arabella accepted it. The picture showed her looking up at the fluttering maple leaves, while
Asher gazed at her. The whole scene looked soft and romantic.



A gentle warmth spread through Arabella's chest as she studied the photo.



Still bubbling with excitement, the girl asked,"You make such a striking pair. Which department do you belong to?"



"We're not..." Arabella tried to clear things up.But before she could finish, Asher interjected,"We only came for the event."


The girl grinned and nodded. "Got it! I'll let you enjoy your time, then. Have a wonderful day!"



When she had gone, Arabella traced her fingers over the photograph. "She definitely got the wrong idea about us."



Asher stayed unfazed. "It doesn't really matter.Is there somewhere else you'd like to see?"



Arabella glanced toward a building with a square shape, set apart from the rest. "What's that building over there?"



Asher replied, "That's the laboratory building."



As she heard this, Arabella's curiosity grew.
"Would it be alright if I looked around?"



Asher responded without hesitation, "Of course."



They headed toward the building, passing through strict security thanks to Asher. Once inside, Arabella watched robots move around the space, her eyes shining with excitement.She spent a few moments interacting with one of them, completely absorbed.



Their steps carried them deeper into the lab when, all at once, a door burst open and something shot out toward them. Arabella tensed, getting ready to dodge, but before she could move, Asher swept her into his arms,shielding her from danger.


It turned out that the object was only a malfunctioning robot, which jerked and wobbled right in front of them.


A young man in a lab coat rushed over. "Sorry!Oh no, I'm so sorry!" he exclaimed. This was River Lopez, a junior in Asher's old department.Though Asher had already graduated, River clearly remembered him."Are you alright?"


River's eyes widened when he saw Asher. "Wait,Asher? Is that you?"
Arabella suddenly realized she was still caught in Asher's embrace and quickly stepped away.Asher greeted River simply. "Hello."



River's expression changed from surprise to excitement. "Is this your girlfriend?" he asked,his eyes full of curiosity and a hint of mischief.



Arabella thought Asher would deny it,but instead, he turned the conversation. "What are you working on right now?"



River's enthusiasm faded as he explained, "I just finished building this robot, but now it's malfunctioning. I've checked everything, and l can't figure out what's wrong."



The faulty robot kept twitching and shifting where it stood.



Arabella moved closer to inspect the robot."Would you mind if I take a look at it?" she asked.



River hesitated. "Well... I guess, but..." He looked doubtful.



Asher chimed in, "Let her give it a shot."



Since Asher had spoken, River agreed and
invited Arabella to step into the lab for a closer look.



Arabella got right to work on the robot, and her expert handling left River completely astonished.



River could not hide his excitement. "Wow,your girlfriend is incredible!"


Asher's lips curled into the faintest of smiles,even though his voice remained steady. "She really is."



River watched her in admiration, then blurted out, "She looks pretty young though."



Asher answered without hesitation, "She's nineteen."



River stared at him, visibly taken aback.



Asher's girlfriend was so much younger than him.


A chill crept into Asher's eyes, his expression growing a little more serious. River immediately tried to smooth things over. "No offense meant!Honestly, you two make a great pair. A real dream team!"



Hearing this, Asher's expression eased a bit.
After about thirty minutes, Arabella finished her repairs and gave the robot an instruction. "Go shake hands with him."



The robot moved straight toward River, held out its hand, and showed no signs of its earlier problems.



River could only stare, amazed. He had not expected someone so young to know so much about artificial intelligence, but the proof was right in front of him.



He squatted down to look the robot over,finally spotting the error he had missed,and then glanced up at Arabella with new respect."You really are something else! When did you start seeing Asher?"



Arabella frowned, surprised by the label."What?"



River blinked. "Wait, aren't you together?"
###Chapter 59 Why Not Have Him Help You Decide


Asher kept his hands tucked in his pockets and looked as distant as ever. "Did I ever actually say that?"



River stood there, unable to come up with a response.



He could not help but wonder. Had he misunderstood? But if that was the case, why had Asher never set the record straight before?



With the atmosphere growing awkward,River scratched his head and hurried to switch topics."Sorry for the confusion. I just guessed. So, are you studying Al as well?"



Arabella gave a simple answer. "No."



Curiosity got the better of River. "Then which department are you with?"



A small smile played on Arabella's lips. "I'm in dance."



Surprise flashed across River's face.
He had never expected someone from the dance department to be so skilled.



The realization humbled him, even as a specialist in artificial intelligence.



For Asher, though, none of this was surprising.He had always known how remarkable Arabella was, and pride flickered in his eyes as he watched her.



A glance at the clock reminded Asher of their schedule. "It's getting late. Should we go so you can prepare?"


Arabella nodded. "Alright," she responded,remembering the banquet planned for that evening.


They walked off campus together.


Soon, Asher brought Arabella to an exclusive styling studio.


Stepping inside, Arabella was taken aback when she recognized the makeup artist. This was someone famous for working with celebrities and nearly impossible to book.


Only the best would do for Asher, and he
always made sure of it.



When the makeup artist laid eyes on Arabella,surprise filled her face.



The makeup artist chatted as she worked. "I've never seen anyone quite as beautiful as you. No wonder Mr. Gordon is so captivated."



Arabella was left at a loss for words.



It puzzled her why people always seemed to misunderstand her relationship with Asher whenever they appeared together in public.



She did not have the energy to clear things up anymore.



Asher looked just as weary of the constant confusion. After giving the makeup artist a few brief instructions, he turned to Arabella. "Stay here and let me know if you need anything."



Arabella nodded. "Alright," she replied, and Asher left the room.



Three hours slipped by while her makeup was completed. The staff then brought out several evening dresses for her to choose from.Arabella hesitated, uncertain of what to pick.
The makeup artist smiled warmly. "Mr. Gordon just finished getting ready too. Why not have him help you decide?"



That seemed fair to Arabella, especially since she would be attending the banquet with him."Okay," she remarked.



A staff member called for Asher, and before long, he walked back into the room.



His presence seemed to light up the entire space.Every eye turned toward him at once.



He was already striking in appearance, but the vintage black suit he wore made him even more magnetic. The tailored cut emphasized his broad shoulders and slender waist.



With his hair slicked back, his features appeared even sharper, and his deep-set eyes held no visible emotion.



There was an effortless elegance about him that could easily attract the attention of many young women.


The makeup artist clicked her tongue in appreciation. "The two of you together will draw every eye in the room."
Asher paid no attention to the remark and looked at the dresses instead. "Is there one you like?" he asked Arabella.



She studied the gowns for a moment, then pointed to an off-the-shoulder style. "How about this one?"



Asher gave a small nod. "Go ahead and try it on."



The staff led Arabella to the fitting room.



A short while later, she stepped out wearing the off-the-shoulder black gown. The sleek cut showed off her slim waist, and her bare shoulders looked soft and lovely.



Her graceful neck drew every eye, and the flawless makeup brought out her natural glow even more.



For a moment, Asher could not look away,completely entranced by how beautiful she appeared.



A quiet laugh came from the makeup artist."What do you think, Mr.Gordon?"



Asher snapped out of his trance. "She looks stunning."
Arabella agreed, smoothing out her skirt. Before she could do anything else, Asher gently placed a black shawl around her shoulders. "It's going to be cold with the air conditioning tonight."



She responded quietly, "Thank you."


The makeup artist let out a cheerful laugh.



So many little excuses.



No one would have guessed that someone as distant as Asher would ever show this much affection.



By six-thirty that evening, the pair had reached the hotel.



The entire floor had been reserved for the banquet.



That night's gathering centered around a major upcoming bidding event. It was one that could decide the future of an important project.


Guests filled the hall in their finest clothes,exchanging small talk while quietly sizing up one another.



Members of the Hyde, the Lambert, and the
Tucker families were all present.



Over time, the relationships among these families had only grown deeper, especially thanks to the bonds formed by their children.



Hayden leaned in and whispered, "I heard there's a special guest tonight."



Nathan Lambert, who was Joyce's father,answered with a hint of ambition, "It makes sense. An event this big is bound to draw their attention."



Secretly, Nathan hoped to use this chance to connect with the Gordon family.
###Chapter 60 I Believe You


Bennie was thinking along the same lines.



Hayden turned to Bennie and asked, "Are your kids here yet?"



Kenny and Joyce had already arrived and were mingling with some of the talented young guests.



Bennie had not been able to reach Elissa, and Khloe chose not to attend since her facial scars had not fully healed. He answered, "The kids are busy with a few things tonight."



Hayden gave him a playful nudge. "What could possibly be more important than this gathering?Both your daughters are pretty. Maybe Mr.Gordon will take an interest in one of them!"



That would be quite a fortunate turn of events.



Bennie laughed and replied, "You're joking, Mr.Hyde. There's no way Mr. Gordon would be interested in my girls. They might be bright,but in these circles, that is not always enough."
Even though Bennie dreamed of such possibilities, he knew his family did not hold much sway in high society.


Nathan stood by, keeping an eye on Joyce and Kenny from afar, and let out a quiet sigh.



He truly wanted Joyce to meet someone outstanding, especially now that the Hyde family was no longer as powerful and would soon need more support. He could not help but worry that they were not the best option.



While the conversation flowed, no one noticed that Asher had already entered the venue.



Rather than use the main entrance, he had chosen a private corridor that led straight to an exclusive suite on the third floor, where he could look down on the entire second-floor banquet hall.



Inside the private room, Asher found himself surrounded by familiar faces.


The moment he walked in with Arabella, every person in the room turned their heads in surprise.



Colton was especially shocked. "Wait,you two actually know each other?"
Arabella gave him a polite nod. "Good evening,Mr.Russell."



After greeting Colton, Arabella offered a polite nod to the rest of the group.



Her graceful presence and striking looks immediately won over the room, and several people gave Asher playful looks. "We always thought Asher just wasn't interested in dating.Turns out, his standards are just a littletoo high,"one of them said teasingly.



Asher's voice took on a firm edge. "Don't talk nonsense."



But wwhen he glanced at Arabella, a rare softness appeared in his eyes. "If you get bored,you can go downstairs and grab something to eat."



Arabella nodded in agreement. "Okay."


The conversation soon shifted to the upcoming bidding event.


Since everyone here came from influential families, they wanted to avoid letting the competition hurt their relationships. They needed to decide which projects each family
would take.



Arabella sat quietly for a while before deciding to excuse herself.



To her surprise, as soon as she left the room,she spotted Kenny making his way toward the terrace. She narrowed her eyes, curious about what business Kenny had stepping out in the middle of such an important evening.



She moved quietly, following at a distance.



The banquet was just getting underway, so the terrace was completely empty. Kenny checked to make sure no one was around before answering his phone. "I know, baby. I believe you. Try not to let it get to you."



Baby? That was definitely unexpected.


Joyce was inside attending the event, so whoever Kenny was calling had to be someone else.



Arabella watched him closely, her suspicion growing.



The real reason for Kenny's relationship with Joyce came down to the Lambert family's
###Chapter 60 I Believe You
support, especially since the Hyde family had been losing influence. Still, KKenny was clearly not satisfied. He had someone else on the side.



A distressed voice echoed through the phone,asking, "Why aren't you here with me? Why did you go to the banquet instead?"



Arabella's sharp hearing immediately picked up on who was speaking.



So it was Elissa on the other end of the call?



Arabella could hardly believe these two were secretly involved.



And what did that mean for Joyce?



A wave of sympathy for Joyce swept over Arabella. All this time, Joyce had been nothing more than a pawn for Elissa, never suspecting that Elissa was already involved with her own boyfriend.



If Joyce ever learned the truth, things would take a dramatic turn.



A faint smile played on Arabella's lips.



Kenny sounded completely at a loss. "Tonight's banquet could change everything for my
family's business. You know how important next month's bidding event is, right? My dad's depending on me to help secure a major project. Elissa, you know you're the only one 「care about. I'm only with Joyce because you asked me to be."



Arabella found the whole situation even more entertaining than she had expected.



So Kenny stayed with Joyce only because Elissa wanted it that way? He was willing to go that far just to please her?



Arabella could not help but admit that Elissa truly had a talent for keeping men under her control.



With her curiosity piqued, Arabella's eyes gleamed with anticipation. She was already thinking about stirring things up before finally revealing the truth behind the bullying at school.
enny spent a few minutes reassuring Elissa,t his phone buzzed with an urgent message om his father, so he had to end the call for OW.



/hen he returned to the banquet, Joyce was uick to approach him. "Kenny, where did you isappear to? You were gone for so long."



An old friend called me to talk about omething important. What's going on?" he answered casually.



Joyce's eyes lit up. "The Tucker family just came up with a brilliant idea!"



That caught Kenny's attention. "What sort of idea?" he asked, trailing after her toward the adults. Hayden and Nathan were already standing close, listening carefully as Bennie explained his latest project.



Hayden looked skeptical. "Is this project even possible? I can't see where the profit would come from."
Bennie leaned in and said in a low voice,"You'd be surprised. The quietest projects sometimes bring in the biggest returns. Think about it.Why would Mr. Willis be interested if there was nothing there? Do you really know what kind of person he is?"



At first, everyone doubted Joshua's abilities,but within a year, he proved his worth. Any project he touched seemed destined for success.



Vanguard Group was now leading the way,having risen to the top unexpectedly and setting the pace for all of Griridge.


Even with this information, Hayden and Nathan exchanged uncertain looks.



Suddenly, both received an alert at the same time.



Hayden glanced at his phone and saw a message from an unfamiliar number.



"People who bully others always face the consequences!"



Attached was a disturbing image showing evidence of how Kenny had spread lies about Daisy at school. The message ended with a
warning. "By the tenth of next month, Kenny must come here, confess, and publicly apologize for everything he's done!"



An address came after the message.



With every word he read, Hayden's expression grew even darker.



Nathan looked just as troubled. Compared to Kenny, Joyce's behavior was even more outrageous.



There was even security footage attached showing Joyce bullying Daisy.



The last sentence was clear and harsh. "By the tenth of next month,I expect Joyce to show up here and apologize in public, or the Lambert family will be finished in Griridge. I promise you'll pay the price."



Nathan's face turned red with anger.



He was not upset with Joyce for what she had done, but he could notstand being threatened.



Whoever sent this message had gone so far as to get his private number. That alone meant this was not just an idle threat.
Across the room, Bennie checked his own phone.





Shocking images appeared. Photos of Elissa,exposed in the equipment room at school, were followed by shots of her grinning while others tormented Daisy.



A new demand flashed on his screen. "If you want to protect your family, make sure Elissa comes here before the tenth of next month.She must apologize publicly and admit to everything she's done."



A cold shiver ran through Bennie.



He immediately knew Arabella was behind this.That woman had already taken that house and now she refused to give them a moment's peace!



None of the three could hide how shaken they felt.



Hayden forced himself to say composed as he glanced at Kenny. "I need to take care of something. I'll be heading out now," he said,
holding back his frustration as he left the banquet.



Nathan gave a short nod. "There are some things I need to handle as well. We can talk another time."



With that,he left, taking Joyce with him.


Bennie could not bring himself to remain at the event either.When he reached home, he found Elissa sobbing in Meagan's arms, while Khloe stood nearby looking deeply troubled.


Bennie stared in disbelief. "Tell me the truth.Did you really go to the equipment room today?"



Meagan jumped to Elissa's defense right away."She's already under so much stress. Why are you being so harsh? Are you trying to push her over the edge?"



His jaw clenched, Bennie simply handed them his phone so they could read the message.



Their faces turned even paler as they finished reading.
Khloe cried out in outrage, "It's Arabella! Tha awful woman-what does she want from us?"



Bennie let out a shaky breath. "If this comes tc light, Elissa, how will you ever face anyone again?"



Elissa had already suffered the humiliation of expulsion at school. She never imagined coming home only to be hit with such devastating news.Tears filled her eyes as dizziness set in,leaving her reeling at how her once easy life had spiraled into a nightmare.
###Chapter 62 Your Sister Is Awake



Elissa broke down, unable to stop her tears. Her hatred for Arabella had never been stronger.



Not once did she stop to think that she had been the one who bullied Daisy from the very start.



In Elissa's eyes, Arabella was merciless,someone who deserved nothing less than the worst.


Meagan,feeling pity for Elissa, shot a glare as cold as steel and said, "Maybe it's time Arabella wasn't around anymore."


Khloe and the others were startled at first, but the shock faded quickly. They realized that as long as Arabella was out there, their misery would never end.



Meagan pressed Bennie urgently. "Can't you think of something? You have so many connections. We could handle Arabella quietly.She's just an orphan-no one would even notice
Bennie nodded in agreement. "You're right. I'll take care of it."








Meanwhile, Arabella was completely unaware of the Tucker family's scheme. After sending a few messages and grabbing a quick bite, she made her way back to the private suite. Asher was already waiting by the door. "You're back.I tried calling you just now."



She replied, "I didn't see it. What's going on?"



Asher's voice grew serious. "Your sister is awake."



Arabella's eyes widened in shock. She turned to rush for the elevator, but Asher cauught her hand."I'll go with you."



She hesitated. "Don't you have things to do?"



He shook his head. "Nothing more important than this."



Asher led her into the elevator by her side.



Back in the private room, someone blurted out aloud, "What's gotten Asher so flustered? I've never seen him move so fast."
Colton paused and then answered, "Let's not get involved."



Something told him this had to do with Arabella.



Another person in the group asked, "By the way,has anyone seen Kaitlyn lately? I kind of miss her around here."



Colton's eyes went cold in an instant. "She's busy."


The other man just chuckled. "Don't be so strict.Who knows, maybe I'll marry her when she's older!"



For once, Colton's face showed a flash of anger. He lifted his glass and finished his drink in one quick motion.



The glass slipped from his grasp and smashed against the floor, making everyone jump.



Colton managed a tight smile. "Sorry about that."



He calmly wiped his hand, then added, "I have something to deal with. You all go on without me. I'll be stepping out."
Arabella hurried to Daisy's room, where Daisy sat on the bed,her gaze empty and lost.



"Daisy!" Arabella's voice broke as she rushed to hug her sister.



A spark of awareness lit up Daisy's face. "Bella?"



Arabella nodded, her eyes rimmed with tears as she gently let Daisy go. Seeing Daisy so out of it made her heart twist with pain. "I'm so sorry,Daisy.I should have come home sooner."


Daisy stared at her, struggling to believe it was real. "You're really back,Arabella?"


Arabella gave a small nod, her voice trembling.


"Yes, I've come back." Her tears poured freely as she looked at Daisy. "I'm so sorry for everything. You went through all that pain. This is all on me."



Daisy reached out and hugged her tightly "None of it was your fault, Bella. I'm just happy you're home.I kept worrying you'd never return.I promise I'll behave now-just please, don't leave me again."



Arabella's heart overflowed with emotion.
Arabella furrowed her brow. "When did I ever say I wasn't coming back?"



Tears streamed down Daisy's face, her eyes red and puffy. "Aunt Meagan told me you left because I wasn't good enough."



A rush of anger and sadness washed over Arabella. How could Meagan say something so cruel to her sister? No wonder Daisy always kept her struggles to herself and only shared the good moments with Arabella through the years.



She softened her voice. "That's not true at all.I just had some important things to take care of.Now that everything is settled, I can stay right here with you."



Daisy's face looked even thinner than before,her eyes wide and watery as she gazed up. "Are you sure? You really mean you'll stay with me now?"



Arabella ran her fingers gently through Daisy's hair. "Absolutely. I'll be right by your side,always."



Relief washed over Daisy, and she buried her
face in Arabella's shoulder. "I missed you so much!"



A warm smile touched Arabella's lips. "I missed you too,Daisy."



From the doorway, Asher quietly watched the reunion before softly shutting the door behind him.



He made his way downstairs and asked the cook to prepare something.


Back in the room, a little while later, Arabella encouraged Daisy to try getting up for a bit.


Daisy hesitated, clearly uneasy about her injured leg.



Her voice barely above a whisper, Daisy said,"I don't really want to leave the bed right now."



Arabella could tell what Daisy was feeling. They were twins, after all. "Just try standing for a moment."



She gently helped Daisy sit up and swing her legs over the side of the bed. Daisy bit her lip as she stood, half expecting to fall, but both legs held steady beneath her.
###Chapter 63 I'll Protect You As Well!



Feeling slowly returned to the leg that had once been numb and useless.



Surprise flickered across Daisy's face.



With a gentle smile, Arabella spoke softly. "I took care of you every day while you slept.I applied ointment and used special treatments.By now, your leg should be almost as good as new."



"Is that true?" Daisy tested her leg, taking a few careful steps before bouncing lightly.



To her amazement, her leg worked perfectly again.



A surge of happiness swept through Daisy.Passing by the mirror, she stopped to touch her cheek.



The reflection staring back at her was clear and soft. Could this really be her? Was her face fully healed as well?
Tears shimmered in Daisy's eyes. "It was you who saved me,Bella."



"You'll be healthy from now on," Arabella responded,her words filled with reassurance.



Unable to hold back, Daisy threw her arms around Arabella and held her tight. "I'm so grateful to have you in my life!"



A soft laugh escaped Arabella. "Those people who hurt you are going to pay for it. I've already taken back the family property Aunt Meagan tried to steal. Everything they did-I'll make sure they regret it."



Daisy could only stare at Arabella in shock.



Confusion touched Arabella's face. "What is it,Daisy?"



"You're incredible." Daisy lowered her arms,sadness clouding her eyes for a moment. "You must have suffered so much to become so strong. I haven't helped at all. I just made things harder for you..."



A rush of emotion washed over Arabella.



Everyone else saw only her strength and skills.
Daisy, though, always cared about how she was really holding up.



"I've managed just fine," Arabella said gently,brushing a hand over Daisy's cheek. "I'm your big sister. It's my job to be strong and look after you."



A spark of determination appeared on Daisy's face. "It's not fair if you're the only one looking out for me just because you're my sister.I want to be strong too. From now on, I'll protect you as well!"



Hearing those words, Arabella felt warmth blossom in her heart. "All right, all right. So much has happened while you were sleeping.Come sit with me, and I'll fill you in."



They settled together on the couch, and Arabella began to recount how she had gone to the school and stood up for Daisy.


Daisy listened in awe, her eyes wide as she watched clips of Joyce and the others getting their comeuppance, and glanced through screenshots showing Elissa being insulted online.The expression on Daisy's face changed with each revelation.
"You're amazing, Bella," Daisy said with admiration shining in her eyes.


Arabella reached out and gently smoothed Daisy's hair. "Once they've been properly punished, you'll be able to return to school.How does that sound?"



Daisy gave a resolute nod. "I'd like that."



"There's someone else I'd like you to meet,"Arabella added.



She had barely wrapped up when her phone lit up with a message from Asher. "If the conversation's over, come down. Dinner's ready."


Arabella smiled and took Daisy's hand. "Come on. I'll keep telling you everything on the way.Asher has really helped us a lot while you were recovering."



Downstairs, the dining table was covered with a spread of tempting dishes. Everything was light and easy on the stomach for someone just waking up.



Asher sat at one end of the table, composed and dignified like an old-fashioned gentleman.
Leading Daisy over, Arabella offered an introduction. "This is Asher Gordon, the person I was telling you about."


With caution in her eyes, Daisy studied Asher.



Asher held her gaze and spoke in a steady voice."Hello, Daisy. Make yourself comfortable here."


Daisy pressed her lips together, giving a small nod.



Taking her seat beside Daisy, Arabella glanced at the spread on the table. "You really went out of your way for us."



Asher replied, "Daisy just woke up, so I made sure all this food would be gentle on her stomach."



A smile spread across Arabella's face as she nodded and helped Daisy to a serving.



Daisy began eating in silence.


Arabella asked, "Does the sachet I gave you last time still work?"



Daisy shook her head. "It doesn't smell as nice anymore."
Reaching into her pocket, Arabella pulled out a fresh sachet. "Here's a new one I made. This should be even better than before."


Asher reached for the sachet, and for a second,his fingers brushed against hers, sending a gentle warmth between them. He brought it closer for a sniff, pleased with the scent."Thanks."



Arabella responded, "No problem. By the way,is there any shape you like best?"


He looked thoughtful. "Shape?"


Arabella explained, "Or maybe an animal? I'm almost done with the thing I promised to make you."



A faint smile touched Asher's lips. "A cat would be nice."



Arabella felt a flicker of surprise. She had never pictured Asher as someone who liked cats, but she nodded in agreement and let it go without more questions.



Meanwhile, Daisy watched them closely, her eyes filled with a mix of curiosity and something bardor to nin dowi
After they finished eating, Arabella took Daisy outside for a stroll.





As they walked, Daisy held tightly to Arabella's hands. "Do you think we could move out and get a place of our own?"
###Chapter 64 Do You Have A Strategy,Elissa



"Why?" Confusion was visible in Arabella's voice.



"Living in someone else's house feels strange,"Daisy murmured, her lips forming a tight line. "I can't shake this feeling that we're intruding."



"I understand your concern," Arabella said,reaching out to ruffle her sister's hair with tender fingers. "But Asher isn't just anyone to us.You're completely safe here, and nothing unexpected will happen."


Daisy caught her lower lip between her teeth,her thoughts swirling behind unreadable eyes.



"Perhaps once we resolve everything with Joyce and her friends, we can find our own place," Arabella suggested, her tone hopeful."By then, I'll have enough energy to search for somewhere perfect for us."


Daisy's head bobbed in agreement. "Alright, I trust your judgment completely."



Their corner of the world radiated warmth and
peaceful comfort.


Meanwhile, tension crackled through the air at Joyce's home like electricity before a storm.


Nathan gripped photographs between his fingers, his knuckles white as he confronted his daughter. "Is this how you've been spending your time at school?"



Joyce's heart hammered against her ribs. She wondered how these images had found their way to her father's phone. "Dad, who sent these to you?"



"The message came from this number."Nathan's voice barely contained his simmering rage. "I investigated, but it traces back to a foreign number-completely untraceable. Who have you managed to anger?"


"L... I know exactly who did this! It's Arabella Stanley! She's that girl's sister!" Joyce's words tumbled out as realization struck her like lightning. "Arabella had the audacity to send you threatening messages! Dad, don't worry-I'll handle her myself."



"I suspect she's far more complicated than you realize," Nathan said, his voice dropping to an
icy whisper. "Did Kenny and Elissa also target her?"



"How did you discover that?" Joyce asked,surprise coloring her features.


"Mr. Hyde and Mr. Tucker looked deeply troubled. I could sense something significant had occurred," Nathan replied, his mind already working through the implications.



The Lamberts had always stood as the most prosperous among the three families. Nathan's thoughts raced with calculated precision. "For her to obtain all three of our private numbers,she must have prepared extensively."


Joyce began to grasp that this situation ran much deeper than her initial assumptions.


"Tell mne, did anything unusual happen the day your mom suffered her accident?" Nathan pressed.


Joyce's memory flickered back to that moment."We had cornered Arabella when suddenly a group of men in black suits burst through the doors..."



"It appears she has powerful allies watching her
back," Nathan said, his gaze growing darker with each passing second.



Joyce worried her lip between her teeth. "Dad,maybe it was just coincidence? Elissa mentioned that Arabella ran away from home when she was twelve. What could someone like her possibly accomplish? She probably either worked grueling jobs or became someone's kept woman."



"Your thinking lacks any depth!" Nathan's voice cracked like a whip. "Our family has enjoyed peace for years, but after you brought Arabella home,your mom fell into a coma. Do you still believe in coincidences? I conduct business with extreme caution-| would never cross any powerful family. The only logical explanation is that those men in black came specifically to protect Arabella!"



Joyce's face drained of all color.



Could this really be the truth?



"You need to find Arabella and resolve this mess immediately!" Nathan's words carried the weight of an ultimatum before he stormed from the living room.
Joyce remained frozen on the couch,her mind reeling, before she frantically called Elissa and Kenny to share what had transpired.



Kenny finally learned that Daisy possessed a twin sister-Arabella.



No wonder he had always sensed that Daisy seemed different after returning home. It hadn't been her at all!



"My dad received a message from Arabella too.I just endured a brutal lecture. Elissa, who exactly stands behind Arabella?" Kenny said,bewilderment evident in his voice.



Elissa's tone carried false confidence. "Who could she possibly have? She probably just paid some hacker to dig up our fathers' phone numbers. Don't worry-she can't maintain this charade much longer!"


"Do you have a strategy, Elissa?" Joyce asked urgently.


Even though Elissa had humiliated herself in the school's equipment room, making Joyce feel annoyed with her, their primary concern remained focused on Arabella.
"Don't worry, Joyce. I refuse to let you become collateral damage in this situation," Elissa declared, her voice blending determination with calculated gentleness. "I feel terrible that my actions got you scolded at school. This time,I'll confront Arabella directly."



Kenny's voice carried reassurance as he added,"Don't worry, Elissa. Joyce isn't someone who forgets loyalty easily. You two have shared years of friendship, and I've witnessed firsthand how devoted you've been to her. There's absolutely no way Joyce would harbor resentment against you."


Joyce felt her emotions churning like turbulent waters, caught between uncomfortable awareness and genuine gratitude as she reflected on Elissa's countless acts of kindness over the years.



Uncertainty clouded her thoughts like morning fog.



Should she really continue this friendship with Elissa?



The three friends reached an agreement that Elissa would handle the Arabella situation alone.
After they ended their call, Elissa sent Joyce a carefully crafted message. "I bought you something special. It should arrive soon. I hope you're not angry with me anymore. Even if our friendship doesn't survive this, I just want you to find happiness."



Within minutes of Joyce reading the message,a servant appeared at her door carrying an elegant package. "Joyce, your delivery has arrived."



Joyce accepted the box with trembling fingers,opened it, and gasped at the sight of the limited -edition handbag she had coveted for months.



The price tag read three hundred thousand dollars.



Astonishment washed over Joyce, followed immediately by a crushing wave of guilt.



Even though Elissa had consistently targeted Daisy with her cruel behavior, she had always treated her with unwavering generosity and care.



Besides, Elissa had every reason for her dislike of Daisy.



Allowing this conflict to destroy her friendship
with Elissa felt fundamentally wrong,almost like betraying someone who had stood by her through everything.



Joyce's fingers flew across her phone screen as she typed her response. "We'll remain friends for life. Don't ever say things like that again. If you ever need my help with anything, just tell me."



Elissa read the message, but instead of feeling any warmth, her lips curved into a satisfied smirk as she mentally labeled Joyce a complete fool. Manipulating someone as naive as Joyce proved almost embarrassingly simple.



In the days that followed, the weather grew increasingly oppressive with summer heat.



Arabella spent time practicing dance and enjoying quiet moments with Daisy at home.



On Friday, the sweltering atmosphere suddenly shifted ominously. After practice ended, thick clouds gathered overhead like gathering storm clouds, and rain began hammering the earth as Arabella raised her hand to hail a taxi home. 


Once she settled into the vehicle's interior,Arabella felt the air conditioning provide blessed
relief from the heat. "Please take me to Gracebourne," she instructed the driver.



"Certainly, miss," the driver replied, pulling away from the curb.



Arabella gazed out the window, watching the rain intensify into a torrential downpour.Lightning carved jagged white scars across the darkening sky. Exhaustion from her long day settled into her bones, and she allowed her head to fall back against the seat as her eyelids grew heavy.



The driver's eyes kept drifting to the rearview mirror as he studied her reflection with unsettling intensity.



The car continued its journey along increasingly deserted roads, the familiar cityscape giving way to isolated stretches of countryside.



After what felt like an eternity, the vehicle lurched to an abrupt stop.



The driver stepped out into the pounding rain,yanked open Arabella's door, and suddenly clamped a chloroform-soaked cloth over her mouth and nose while dragging her from the car with brutal efficiency. In that terrifying
moment, Arabella's consciousness snapped back to full alertness, and she began fighting with desperate strength against her ccaptor's iron grip.
###Chapter 65 What Have You Done To Me



The driver sneered, his voice cutting through the darkness, "Stop struggling. We're deep in the wilderness now. No one's coming to save you."



His hands moved with practiced efficiency as he bound Arabella with rope, then hoisted her toward the riverbank. Rain hammered down around them, turning the rushing water into a roaring torrent that disappeared into the black void below.



"This ends here," the driver declared, preparing to hurl Arabella toward the churning river.



But she never left his arms.



A dagger had found its mark in his abdomen.



He doubled over, pain shooting through his body as rage blazed in his eyes. Arabella sliced through her bindings with swift, precise movements and broke free from his weakening grip.
The driver lunged forward, desperate to reclaim his prize, but his body refused to obey.



"Don't waste your energy. That's a specialized paralysis technique. You'll stay frozen until I decide otherwise." Arabella's voice carried the chill of winter frost.



The driver's eyes widened as understanding dawned. "You... you were pretending the whole time?"



"How else could I uncover your true motives?Someone wants me dead, right?" Arabella's lips curved into a cold smile. "Let me take a wild guess about your employer. The Hydes? No,too obvious. The Lamberts? They lack the spine. It has to be the Tuckers."



Terror flickered across the driver's face.



His employer had described a nineteen-year-old girl. Nobody had mentioned she was anything more than an ordinary target.



"Talk. How much did the Tuckers offer you?"Arabella pressed.



"Well..." the driver stammered. In the next heartbeat, he clenched his fists, channeling his
remaining strength, and shattered the paralysis.His hand shot toward Arabella like a striking snake. "Enough to make this worthwhile!"


His movements blurred through the air,almost too fast to follow.



Arabella's eyes sharpened as she twisted away,and the two combatants clashed in the driving rain.



"You're from the assassin rankings, aren't you?"Arabella observed, her voice steady despite the chaos around them.



"Clever girl!" The man's surprise was genuine."So you know about the rankings. At least this won't be a complete waste of my time."



The assassin moved with devastating speed,each strike generating gusts of wind. One solid hit would prove fatal.


Arabella possessed remarkable skill, but her endurance couldn't match the assassin's relentless assault, and she found herself gradually retreating. Without warning,the assassin produced a dagger, its blade gleaming wickedly in the darkness. "I planned to drown you,but since you insist on being difficult,I'll
end this now."


He thrust the weapon toward Arabella's left shoulder.She reacted instinctively, dodging the obvious attack, but the assassin's eyes gleamed with satisfaction as his true target-a second dagger already positioned-pierced her right shoulder.


Professional killers never carried just one weapon.


Blood flowed from Arabella's wounded shoulder. She bit back a cry of pain. The assassin's grin widened. "I warned you that you couldn't win. You might as well beg for your life."


"Is that what you think?" Arabella replied, her voice unnaturally calm.



Suddenly, the assassin felt ice flood his veins.He looked down to find a delicate needle protruding from his chest. Its tip gleamed black with poison.



The assassin crumpled to the muddy ground,agony consuming his body. He screamed into the storm, "What... what have you done to me?"


Arabella gazed down at his writhing form.
"That's a lethal toxin. Once it enters your bloodstream, it tears your heart apart from the inside-until the pain kills you."


"You... you deceived me!" the assassin gasped,blood trickling from his mouth.



"Your technique was impressive," Arabella said with detached indifference, "but you made one fatal mistake. You underestimated your opponent."



She knelt beside him, searched his pockets for his phone, and used his fingerprint to unlock the device before sending a message to someone in his contacts.



After wiping the phone clean, Arabella turned and disappeared into the rain.



At the Gracebourne estate, Asher returned to find Arabella still absent. He had barely settled onto the couch when his phone rang with a call from Colton."The tenth-rankedassassinisdead!"Colton said.



"Are you certain?" Something about the lightning splitting the sky outside filled Asher with inexplicable dread.
"Unbelievable! Number ten, eliminated just like that. Who could have taken him down? The underworld grows more dangerous every day,"Colton mused aloud.



Asher shared his astonishment. Then he spotted a figure approaching through the downpour-a tall, slender silhouette moving through the rain.



He immediately ended the call and rushed to the entrance.






"Arabella!" Asher's voice rang out as he saw her,soaked to the bone with blood staining her shoulder.His expression darkened as he swept her into his arms and carried her inside.
###Chapter 66 Am I Going To End Up Crippled


Arabella gave him a gentle look. "You don't have to worry. I'm really all right."


Asher's eyes swept over her, taking in the sight of her drenched hair, soaked clothes sticking to her skin, and the blood spreading across her shoulder. As he saw that she pretended nothing was wrong despite her serious injury, a wave of frustration rose in him.



He spoke in a clipped voice. "Go get cleaned up first."



Not wanting Daisy to see her in that condition,Arabella slipped off to the bathroom downstairs to take a shower.


While she washed, Asher knocked on the door."I left your clothes outside."



Once she finished, Arabella opened the door and spotted afull set of fresh clothes waiting,even down to new undergarments, which brought color to her cheeks.
Trying them on, she realized everything fit perfectly, though the soft pastel shades felt a little too sweet for her taste.



A voice reached her from just beyond the door."Are you finished?"



She replied, "Yes, I'm all done."


Asher entered, carrying a first aid kit in one hand.
"Go ahead and slip your arm out of the sleeve."



Following his instructions, Arabella eased her arm free.



Asher got to work, cleaning the wound with alcohol,every movement smooth and confident.



The whole time, his face stayed grim, and it was clear he was far from happy.



Arabella felt uneasy in the silence and tried to lighten the mood. "How'd you get so good at this kind of thing?"



With a clipped tone and no hesitation, Asher said, "I served in the military."



A thick silence settled between them.
Noticing how upset he seemed, Arabella let out a quiet sigh. "It really wasn't a big deal. I've taken care of it."



Asher's response was sharp, his eyes blazing."You call ths wound a minor problem?"



Arabella decided not to say anything that might upset him. She let Asher bandage her in silence.



His expression stayed serious, but every touch was careful and gentle. Watching him work,she couldn't help but smile just a little.



Asher caught her look and frowned. "Do you find this amusing?"


She shook her head and let out a soft cough."No, that's not it. It's just-no one's looked after me like this in ages."


He stayed silent for a moment, then finally spoke, his voice sharp and distant. "People won't care if you keep acting like you don't need anyone. Stop carrying the weight alone."


A faint shrug escaped Arabella. "I understand.Honestly, it's not a big deal."


Asher didn't bother arguing. He finished
wrapping her wound and left the room. After a few minutes, he returned with a steaming cup of lemon water. "You're soaked through.Drink this or you'll get sick."


Arabella noticed the way he watched her, so she finished the whole cup at once. "See? All done."



Asher glanced her way, then turned to go."Try to get some rest," he said.



Even as he left, Asher's posture stayed composed and dignified. Still, Arabella felt a pang of worry. Was he upset with her? And if so,why would he be?



Pushing the thought aside, she went back to her room to rest.



After all, tomorrow was bound to be eventful.



By early morning, Arabella was up and ready.Heading downstairs, she spotted Daisy in the courtyard, practicing dance moves,while Asher sat in the living room, reading the newspaper.



"Good morning, Asher," Arabella called out.



Asher looked her way for a moment and said in a flat tone, "Morning." Then he returned to
reading his newspaper.



Arabella sensed the distance in his voice and felt a little uneasy.


As breakfast was set out, Arabella made her way to find Daisy.


"Do you have any plans for today?" Arabella asked.



Daisy replied in a cheerful tone, "Not really.I was just going to practice a bit. What's up?"


Arabella's lips curled into a sly grin. "Come with me. There's something I want to show you.l think you'll find it interesting."


Without hesitation, Daisy nodded. "That sounds great!"



A smile lingered on Arabella's face as she glanced at Asher, who ate in composed silence,every movement naturally refined. After a brief pause, she asked, "Are you busy today, Asher?"



He didn't look up as he answered, "Yes, I am."


With that, Asher finished his breakfast and left the room.
Daisy's brow furrowed. She leaned closer and whispered, "Do you think Mr. Gordon finds us troublesome? I mean, this is still his home.Maybe we should move out soon."



Arabella found herself wondering the same thing. She could sense the chill in Asher's behavior and felt uncertain.



"We can talk about it later. For now, let's get ready to leave after we eat," Arabella said.



When breakfast ended, Arabella took Daisy with her to the hospital. They put on their masks and headed toward a patient's room, where loud crying and shouts echoed from inside.


"It's so painful... Am I going to end up crippled?"Elissa cried out from within.



Meagan's concern was clear as she spoke up."What happened to you, Elissa?"



Frustration and bitterness showed on Elissa's face. "Someone sent me a message yesterday and asked to meet. But on the way there,I was attacked. They stole everything and beat me up!"



Meagan asked, "Did they catch anyone?"
Shaking her head, Elissa replied, "No. There aren't any security cameras in that area."



Khloe broke the silence. "That guy hasn't reached out again. Doesn't that mean he finished the job?"



Hearing this brought Elissa some relief. "Most likely.We did pay for the best assassin around.That little brat won't be a problem for us anymore!"



A cold glint appeared in Khloe's eyes as she grinned. "It was expensive, but it was worth every cent."


A faint smile touched Elissa's lips, though she kept glancing down at her hurt leg. "I agree,"she said, even if her worry was clear.



Khloe leaned in, hoping to reassure her. "Don't worry, Elissa. You're in the top hospital in all of Griridge. You'll recover in no time."



Elissa tried to believe it, but her mood was still bleak. "I hope you're right."



Daisy listened to their conversation with a faint frown. Arabella glanced at her, unsure if Daisy realized they were talking about her. Just then,
the elevator doors opened, and Arabella quickly pulled Daisy behind a pillar to hide.



Not long after Kenny stepped inside the room,Meagan and Khloe walked out.


When she saw Kenny walk in, a spark of resentment flared in Daisy's eyes. She whispered, "So Kenny's here? He and Elissa must be pretty close."


Arabella retorted, "It's more than that."


Inside, Elissa looked pale as a sheet. Her eyes were hard and bitter, but the moment Kenny appeared, she softened her expression and tried to look helpless and frightened."Kenny!"


Worry etched across his face, Kenny hurried over. "What happened to you, Elissa?"


Elissa's voice trembled as she wiped her tears and clung to his hands. "It was a trap. I'm terrified,Kenny."
###Chapter 67 The Real Show Is About To Begin



Kenny offered reassurance. "Don't be scared."


Instinctively, he wanted to hold Elissa close,but an image from the school's equipment room flashed through his mnind-Elissa with the vagrant. Nausea churned in his stomach and he edged away.



Elissa's eyes filled with tears as she stared at him,confused."Kenny,what's the matter?"



Kenny struggled to find the right words,forcing a small smile. "It's nothing, really."


Her heart grew coldat the look on Kenny's face."Do you find me disgusting now?"



Kenny used to gaze at her like she was the only person in the world.



Now,he would not even try to hug her.



For Elissa, that change stung deeply.



She had always thought of Kenny as someone
to string along, but losing his interest was a completely different story.



Tears spilled down her cheeks as she shoved him away. "Just leave. I get it. Even if none of this was my fault, people will always blame me. You should go to Joyce instead. She's a better match for you."



Seeing that disappointment in her eyes, Kenny felt something twist inside his chest.



He had been completely taken with Elissa the moment he met her.



Joyce came from a respectable family, but she didn't have Elissa's looks, and in bed, it was Elissa who pushed him over the edge.



As Elissa kept crying, her shirt slipping from her shoulder, Kenny felt a rush of desire he could not fight.


"That's not true. You know you're the one l want!" Kenny stepped forward and wrapped her in his arms. The way her body pressed against him sent his heart racing. He touched her cheek,drew her close, and kissed her.


Elissa teased him at first, her touch just out of
to string along, but losing his interest was a completely different story.



Tears spilled down her cheeks as she shoved him away. "Just leave. I get it. Even if none of this was my fault,people will always blame me. You should go to Joyce instead. She's a better match for you."



Seeing that disappointment in her eyes, Kenny felt something twist inside his chest.


He had been completely taken with Elissa the moment he met her.



Joyce came from a respectable family, but she didn't have Elissa's looks, and in bed,it was Elissa who pushed him over the edge.


As Elissa kept crying, her shirt slipping from her shoulder, Kenny felt a rush of desire he could not fight.


"That's not true. You know you're the one l want!" Kenny stepped forward and wrapped her in his arms. The way her body pressed against him sent his heart racing. He touched her cheek,drew her close, and kissed her.


Elissa teased him at first, her touch just out of
reach,until Kenny lost control completely, and the two shared an intimate moment right there on the hospital bed.



Not far away, Daisy stood in shock, unable to believe what she was hearing from inside the room.



Those two are clearly shameless.



Glancing over, Daisy noticed Arabella had already removed her mask and was wearing a sly,knowing smile. Unable to hold back her curiosity, Daisy asked, "Did you already know about this?"



Arabella nodded. "That's right. Just wait-the real show is about to begin." She cast a quick look in Joyce's direction.



The moment she spotted Joyce nearby, Daisy took an involuntary step back, eyes clouded with resentment.



Arabella kept hold of Daisy's hand and led her closer to Joyce.



Joyce had come rushing over after hearing Elissa was hurt, but running into Arabella here put her in a sour mood. She scowled. "Why are
you here?"


Arabella answered with a small, confident smirk,"I came to check on Elissa. Is there a problem with that?"



Joyce snapped, "As if you really care. Who do you think you're fooling? Just leave-Elissa doesn't want you here!"


"All right, looks like she needs you more anyway,"Arabella replied, her voice cold and steady.



Puzzled,Joyce shot Arabella a suspicious glance before heading straight for Elissa's hospital room.Reaching the door, she was met with unexpected moaning sounds from inside.Confused,she checked the room number again.It was definitely the right one.



A strange feeling crept in. Did Elissa have a boyfriend? But she had never mentioned anything about that before!



Right as Joyce reached for the doorknob, she caught the sound of a familiar voice drifting from inside the room.



Elissa's words rang out. "Tell me, who do you really love more? Me or Joyce?"
"It's always been you, babe," Kenny said, his voice rushed and uneven. "If you hadn't pushed me to stick around Joyce, I wouldn't have wasted a second on her!"



A soft, teasing laugh slipped from Elissa, her tone thick with fake sweetness. "I knew it. Deep down, I'm the one you want most."



The words hit Joyce like a splash of freezing water,leaving her rooted to the spot.



From inside, the sounds only grew more intimate.Kenny's ragged breathing mixed with Elissa's flirtatious moans. A sharp ache formed in Joyce's chest.


Back in her first days at college, Joyce had met Kenny through Elissa.


Kenny's looks had been striking, but Joyce wasn't smitten right away. She always knew her family background meant she could have chosen someone much more impressive,especially now that the Hyde family's influence was fading.



Over time, Kenny's persistence wore her down,and Elissa never stopped talking him up.
Eventually, Joyce let herself fall for him.


For so long, she believed she was truly fortunate, blessed with both a loyal friend and a caring boyfriend. Only now did she see the truth. She had been completely deceived.



None of it was real. Looking back, she should have spotted the warning signs.



Elissa's harshness toward Daisy should have been a red flag, but Joyce kept telling herself Elissa had a good heart.



Rage bubbled up inside Joyce as the truth crashed down on her. She was ready to barge in and expose them both. But just as her fingers brushed the door, someone grabbed her hand and pulled her away.
###Chapter 68 I'll Destroy
Them Both!



Joyce whirled around to find Arabella was the one keeping her from storming into Elissa's hospital room. "Release me this instant!"



"What exactly do you believe you'll achieve by storming in there at this moment?" Arabella's voice carried a sharp edge. "Kenny's heart has already chosen Elissa. March in there now, and you'll only invite your own humiliation."



"I refuse to let them escape unpunished! I'll destroy them both!" Joyce's voice cracked with fury as she struggled against Arabella's grip.



"Do you honestly believe you possess the power to succeed?" Arabella's stare pierced through her. "You understand Elissa's nature perfectly welL. She possesses an extraordinary talent for distorting reality to serve her purposes."



The words struck their target, and Joyce's struggles ceased. Arabella had spoken an uncomfortable truth-Elissa excelled at
manipulation.



Tears began forming in Joyce's eyes. "Then what alternative do I have? Should I simply stand here and watch them betray everything we shared?"



"I possess a method to ensure they pay a far steeper price." Arabella's tone remained unnaturally calm, as if she was discussing the weather.



Joyce's expression hardened, suspicion creeping into her voice. "Why would I place my trust in you?"



"Because we now share the same enemy."Arabella loosened her grip slightly. "Naturally,you could charge through those doors and create a scene, but consider Elissa's response.She'll paint you as the betrayer, and Kenny will support her version. You'll face suspension,perhaps expulsion."



The rage burning within Joyce began to cool as she recognized the truth in Arabella's words.



Despair crashed over her like a wave, and tears spilled down her cheeks. "What power do you claim to possess?"
"I can ensure they spend every remaining day of their lives beneath the weight of universal judgment." Each word fell from Arabella's lips with deliberate precision.



Joyce studied Arabella's face, her tears gradually stopping as her expression transformed into something cold and resolute."Very well."



Ten minutes passed before they reached a nearby cafe.



Joyce's eyes fixed warily on the masked figure seated beside Arabella. "Who is this person?"



Daisy removed her mask and met Joyce's gaze with quiet composure.



Despite their nearly identical features, Joyce recognized Daisyimmediately.	Their personalities created an unmistakable contrast.



Arabella commanded attention with her presence,her expression typically frozen in cold detachment, rarely betraying inner thoughts.Daisy appeared softer, though her eyes harbored unmistakable resentment toward Joyce.
An uncomfortable sensation stirred within Joyce,but she pressed forward. "Daisy, don't hold my past treatment against me. If you hadn't attempted to seduce my boyfriend-"



"Do you still remain ignorant about the true identity of your boyfriend's thief?" Arabella's interruption sliced through the air like a blade.



Joyce's words died in her throat, and she found herself unable to meet Daisy's gaze.



"Let's address the matter directly." Arabella's voice carried an arctic chill. "You and your friends crippled Daisy by pushing her down those stairs. I need to know exactly who delivered the fatal push."



Although Arabella had conducted thorough investigations, the stairwell had lacked security cameras, leaving the truth shrouded in mystery.


"I was the one who pushed her." Joyce bit her lip, conflict warring across her features. "I believed she was tormenting Elissa,so l..."


Under Arabella's penetrating stare, Joyce could barely maintain eye contact.


"Your father received my message, didn't he?"
Arabella's question came without warning.



Joyce's head snapped up in surprise. "That message came from you? How did you obtain my father's phone number?"



"Your mother remains in the hospital, doesn't she? She hasn't regained consciousness yet."Arabella's tone suggested deeper knowledge than she revealed.



Shock registered across Joyce's face,followed by a flash of anger. "Did you orchestrate that attack? But... how could you possibly possess such power?"



"Did you assume those men in black acted independently? They answer to me as well."Arabella lifted her coffee cup with elegant composure.Her casual revelation sent tremors through Joyce's composure.


"You..." Fear crept into Joyce's eyes. "WVho are you really?"


"I am Arabella, Daisy's elder sister."


"That's not what I meant, and you know it! Just tell me the truth-who's your wealthy patron?"Joyce's gaze turned contemptuous once more.
"Elissa fed you that story, didn't she? She also promised to eliminate me personally?"Arabella's words struck with surgical precision.



Joyce's body trembled slightly. "Have you been monitoring our conversations?"



"Elissa desired my destruction, but observe her current condition." Arabella's voice carried quiet satisfaction.



The image of Elissa lying in her hospital bed flashed through Joyce's mind.



So Elissa had already attempted to strike?


As Joyce studied the elegant, beautiful woman seated across from her, ice seemed to flow through her veins.


"Don't worry. I brought you here to offer an opportunity." Arabella leaned forward and whispered several sentences into Joyce's ear.


Joyce listened, and terror seized her heart.



What manner of monster had she messed with?



When Joyce departed, her movements carried the unsteady quality of someone walking
through a dream.



Daisy immediately turned toward Arabella with concern. "Did Elissa actually attempt to harm you?"



"She did, but don't let worry consume you.As you can see,I emerged completely unscathed,"Arabella's response carried gentle reassurance.


But Daisy's expression darkened with anger."Shouldn't you have shared this information with me immediately? Do you truly consider me so unworthy of your trust?"
###Chapter 69 I Don't Need Much To Be Happy


Arabella saw Daisy's eyes welling up and gently stepped in to comfort her. "Daisy, you matter more to me than anything else. Trust me,compared to what I've been through, this is barely a bump in the road. Don't stress, okay?"


Daisy's brows furrowed with worry. "Have things really been that bad for you all this time?"


Arabella hesitated for a second, then gave a small, almost forced smile. "There are things I can't talk about right now. Not because I don't want to, but... I just can't. Still, I promise... I can handle it. I've always been able to. Okay?"



Daisy didn't push the issue. She nodded slowly,sensing that Arabella had her reasons.



But her eyes scanned Arabella's face and figure with worry. "Are you hurt anywhere?"



Arabella gave a reassuring smile. "I'm alright,promise. Since you finally get a day out, let me show you something nice."
Daisy nodded again, this time with a bit more spirit.



It wasn't often Daisy got to go out, and everything around her seemed so new and interesting. Arabella led her to a high-end boutique, its elegant design exuding wealth and class. Daisy hesitated, shrinking back a little."Should we really go in? This place looks way too pricey."



"It's fine," Arabella said, tugging her along. "I've been working hard to earn enough for both of us. Didn't you see? I transferred some money to you a while ago. Why haven't you spent any of it?"



Daisy looked up with honest eyes. "Because I know how hard you work for it... and really, I haven't needed anything."



Arabella's smile faltered alittle. When she first saw Daisy earlier, she had immediately noticed her clothes-faded, outdated, and clearly secondhand. Even her undergarments looked old and worn-out. That quiet frugality tugged at her heart in the worst way.



She gently took Daisy's hand in hers, her voice
low but firm. "Everything I do-all the hustle,all the pain-it's so you can have more than this.If you don't let yourself live better, then what's the point of me doing any of it?"



Daisy's voice quivered as her eyes filled with tears. "Then don't push yourself so hard. I don't need much to be happy."



Arabella stared at her, briefly speechless. For once, she didn't have a comeback.



Daisy added with soft determination, "And once I get a job, it'll be my turn to take care of you."



That one sentence hit Arabella harder than anything else. Her chest tightened, but she smiled gently and gave Daisy's hands a soft squeeze. "I do it because I want to, Daisy," she said softly. "I know you'd never ask me to go through any of it, but if you told me to live some boring, average life? I'd say no in a heartbeat. This is what I chose. So if I'm out there doing everything I can, and you won't even enjoy any of it, then what's the point? It would mean nothing."



The truth was, Arabella hadn't really had much say in how her life played out, not since her talent was discovered. From that moment on,it
was like someone else had taken the wheel.



Daisy finally gave a tiny smile. "Okay,I understand. I'll do as you say."


Arabella grinned. "That's more like it. Come on."


The boutique was airy and elegant, with only a handful of quiet shoppers. Racks of beautifully tailored clothing lined the walls like artwork.


One of the sales assistants, her lips painted a bold red, was busy chatting on the phone. That was Kate Baxter.



"You absolutely have to stop by, Miss Hudson,"Kate said, her voice sweet and flattering."Everything's been prepared just for you. No one else gets this kind of service,you know."


As Kate continued her call, a younger assistant,Ruth Shannon, gently tapped her shoulder and whispered, "Kate, it's your rotation now."



Kate glanced over at the two girls who had just walked in. After giving them a quick once-over,she scoffed slightly and told Ruth, "You deal with them. I'm on the line with Miss Hudson-an actual customer."
Ruth hesitated, but when she saw Kate still giggling into her phone like she didn't have a care in the world, she decided to take the initiative and approached them with a polite smile. "Welcome! Can I assist you with anything today?"



"We're here for clothes," Arabella replied curtly.



"Of course, come this way," Ruth said, leading them inside.



Arabella guided Daisy around the store and picked out a few outfits for her to try.


Meanwhile, Kate finally finished her phone call.She glanced over and saw Daisy holding a bunch of clothes. With a sneer, she leaned toward Ruth and muttered, "Hurry up and get them out of here. They clearly can't afford this stuff."



Ruth didn't respond. She just gave a soft sigh,clearly annoyed by Kate's constant snobbish attitude.



Fortunately, before any more comments could be made, the entrance bell chimed again. Kate turned and suddenly brightened. "Oh my
goodness! Mr. Johnson, what a surprise!" she said cheerfully.



Arabella was sitting on the couch, looking at her phone. When she heard the name "Mr.Johnson," her head lifted quickly. The moment she saw his face, her expression turned cold.



Bob Johnson walked in proudly and said, "I'm here to pick out some gifts for my cousin."



Kate beamed and gushed, "I was just on the phone with your cousin! You two are so sweet.So,what are we shopping for today?"



Bob opened his mouth to respond, but then his eyes landed on Arabella.



He rubbed his eyes, wondering if he was imagining it.



"Daisy?" he said slowly,completely shocked.



But the woman looked nothing like the shy girl he remembered.Her cold,sharp stare made him uneasy. This couldn't be Daisy. She seemed too confident, too powerful.



Just then, Daisy came out of the fitting room and called softly, "Bella."
She had a smile on her face until she saw Bob.Then her expression darkened, and her body started to shake a little with anger.



What was he doing here? Why now?



Bob looked at Daisy, finally realizing she was the one he knew. That meant the other woman,so calm and fierce, had to be her sister.



Twins? Now that was something



He remembered how Daisy had caught his eye the first day she worked at his store. She was beautiful, quiet, and graceful.



But he never expected her to have a twin sister.



Ideas started running through his head. If he could win over both sisters, his friends would be green with envy.
###Chapter 70 Don't Come Near My Sister Again!





"Hey Daisy, it's been ages since we last met!l honestly didn't think I'd see you walk in here.ls this your sister with you? She's stunning," Bob said with a grin.


Moving closer, Bob chose the seat right next to Arabella.He casually rested his hand behind her shoulders.


Anger flashed in Daisy's eyes. "Leave right now!"


Daisy lunged, ready to force Bob away,but Arabella reacted even faster.



A sharp noise echoed as Bob howled in pain."Ah! My arm!"



At once, the room grew quiet. Kate's eyes widened as she caught sight of Bob's arm
hanging at his side. She quickly covered her mouth, then started screaming. "Do you realize who you just hurt? How could you act like this?Once the Johnson family hears about this, you'll regret it!"


"The Johnson family? WVhy should I be worried about them?" Arabella's voice was barely above a whisper as she spoke. A faint, cold smile spread across her lips.


Her bold and unbothered attitude left the room in shock.



Bob eyed Arabella from head to toe and saw she wore nothing from any big labels. He snapped, his words sharp, "I was being civil by talking to you, you worthless bitch. If you want to keep your place in Griridge, you'd better say sorry right now."


Daisy finally reached her limit. She marched over and slapped Bob's face with all her strength.
A bright red mark appeared on his cheek while he stared at Daisy, completely stunned.


He had always thought Daisy was gentle. Now,she had actually hit him.


The humiliation of being struck by two young women in front of so many people left Bob seething with rage.


Daisy glared at him, her voice rising. "Don't come near my sister again!"


"You have a lot of nerve," Bob said through clenched teeth, his glare sharp. "You seem to forget how much influence I have in this city.You and your sister will find no place in Griridge.Mark my words."


Rising from his seat, Bob yelled at Kate, "Get them out of here!"


Puffing herself up, Kate shot the sisters a smug look. "Fuck off right now!"


With a cold stare, Arabella retorted, "| didn't
realize Eclat let salespeople decide which customers to kick out,"


"Eclat doesn't serve people who only come in to browse without buying anything," Kate said,folding her arms and staring them down wvith clear hostility.


A worried look settled on Ruth's face. She turned toward Kate and remarked, "Kate, this isn't right. You know our policy says we have to treat every customer with respect at all times."


With a dismissive snort, Kate replied, "That rule is for actual customers. Do those two even look like they're planning to buy anything? They've just been wasting time, trying on outfits with no plans to make a purchase."


Bob fixed a nasty grin on Arabella and Daisy,then said mockingly, "So, you two want these outfits? Spend one night with me, and I'll buy every single one for you. How about it?"


Although anger simmered in him, he still
couldn't take his eyes off their faces, letting his desire take over.


Daisy didn't hesitate. She spit straight into Bob's face and shouted, "You're disgusting!"



A slow, angry wipe crossed Bob's face, his hand shaking from fury. "All right then! I'll take every piece they tried on. Bag them up now!"



When she heard that, Kate's face broke into a bright smile. "Of course, Mr. Johnson! Right away!"


She rushed up to Daisy and yanked at her dress. "What are you standing around for? Get those clothes off before you mess them up.Let's be real, even if we put you up for sale, you still couldn't afford them!"


Standing tall, Arabella reached out, seized Kate's hand, and shoved her to the side. Kate nearly lost her balance as Arabella stared her down. "Who said you could touch my sister?And for your information, we're not done with
these outfits. If he wants them, he'll just have to wait until we're finished."


The frustration on Kate's face grew even stronger, and she snapped, "You could never afford anything here. Don't waste everyone's time."


Choosing to ignore Kate completely, Arabella turned her attention to Daisy and said softly,"Take your time. Try on more if you like."


Before Kate could make another move, Ruth quickly intervened and said, "Hang on, Kate.Why don't you go and see if Mr. Johnson needs help with something?"


Kate sneered, "You really are clueless, Ruth.Can't you see they have nothing? Those two nobodies won't help you reach your sales goals."


Though she was full of contempt, Kate couldn't bring herself to yank the clothes away and was forced to guide Bob elsewhere to look at other
pieces.


Pain throbbed in Bob's arm, yet he stood his ground and would not budge.


He stayed put, eager to see the sisters embarrassed once they couldn't afford to pay.


After ten minutes, Daisy finished changing out of the outfits. Arabella, looking pleased, picked out several handbags for her to try as well.



With narrowed eyes, Kate let her sarcasm show."You're still here? Seems like the less people have, the more they want to flaunt it."


Bob kept his eyes on the pair, silently anticipating their downfall.



Arabella turned to Ruth and said, "Please wrap all of these up."


For a second, Ruth was caught off guard. "Of course. I'll ring up your purchases right now."


The shock on Kate and Bob's faces was impossible to miss. Kate quickly sneered, "Oh,
so the act continues? As if you'd ever pay for any of this."


Bob's mind echoed the same doubt. He truly believed the sisters were bluffing.


Ruth checked the register, then remarked, "The total comes to $1.2 million."


She gave Arabella a quick,uneasy glance.


Without hesitation, Arabella produced a credit card and handed it over.


The polished black card caught the light,making it clear that this was something special.


Everyone in the room froze, too stunned to react.


This was not just any card. Only five hundred of these black cards existed, reserved for those at the highest level of society.


Kate finally found her voice after a moment of disbelief and said, "You must be joking. As if anyone could just pull out a centurion card-"
Before Kate could finish, the machine beeped.The payment went through. Ruth handed the card back with a polite smile and began wrapping the items.



More than a million spent in a single transaction...



A wave of dizziness washed over Kate. Was this girl really that wealthy?
###Chapter 71 Why Are You Moving Out





Bob stood frozen, struggling to accept what he was seeing.How could any of this be real?


His voice dripped with sarcasm as he sneered,"So that's it. No wonder neither of you wanted to leave with me. You've already found yourselves a sponsor,huh?"


His lips curled with contempt. "Guess you figured out how to get what you want by sleeping around-"



Arabella cut him off, her tone steady but undeniably threatening. "Sounds like the Johnson family is losing its grip. Maybe that's why you're so bitter and running your mouth."


She leaned in just a bit and continued, "And since you seem so familiar with this world, is that how your family does business-by hopping into bed with the right people? Maybe
I'll pass that rumor to the press."


Bob retorted, "What are you talking about! My family is in the top five in all of Griridge! | don't need to hustle for deals on my own. If anything,you're the suspicious one,coming up with all that cash at your age."


Arabella only shrugged. "Enjoy your comfortable life while it lasts. Good fortune doesn't stick around forev/er."


"Who do you think you're intimidating?" Bob didn't buy her act, but there was something in that steady, unreadable stare that sent a shiver crawling down his back.


Something about this woman set him on edge.She had an energy that made her hard to challenge.


His injured arm began to throb, and though he wanted to keep arguing, the fear of getting hurt even worse kept him in check. With a final glare,he snapped, "You'll regret this!".
He spun around and stormed out.


Kate hurried after him, desperation in her voice."Mr. Johnson, aren't you going to buy anything?"


Bob didn't give her a single glance.


A heavy feeling settled in Kate's chest.



Seeing Ruth grinning ear to ear only made Kate feel worse. That sale meant a big bonus. It was the biggest commission in the store.



She rushed over to Ruth, voice sharp."That was my customer. The commission should go to me!"


Ruth stared at her in shock. "How can you even say that?"


Kate explained, her tone sharp, "The girls were supposed to be my customers. You were only filling in for me, so the commission should go to me!"


Daisy looked like she wanted to step in, but
Arabella stopped her. "Don't waste your breath.She's not getting that bonus."


Taking Daisy by the arm, Arabella led her toward the exit while the argument between Kate and Ruth grew louder. Suddenly, Kate's phone rang.She listened to the voice on the line, then quickly begged, "Please, sir, what did | do wrong?"


The response came cold and fast. "You've made enough mistakes. Clean out your things and leave. You're fired."


"Sir!"



The call ended before she could finish her thought.


Dread settled over her. She had worked hard to land a job at such a fancy boutique. The prestige and pay meant everything to her.Where was she supposed to go now? Who had she upset so badly?


Outside, Daisy looked up at Arabella, her eyes
filled with wonder.


"You really are rich, Bella," Daisy said.



A gentle smile crossed Arabella's face. "Of course. You never have to worry about money again. Buy whatever catches your eye."


"You're incredible." Daisy squeezed Arabella's arm, glowing with admiration. Arabella's smile grew as she guided Daisy toward the jewelry stores.


Their next stop was dinner.



Arabella picked a fine restaurant for their meal.As luck would have it, just as they reached the entrance, they spotted Asher chatting with a group of foreigners.


He spoke their language with ease, his posture straight and his entire presence radiating sophistication.


Asher gave Arabella a brief glance, then returned to his conversation.
Arabella decided not to interrupt and began heading inside. The foreigners finished up and walked away, so she paused and greeted him,"Hi Asher."


"Hello," Asher replied, his voice cold and distant.


Arabella found herself at a loss for words.



Asher remarked, "You can use my private dining room for your meal."



He led them upstairs to a quiet VIP suite. Every corner of the room spoke of refined taste, the space filled with a sense of quiet luxury.



Asher gestured for them to order whatever they wanted.


While Daisy scanned the menu, Asher leaned in to Arabella and said, "Come with me."


To Arabella's surprise, they stepped into a cozy lounge area, complete with a small bed and a comfortable sofa. She settled onto the sofa,and
Asher instructed, "Lower your shirt from your shoulder."


Arabella hesitated. "It's just a scratch. I can handle it myself when I get home."


But Asher was already rummaging in a drawer for a medical kit. His tone left no room for argument."Let me see it. Now."


With little choice, Arabella slipped her shirt off her shoulder, watching as Asher reached for tweezers and disinfectant.



He tended to her wound with careful hands,fully focused on his task. She couldn't help but watch him closely-his skin looked flawless, his features sharp and striking, lashes thick and long.


He was the most handsome man she had ever met.



Suddenly, Asher's deep voice caught her off guard. "Are you finished staring?"
Arabella, caught in the act, felt a twinge of embarrassment but answered boldly, "Yeah, I'm finished."


Asher let out a quiet sigh, as if he couldn't believe how direct she was about it.



Arabella changed the subject. "I wanted to let you know-Daisy's recovered. Thank you for everything you did for us. We'll be moving out Soon."


The words had barely left her lips when a sharp sting shot through her arm. She winced, doing her best not to react.


Asher pulled his hand away, his tone even and hard to read. "Why are you moving out?"
###Chapter 72 You Lied To Me




"We've bothered you for too long," Arabella said sincerely. "You've already done so much for us."


"You're not bothering me at all," Asher replied calmly.


Arabella was quiet for a moment, unsure how to respond.


"What's going on here?" Daisy's voice suddenly called out.



The door swung open, and from where Daisy stood, she caught a glimpse of Arabella with one shoulder exposed and Asher crouched in front of her. The scene looked far too intimate at first glance. Alarmed, she rushed in, ready to pull Asher away, but then her eyes landed on the injury.


"Bella?" Daisy gasped, her eyes quickly brimming with tears. "You lied to me."
Arabella, caught off guard by Daisy's reaction,scrambled to explain. "It's really not serious.Just a small cut..."


But her voice trailed off under Daisy's gaze.


"It was Elissa, wasn't it?" Daisy said firmly, her eyes suddenly cold and sharp.


The serious look vanished so fast that Arabella wasn't sure if she imagined it. When did her usually sweet, bubbly sister start looking like that?


"Elissa's going to pay for this," Arabella said quietly.


Asher didn't say a word. He just continued tending to Arabella's wound until it was clean and bandaged. Daisy sat down beside them,quietly thinking.


Later, during dinner, the atmosphere was strangely quiet.


Daisy and Asher both focused on Arabella,
silently making sure she was comfortable and had everything she needed. For once, Arabella felt a bit overwhelmed by the attention.


"You should eat too," she said to Daisy, gently placing a dish in front of her. Daisy smiled softly but then looked down again, deep in her own thoughts.


Arabella served Asher next. He looked at her but didn't say anything.


After dinner, Asher's chauffeur drove them home.


Once they arrived, Asher went straight to his study to finish some work.


Not long after, there was a knock at the door."Come in," he said without looking up.


Arabella stepped inside, holding something small in her hand.Her voice was quiet. "I made this ring for you. It's my way of saying thank you."
Asher felt a little moved. He looked over and saw it was a cat-shaped ring. "This is for me?"he asked.


She nodded. "You mentioned once that you liked cats, so l designed it this way. But it's not just for looks. It can track your health, and if there's an emergency, you can send an alert,record audio, or call someone."


She showed him how to use the features. "If you keep coming home for dinner, I can tailor your meals based on the health data it tracks."


Asher watched her closely as she explained,her lashes slightly fluttering. Then he asked, almost without thinking, "And what about when you move out?"


There was a faint, hidden sadness in his eyes.


Arabella thought for a moment. "If I have time,l could still come by and cook for you or maybe teach your chef how to make healthy food."


Asher's face turned serious. "I don't want to eat
their cooking," he said quietly.


"Okay, then I'll cook for you," Arabella replied,thinking it was the least she could do after everything he had done.


Asher held out his hand. "Put it on me."



His fingers were long and well-shaped-elegant in a way that made anyone who appreciated details pause for a second.



Arabella carefully slipped the ring onto his finger. The small cat-shaped design caught the light just right, fitting him surprisingly well.



Asher looked at her and smiled. "Thank you."



"You're welcome," she replied, returning his smile. "I'll get going then."


"All right."



Once she walked out, Asher faced his laptop again. The video meeting was still on. "Let's continue," he said coolly.
The meeting resumed smoothly, but behind the scenes, the executive chat group was far from quiet.


"Did anyone see that? Mr. Gordon actually smiled!"



"Yeah,I saw! W/ho was that girl at his place?"


"If she can make him smile, maybe she's the one! She sounded really young,though!"


"But isn't he engaged to Miss Hudson?"



"Engaged, but not married. Things can change."



***



Over the next few days, Arabella and Daisy focused on rehearsing their performance.


Daisy picked up the steps fast-she moved with grace and instinct, her natural talent shining through with each practice.


In the evenings, Arabella would cook, and the three of them, Asher, Arabella, and Daisy,would
eat dinner together, sharing quiet moments and light conversation. It became their simple routine.


Before long, the ninth rolled around.


And the next day... would be the tenth.



At the hospital, Elissa was watching TV when Kenny walked in. "Tomorrow's the tenth,Elissa,"he reminded her.



"So?" Elissa replied carelessly. "Arabella's out of the way. No one's going to find out what we did."



Kenny nodded, but something still didn't sit right.


Elissa noticed the worry on his face and laughed. "Relax-they're just two orphan girls.What can they really do to us?"


"Yeah,you're right," he said, trying to convince himself. Still, part of him couldn't help but feel disappointed. The sisters were'exactly his type
-he couldn't forget them so easily.



Just then, both their phones buzzed with a message.



Elissa unlocked hers and read the message aloud. "Are you guys ready?"
###Chapter 73 You're Smarter Than Usual






Elissa froze for a moment, her fingers starting to shake. What was happening? Wasn't Arabella supposed to be dead?


Kenny leaned over to glance at her phone, then handed her his own. They had received the same message at the exact same time.


"You don't think... Arabella's still alive?" Kenny asked, a cold chilI creeping up his spine, like someone was watching them from the dark.


"No chance," Elissa responded firmly. "Didn't you see? It was timed perfectly. Someone must've scheduled it!"


"You really think so?" Kenny muttered under his breath.


Elissa seemed sure, until another alert popped
up on her phone. "Live Broadcast Preview-Confessions of Griridge University Bullies. See you tomorrow at 11AM."


What the hell was that supposed to mean?



Her heart jumped. She opened the stream and saw nothing but a black screen with one line."DM me if you want the inside scoop tomorrow."


The viewer count was climbing fast, and the comments were going wild.


"What even is this?"



"No clue."



"Griridge University bullies? Isn't that the top school around? They have that kind of stuff going on?"



"Probably someone who got bullied made this.I'm on their side!"
"Bullies are the worst. I hope they all get exposed."


"Wait... I think I know this story. Didn't the bully leave the school already?"


"Tell us!"



"Nah, can't say it here."



"I'm definitely tuning in tomorrow."



"Just saved the stream. I'm ready."



Elissa could barely breathe. Panic was closing in on her.


Kenny read the comments, then turned to Elissa with worry. "Are you sure Arabella's gone?"


"She's not alive," she said sharply, regaining her composure. "This has to be Daisy. She's probably trying to play hero. But it doesn't matter. As long as we don't show up, there's
nothing she can pin on us."


But Kenny wasn't so sure. "I'll call Joyce and see if she got the same message."


He quickly called her. Joyce said she got the message too, but her tone was surprisingly relaxed. "You're awfully relaxed about this," he said,confused.


"Let's be honest," she replied coolly. "We don't really have a choice. We have to show up."


"That doesn't sound like something you'd say,"Kenny replied. "You have something planned,don't you?"


Joyce chuckled. "You got me. Look, if we skip it,everything still gets leaked, and we're finished.But if we show up and apologize, maybe we can fix things, at least a little."



Kenny narrowed his eyes. "You think that'll actually work?"
Joyce's voice was more confident now. "We'll show up and pretend to play along, but then pull out at the last second. There's no solid proof.We'll get a few classmates on our side. Let's be real-who do you think people will believe? Us,or Arabella?"


The idea made both of their eyes light up with excitement.



Elissa nodded approvingly. "Not bad. So,everything's set?"


"Leave it to me," Joyce assured her. "You're still recovering, so I'll take care of the rest. Kenzie and the others are on our side-they'll speak up for us when the time comes. Skipping the stream would be the worst idea. At least this way,we can defend ourselves."


"You're smarter than usual," Elissa said with a faint smile.
Joyce's smile widened. "We've got to be smart about this. If we're not, even our fathers' firms could get dragged into the mess."


Elissa's smile turned cold. "Let's see how Daisy handles the backlash. Tomorrow, everything she's done will come back to bite her."



Back at the Gracebourne villa, Arabella was in the kitchen when Daisy walked in with a phone in hand. "Bella, someone from the university is calling.Should I answer?"


Arabella wiped her hands and took the phone."I'll talk to them."



She answered, and the voice on the line quickly said, "Miss Stanley, we saw the live stream preview. We sincerely apologize for what happened-we weren't aware of your situation.But please understand, this was all Elissa's personal doing. Griridge University values its reputation, and this is the first time something
like this has occurred. The online reaction is intense. Would you consider removing the school's name from the stream?"


Arabella's tone turned cold. "Even if I remove it,people will stillfind out Elissa was from Griridge.It won't make a difference."


The caller hesitated before adding, "As a gesture of goodwill, we're prepared to offer $500, 000. Would that be acceptable if you agree to leave the university out of it?"


Arabella didn't answer right away.



She knew the school wasn't entirely to blame,but they weren't innocent either.



Daisy had been bullied for so long, and no one stepped in, not a single teacher tried to help.



Just then, a deep voice cut through the moment."Let me take it."
Asher had entered the room without them noticing. Arabella handed him the phone.



He brought it to his ear, his voice cold and unyielding. "Who taught you to brush off responsibility like this?"



There was a pause on the other end, followed by a nervous voice. "Mr... Mr. Gordon?"
###Chapter 74 Give Me A Full List




"Are you paying any attention to what I'm saying?" Asher's voice turned icy cold.


A nervous reply came right away. "I'm sorry, Mr.Gordon. I was only thinking about how this might affect the school's reputation. We have to protect the school's good name."


Asher's tone was sharper than ever. "So your idea of protecting the school is to cover things up with hush money? I want you to look into who knew Daisy was being bullied and stood by doing nothing. Give me a full list."


"Understood," the person responded quickly,not daring to say anything else before ending the call and rushing off to handle the task.



Asher set his phone aside and looked over at Arabella. "Sorry about that, Arabella," he said earnestly.
She offered a gentle smile. "Don't worry about it. You have a lot to deal with-it's only natural for a few things to get missed. No need to blame yourself."


Her gaze drifted to the cat-shaped ring on his finger, and she grinned. "How's it working out for you?"


A genuine smile broke across Asher's face,brighter than she had ever seen. "It's perfect.At this rate, I hardly need my personal doctor anymore."


Arabella's own smile grew warmer. "I'm glad to hear that."



Off to the side, Daisy watched them, a quiet smile spreading across her lips as she listened.



"I'll drive you both tomorrow," Asher said, his voice steady.


"Thank you," Arabella replied, nodding."Dinner's almost ready."
They sat down to share their meal, and afterward, everyone headed off to their rooms for the night.


It was a peaceful evening. The moon glowed softly over the city, casting a blanket of calm, as if nothing could disturb the night. But while everything felt serene at home, Arabella's live stream channel online was drawing more and more attention. Viewers flooded in, all wanting to find out the truth about the bullies at Griridge University and what had really happened.


The next morning after breakfast, Asher drove them to the designated place.



Arabella had already reserved a conference hall for the meeting.



The meeting was scheduled for eleven,but by ten-thirty the conference hall was already packed with people eager for drama.


Arabella, Daisy and Asher took their seats near the back of the room.
A few minutes before eleven, Joyce, Elissa,and Kenny entered. Elissa moved slowly, supporting herself with a pair of crutches.


As they walked in, the crowd's attention locked onto them.


Even though Arabella had never released their names to the public, online investigators had already put the story together.


"Is that them? They look so normal-hard to believe what they've done behind the scenes."



"That's Elissa in the middle, right? She seems so sweet, but you can tell she's just pretending!"


"How shameless can you get?"


Someone in the crowd hurled an egg, just missing Elissa's white dress.


Fury flickered across her face as she faced the noisy crowd.



The three of them headed to the front,where
seats had been reserved on the stage.


Disgusted glances and whispers filled the audience.



Elissa shifted uncomfortably in her chair, but deep down, she felt thrilled, convinced that soon she would get her revenge.


Without warning, the large screen behind the stage came to life.


Everyone turned to look. It now displayed a flood of photos and videos showing Joyce,Elissa, and Kenny bullying other students. Their victims' faces were blurred out, but every detail of their own faces was crystal clear.


Shock rippled across their expressions.



Some of the images were so old, even they struggled to remember when they had been taken.


But there was no' denying it-every one of those pictures showed the truth.
Arabella had managed to dig up every last piece.


"Good morning, everyone. Today, I will show you the real faces of the three notorious bullies from Griridge University." A cold, steady voice echoed from the back of the room.


Arabella moved to the front, her face covered by a mask, yet her poise and striking beauty still stood out.


Elissa's eyes grew wide with fear. "Arabella,you...you're not-"


Arabella finished the thought for her. "Dead,is that what you're trying to say?"



Elissa quickly tried to compose herself, forcing a cold edge into her voice. "What do you want now?"



Damn it! Arabella just wouldn't go away, no matter what they tried. All that money spent was for nothing.
Rage burned inside Elissa, but she knew this wasn't the time to let it show.


Arabella's voice was cold and steady. "As I said,please explain to everyone what you've done at Griridge University over the years."



Elissa's head dropped as tears slid down her cheeks, her white dress making her look even more fragile. "I'll admit it. I made some mistakes, and I'm truly sorry," she said, her voice trembling. "But I had my reasons. It wasn't all my fault-she brought it on herself!"


Suddenly, her tone grew sharp and defensive,startling the audience.



People blinked in surprise, then turned to each other with confused and angry whispers. "What is she even saying?"



"She's still trying to make excuses? Give me a break!"


"Unbelievable. I've seen the evidence. This is plain bullying. There's no excuse-she needs to
apologize!"


The room was filled with murmurs of disgust,nobody buying Elissa's explanations.


Elissa glared at Arabella. "You claim I bullied you,but what exactly did I do?"


Arabella's expression didn't change. "Let's start with what you did to my sister Daisy-how you broke her leg."
###Chapter 75 She Earned Every Moment Of Suffering!




The screen flickered as the results materialized with startling clarity.


Arabella's voice cut through the silence like a blade. "Campus security footage reveals everything. Immediately after class ended,you dragged Daisy into that stairwell. Minutes later,they carried her out-drenched in blood."


"Dear God!"



A spectator's hand flew to cover their mouth,horror etching across their features. "That's absolutely savage!"


"Revolting! That manipulative witch needs to pay for her crimes!"



Elissa's gaze swept across the screen.She was momentarily stunned by Arabella's meticulous
preparation, but she recovered swiftly with a sharp retort. "If you're determined to destroy my reputation with lies, then I'll expose what really happened! I confronted Daisy because she tormented me repeatedly-for months!"


Emotion strangled Elissa's words as tears pooled in her eyes, transforming her into a portrait of wounded innocence.


The students in the audience rose as one, their movement creating a ripple of solidarity.



Kenzie's voice rang out with conviction. "You have to trust us-Elissa possesses genuine kindness. She's shown us nothing but compassion. How could anyone believe she'd terrorize a classmate? We witnessed everything firsthand. During class, Daisy relentlessly attacked Elissa. I stood there in that stairwell,watching Daisy tear her down, sneering about how worthless she was, how she'd never measure up..."


"Precisely! Daisy destroyed Elissa emotionally,
so if Elissa finally defended herself, justice demanded it. Besides, she never actually harmed Daisy-we simply refused to associate with someone so venomous! Nobody wanted friendship with that kind of poison!"


"Absolutely! Daisy embodies pure malice! She victimized Elissa constantly!"



The testimony from over a dozen students sent confusion rippling through the crowd like wildfire.


What was going on?



Elissa's declaration boomed across the room."If I truly terrorized Daisy, I'll eat my hat!"



Her vow silenced the assembled masses.



"What's happening here? With so many students defending Elissa, I'm completely bewildered."


"It's impossible that all these people participated in bullying Daisy, isn't it?"
"But what about those photographs from earlier? These three must be scheming something sinister!"


"Those are merely images-we don't understand the complete circumstances. Like Elissa explained, if Daisy attacked her first, then retaliation seems justified, doesn't it? Where's your concrete evidence?"


Arabella bestowed a subtle smile upon the trio."So you're truly committed to this path of stubborn denial?"



Elissa regarded Arabella with weary resignation."| understand your animosity toward me,Arabella, but you cannot assault us with these fabrications. We genuinely didn't commit the acts you're describing-we simply didn't!"


Kenny interjected with fervor, "Exactly right.Daisy lacks any redeeming qualities! It's absurd that a bully can still ridicule.others!"


Joyce remained the sole silent figure among
them.


Elissa's attention shifted to Joyce, who finally spoke with deliberate slowness. "Bullying Daisy was completely justified! Elissa never touched her-I handled everything. I couldn't stomach Daisy's existence. She earned every moment of suffering!"


The bullies' righteous fury rendered the entire room speechless.


Kenzie's voice pierced the stunned silence once more. "Consider this logically, everyone. If Daisy truly suffered as the victim, would she possess the capability to mobilize so many people against her supposed tormentors?


"Truth! Don't let these people deceive you!"



Everyone exchanged uncertain glances, their expressions growing increasingly conflicted as they turned toward Arabella.


"She's right. If Daisy was genuinely the victim,how could she have orchestrated this entire
confrontation and gathered us here?"


"At least currently, I believe Daisy and her sister demonstrate considerable cunning. How could someone so calculating be bullied? Ha,I doubt they possess any integrity!"


"This is outrageous. You manipulated us! How dare you expect us to travel this distance and champion your so-called justice?" someone bellowed furiously, hurling a rotting tomato toward Arabella.


Witnessing this aggression, others began launching projectiles as well.



Daisy's face darkened as she observed the chaos and began rising to her feet, but Asher's voice emerged cold and low. "Arabella anticipated this reaction. If you intervene now,you'll only escalate the disaster."


Daisy's fists clenched untilher knuckles turned white.


Just before any object could·strike Arabella,
several black-clad bodyguards materialized and formed a protective barrier around her.


The bodyguards' commanding and intimidating presence sent shock waves through the nearby spectators.


"Bodyguards?"



"Incredible, they even employed personal protection?"


"And securing this venue must have cost a fortune. Add the private security, and that's beyond ordinary people's reach. Clearly, they orchestrated this entire spectacle to destroy Elissa and her friends. That's pure evil!"


The crowd's hostility intensified like a gathering storm.


On stage, Elissa's lips curved into a satisfied smirk as she surveyed the scene, casting a contemptuous glance at Arabella.


So what if Arabella had survived? Did she truly
believe those photographs could secure a conviction? How pathetically naive. What an absolute joke!
###Chapter 76 How Did You Get This Video





Elissa had scattered people throughout the crowd,all with the job of causing trouble.



Arabella stood to gain nothing from this.Once everything played out, she and Daisy would both be left facing harsh criticism.



Watching Arabella's shocked expression, Elissa felt even more pleased with herself.



The look on Arabella's face was genuine surprise, but she was truly caught off guard by the sudden arrival of the bodyguards.



Her eyes moved from one bodyguard to another, and she quickly noted their impressive skill. These were most likely Asher's men.

Toward the back of the room, Asher was seated,impossible to miss with the authority he carried.
A faint smirk formed on Arabella's lips. When her gaze passed over the agitators in the crowd,a flash of icy contempt lit up her eyes. "Elissa must have paid you all quite a bit, considering how determined you are to stir things up for her."


"What are you talking about?" The troublemakers tried to hide their discomfort, but their shouting only grew louder. "Now that your plot has been exposed, you're accusing us?How ridiculous!"


"I wasn't sure before, but hearing that makes it clear you're just trying to set them up! I have never even met Elissa!"


Even as the troublemakers kept making a scene, Arabella refused to argue with them any further.


Elissa tried to savor her little victory, but a voice from behind made her stop.


"Wow. Daisy, those dance moves aren't bad at
LU

all. Are you planning to audition for the Griridge Troupe now?"


Elissa turned around and saw that a video had started playing on the big screen. In the footage, she was with two classmates, and Daisy was front and center.


Daisy kept her head bowed, her whole body shaking. Anger flashed across her face,but there was nothing she could do.


It was Joyce's voice on the recording, and she was obviously the one behind the camera.


After Joyce spoke, Daisy whispered, "What do you want from me?"


"Lift your head! Stop looking so pathetic!"Joyce exclaimed, yanking Daisy by the hair.


The video kept Daisy's face hidden, as Arabella had made sure her identity would not be revealed to the public.


Elissa pressed her lips together before finally
saying, "Don't be so rough, Joyce. You're scaring her."


"Honestly, Elissa, you're just too soft. This bitch is after your spot, and you still feel sorry for her?" Joyce said, clearly annoyed.


"But... she looks miserable too," Elissa said, her voice faltering.


"Miserable? She's faking it. People like her always get what's coming," Joyce sneered."Daisy, this is your last warning. Drop out of the troupe auditions."


"I'm not quitting!"



"You little bitch!" Joyce snapped, lifting her hand to slap Daisy.



Elissa quickly caught Joyce's arm. "Joyce,stop!"


Elissa then took Daisy's hands in her own and tried to reason with her. "Please just listen to me!"
Daisy tried to break free, and the next thing anyone saw, Elissa was holding onto her shoulders, and Daisy went crashing to the ground.


The footage made it clear that Elissa had used force when she grabbed Daisy's shoulders.



Daisy tumbled all the way down the stairs, and a pool of blood quickly formed around her.



"Oh my God! Is she even alive?" both classmates asked, their voices shaking with fear.



Joyce sounded rattled as she spoke up. "No way! Daisy's always been tough. There's no way she could really be dead!"


"Should we call the police?" one classmate asked, her voice filled with anxiety.


Elissa pressed her lips together, worry in her eyes. "But if we do, everyone will think this was our fault..."
"Forget her. We need to get out of here," Joyce suggested, her voice sharp with panic.


That was where the video stopped.



For a moment, silence filled the room before it erupted in outrage.


"That's sick! And there are still people defending Elissa? I saw her push Daisy with my own eyes!"


"Disgusting! She's nothing but a manipulator!"



"She has to apologize!"



"That's attempted murder!"


The anger swirling in the room was almost too much to take in.



Elissa sat in stunned disbelief. How could this happen? How did Arabella get her hands on that video?


Her first instinct was to look straight at Joyce.Only Joyce should have had a copy of the
recording.



Joyce looked just as shaken, her face drained of color. "This can't be real... How did you get this video?"
###Chapter 77 You Two Are Absolutely Revolting!





Elissa felt the world tilt beneath her feet. Never once had she imagined Joyce capable of leaking the video. Her certainty had always pointed toward Arabella. She was convinced the girl had orchestrated some elaborate scheme to obtain it.


Joyce's words only cemented the crowd's belief that Elissa had been responsible for Daisy's fall.



Their insults grew sharper, more venomous with each passing moment.



A barrage of objects flew through the air, aimed at Elissa, Joyce and Kenny.


"Go straight to hell, Elissa!"



"Shameless creature! Absolutely vile!"


"So because she danced better than you, you
decided to cripple her?"


Elissa twisted and ducked frantically, but a jagged stone found its mark, striking her forehead and sending tears streaming down her cheeks from the searing pain.


Without warning, Joyce shot to her feet and bellowed, "Silence, all of you! We had perfectly valid reasons for targeting Daisy! She's the type of girl who throws herself at someone else's boyfriend!"


Elissa's gaze found Joyce, and a wave of relief washed over her.


When circumstances demanded it, Joyce always proved herself the perfect instrument in her hands.


As long as Joyce raised the specter of Daisy attempting to seduce Kenny, they could paint their bullying as justified retaliation.


"Still trying to frame Daisy with your lies?"Arabella's voice dripped with contempt. "You
claim she seduced him-where's your evidence?"


Joyce whirled toward Kenny with desperate eyes. "My boyfriend confessed it to me himself that Daisy tried to seduce him!"


Every eye in the crowd shifted to Kenny, who found himself trapped in the spotlight. "That's exactly right. She did make advances toward me. Probably because I have wealthy parents."


"You expect us to accept your word as gospel?"Arabella's laugh cut through the air like ice. "I could just as easily declare that you pursued Daisy relentlessly. We were not born yesterday.Since when does your testimony become absolute law?"



Kenny's expression wavered between confidence and uncertainty. "I can't produce evidence, but I swear on my honor I'm speaking the truth! If you refuse to believe me, there's nothing more I can offer."
Elissa's voice emerged slowly, deliberately."Daisy had never encountered anyone of Kenny's caliber before, after all. Her attraction was only natural. Her sole mistake was forgetting he was spoken for."


The moment her words faded, her carefully placed supporters erupted in orchestrated support. "I believe every word! Why would Kenny fabricate such a story?"


"Girls from impoverished backgrounds always fantasize about capturing a wealthy man!"


"Attempting to steal another woman's boyfriend -where's your dignity?"


Elissa shot Arabella a look brimming with calculated provocation.


Her thoughts churned with satisfaction."Everything you've accomplished today has only dragged Daisy deeper into the mud! You actually believe you wield some kind of power?What a pathetic delusion."
"Ah, ah... Come on-take me harder, please! I knew it all along, you're attracted to me, aren't you?"


"Of course I am. In my eyes, you're absolutely stunning! Even if your leg never heals properly,I'd remain by your side forever."


"What are you saying? My leg will definitely recover completely!"



Suddenly, a woman's passionate moans and a man's labored breathing echoed from behind them. Elissa's face drained of all color in an instant.


She convinced herself the sounds were mere hallucinations, but when she spun around, she witnessed herself and Kenny captured on video,bodies intertwined on a hospital bed.


In that devastating moment, Elissa's mind dissolved into complete emptiness.



Kenny recoiled as if struck, his eyes bulging as he stared at the screen in absolute disbelief.
How was this possible? How had Arabella managed to obtain this kind of compromising footage?!


Joyce stood frozen in shock, but seconds later,she unleashed a thunderous slap across Elissa's face before driving her foot into Kenny's stomach with brutal force.


"You two are absolutely revolting! Elissa, I cherished you as my dearest friend, and you seduced my boyfriend behind my back! Kenny,despite your family's financial ruin, I remained loyal to our relationship, and you still had the audacity to betray me!"


All the rage Joyce had suppressed for days finally erupted, and she continued her assault relentlessly/. Elissa's screams pierced the air, her face burning with unbearable agony, shocking her back to reality.


"No, Joyce, it's completely fabricated! This footage has been doctored!" Elissa shrieked desperately.
"You think I'm some kind of fool? You don't believe I can distinguish authentic footage from manipulation?" Joyce's eyes blazed crimson with fury, her hatred radiating like heat. "I always believed you were gentle and virtuous,but I never suspected how thoroughly corrupted you truly were! You've been deceiving me, manipulating me against Daisy,while secretly entangling yourself with my boyfriend! You despicable creature!"



Joyce delivered another savage kick, sending Elissa crashing to the floor. Kenny immediately rushed to assist Elissa.


The sight pierced Joyce's heart. She released a bitter, hollow laugh and declared, "You two truly deserve each other-a manipulative serpent and a fallen heir. You're perfectly matched!Kenny, we're finished forever!"


Tears cascaded down her cheeks as she turned to address the crowd with profound remorse."I'm deeply sorry, Daisy. All this time, Elissa
manipulated me completely. I believed you were a shameless temptress, so l attacked you repeatedly. I'm so incredibly sorry!"
###Chapter 78 We Didn't Do Anything Wrong 




This was the deal Arabella and Joyce had made -Arabella would help her get revenge, and in exchange, Joyce would hand over the old video.


But now, as everything unfolded, Joyce understood that even if she backed out,Arabella would still find a way to get her hands on that footage.


Gasps echoed through the room. Everyone was stunned.


At the back, Daisy sat still, her face composed as she watched Joyce offer her apology.


Forgiveness wasn't on her mind. And it certainly wasn't on Arabella's either.



Arabella shifted her gaze to Elissa and Kenny."So, are you both still refusing to apologize?"
Elissa's fury boiled over as she lunged toward her. "You're the reason Joyce turned against me! You tore us apart!"


But before she could get close, Joyce stepped in and slapped her hard across the face.



Her voice was full of disgust. "Still playing the victim, Elissa? Was she the one who made you sleep with my boyfriend too?"



Elissa froze. Hearing that kind of anger in Joyce's voice sent a wave of panic through her."Joyce,l..."


But Joyce wasn't done. Her words were calm,each one cutting deep. "You're going to pay for every disgusting thing you did. I'll make sure of it."


Elissa's head spun. Her vision blurred, and she nearly collapsed.


Kenny quickly caught Joyce's hand, trying to stop her. "Come on, Joyce, the three of us-we've been best friends for years. You're really
going to side with someone like Arabella over us? It's not what you think. I'll explain everything later!"


Joyce stared at Kenny, her eyes full of bitter disappointment. Even now, he still thought he could smooth-talk his way out of it.


She yanked her hand away and snapped, "Get lost, Kenny! If you still want a shred of dignity,go apologize to Daisy right now!"


Kenny's face turned grim. Apologize to Daisy?Seriously?


Elissa wasn't backing down either. She suddenly laughed, her voice sharp. "You're unbelievable, Arabella. But if you think this is enough to make us give in, dream on. We didn't do anything wrong. You and Daisy are the problem!"


She kept spouting denials, even with no escape in sight.


The crowd erupted in anger. "Elissa, just ----)
apologize already! You're the one who started all this!"



"Bitch! If you don't say sorry, don't even think about walking out of here unharmed!"


"I'm done supporting Tucker Group and Hyde Group. These rich people think they can crush everyone beneath them!"


The uproar was so loud that even the voices of the people Elissa had paid off were lost in the noise.


But despite the chaos and backlash, neither Elissa nor Kenny looked the least bit sorry.


To them, apologizing meant admitting guilt. As long as they held out, there was still a slim hope they could spin things in their favor.


"I've had enough of this circus!" Elissa snapped,dropping her mask and turning to storm off.


Kenny followed closely behind.



However, just as they neared the exit, two men
stepped into their path-Bennie and Hayden,both clearly fuming.


Without a word, Hayden stormed up and landed a punch right across Kenny's face.


"You little brat!" he barked. "How many times did I tell you to treat Joyce right? And now you've gone and betrayed her? You ruined that girl's name!"


Still seething, he grabbed Kenny by the back of the head and shoved him forward, forcing him into a bow. "Apologize, you idiot!" he shouted,making sure the entire crowd heard him.


The pain was sharp, but what stung more was the public humiliation-Kenny's eyes brimmed with tears.


He wanted to hold out, but Hayden leaned in and hissed, "If you don't apologize now, we'll lose everything. Do you really want to drag the whole company down with you?"


That made Kenny's blood run cold. His father
wouldn't lie about something like that.


Just who was Arabella,really?



"I'm sorry. I lied. Daisy never came on to me.I liked how she looked and tried to approach her,but she turned me down. Out of spite, I spread false rumors," Kenny said, clenching his fists and squeezing his eyes shut as he forced the words out.


The response, both in the room and across the livestream, was instant and furious.


"Spreading lies about a girl like that? Pure evil!"



"If her sister hadn't stepped up, Daisy's entire future could've been destroyed!"


"This is unforgivable. Hyde Group-you've lost me for good."


Hayden glanced at Arabella. When she gave.a subtle nod, he turned back to the crowd. "This is my fault as a parent. I'll ensure the victim receives proper compensation; and Kenny will
be disciplined accordingly."


Without waiting for a reply, he dragged Kenny out of the venue.



Elissa stood frozen in disbelief. Had Hayden really lost it?


But then, Bennie stepped beside her and said urgently, "Elissa, apologize. Right now."


"Dad, what? Why should l? Once I apologize,there's no way to undo it!" Elissa cried out, her voice trembling with disbelief.



"If you don't, we'll be bankrupt in less than an hour!" Bennie hissed, his teeth clenched. "The Gordon family is involved now!"
###Chapter 79 Do You Believe This Is Finished




Gordon family?! Elissa's eyes expanded with pure terror. "Is it that Gordon family?"


That legendary family-so deeply entrenched in wealth and legacy they practically had their name etched into old money itself-was now targeting her family? And all of this... over Arabella?


Elissa turned slowly to Arabella, her eyes brimming with disbelief and fear.



"Have you forgotten the Gordons hold substantial shares in Griridge University? Your actions have dragged the university's reputation through absolute filth-they won't tolerate this disgrace!" Bennie declared with stern authority.


Only then did Elissa experience a fragment of relief, but the prospect of publicly apologizing
caused tears to flood her eyes. Several seconds passed before she bowed her head and whispered, "I'm sorry for disappointing everyone. I did terrorize Daisy."


But before any projectile could strike her, Elissa couldn't suppress her instincts and bolted from the stage.


Bennie cast a conflicted glance toward Arabella,then departed as well.



Kenzie and the others hadn't anticipated the situation spiraling to this devastating point.



Witnessing the crowd seething with resentment toward Elissa and her group, they quietly prepared their escape when a clear,commanding voice sliced through the air. "Do you believe this is finished?"


Kenzie met Arabella's piercing gaze and shivered violently. "We... we are innocent. We
never realized Elissa was fabricating everything..."


"Yeah, we're sorry, but we genuinely didn't intend for this to happen."


Arabella's eyes narrowed slightly as she released a quiet laugh, yet it carried a powerful sense of menace. "In bullying cases, every bystander becomes an accomplice! And you-you were active participants. You're even more reprehensible than accomplices! Do you honestly believe a casual claim of ignorance can erase the devastation you inflicted on the victim?"



Arabella's words resonated deeply with everyone present.


"She's absolutely right. You're not innocent whatsoever! Didn't you just want to curry favor with the bullies?"
"Sacrificing others for your own advancement-you're more despicable than the bullies themselves!"


"Who are these people anyway? Does Griridge University still want shameless students like this?"


"We, uh..." The group found themselves speechless, unable to raise their heads under the relentless scolding.


At that moment, their phones erupted with notifications. Kenzie was first to examine hers.Griridge University had just posted on Twitter.


"In light of the recent campus bullying incident,we extend our sincerest apologies. Due to our failure in supervision, those responsible were allowed to go unchecked. The faculty members involved have been dismissed, and all implicated students-led by Kenzie-will be expelled. We are taking a zero-tolerance stance
moving forward to ensure student safety. Thank you for holding us accountable."


Kenzie stared at the screen as if it had personally betrayed her. Her hands went limp.Her knees gave way. She dropped to the floor.


Her whole world came crashing down in a heartbeat.She came from nothing. Getting into Griridge University had been her one-way ticket out of mediocrity. Her family had started treating her differently, and for once, she had felt she was going places.


Now, it was over. Expelled.



She couldn't fathom how those around her would mock her relentlessly.



Kenzie was utterly shattered, and the surrounding students appeared equally devastated. Regret was etched across their faces like permanent scars.
Arabella stepped onto the stage, her voice ringing clear and resonant. "Thank you all for attending today, and I hope bullying will never again poison our schools!"


The live stream exploded with excitement.



"| used to witness people getting bullied, and l wanted to rescue them but was too terrified to intervene. From this moment forward, I will champion every victim!"


"Let all the bullies vanish from this world!"



"Agreed! Here's to a world free from school bullying!"


Arabella took one final look at the live stream,terminated it, and after bidding farewell to everyone,exited the conference hall.


She waited in the parking lot for Asher and Daisy when her phone erupted. It was Joshua."I'm sorry. I failed to complete the task you
assigned me."


Arabella's brow furrowed. "What happened?But representatives from both the Hyde and the Tucker families still appeared."



"By the time I made a move, both companies were in complete chaos. I heard the Gordons were moving to acquire them. I figured if the Gordon family was already involved, there was no purpose in us taking further action."


Arabella understood, experiencing a complicated surge of emotions. Asher had been exceptionally generous to them.


"I understand." Arabella ended the call, lost in contemplation.



Soon Daisy approached and embraced Arabella tightly.


"Thank you so much, Bella." Daisy's soft voice carried the tremor of suppressed tears.
"It's my failure for not protecting you."Arabella's eyes softened as she patted her back gently. "No one will ever harm you again."


"Thanks..." Daisy lifted her head, her eyes red-rimmed but her spirit blazing with exceptional brightness.


Arabella glanced at Asher. "Let's return home."



"Okay." Asher retrieved his car keys and settled into the vehicle.



During the journey home, Daisy chatted endlessly with Arabella.



"You've already memorized your dance routine,"Arabella said, glancing at her. "Now that this nightmare is over, you can finally go back to practicing with the troupe tomorrow."


"I'll give it my all!" Daisy grinned, pumping her fists.
Arabella chuckled."Good."



Once home, Daisywent to rehearsewhile -Arabella pulled Asher aside. "I need to talk to you," she said quietly.



Asher looked at her, calm as ever. His deep,penetrating eyes were unreadable-still and cold,like a lake right before a storm.
###Chapter 80 I Did It Myself





Arabella pressed her lips together, feeling a strange tension building inside her, but she decided to speak up anyway. "Thank you for everything you've done for us these last few days. I won't forget how kind you've been."


"What now?" Asher's eyes turned cold in an instant, and a sharp edge crept into his demeanor, as if he already knew what Arabella would say next.


She took a breath and continued, "I think it's best if Daisy and I find a place of our own. We can't keep relying on you forever."


His expression remained frosty, his voice flat."Is that what you want?"


"Yes, I'm sure..." Arabella managed to say,but Asher had already turned his back and walked away before she finished.
An uneasy feeling surged in her chest.


She had no idea what Asher was thinking.



Taking in two strangers must have been a hassle for him, right? Shouldn't he feel relieved now that they were leaving?


Her mind drifted as she got back to her room,eyes unfocused while she stared at her phone.


News was spreading quickly online.



The Tucker Group, the Hyde Group, and even the Lambert Group were all facing heavy boycotts. However, since Joyce issued an apology right away and Nathan made a donation of twenty million, they were not hit as hard as the others.


Griridge University also sent Arabella financial compensation.


Everything was falling into place.



With things here settling down, she knew it was time to focus on the future.
Arabella thought about a certain name, her eyes narrowing as she called Joshua. "How are things going with the assignment I gave you?"


"Don't worry. Everything's moving along just fine. But what made you want to start a restaurant all of a sudden?"


Arabella answered in a steady voice, "I started thinking about those years | spent in the lab,always working and never really tasting good food. After I left, I finally discovered how many wonderful things there are to eat. Still, a lot of people have stomach problems. I want to create meals that can help them feel better. And,honestly, there's someone in that neighborhood I haven't forgiven yet."



Joshua perked up. "I get it! That sounds amazing. I'm handling the renovations at the restaurant, and it's almost finished. Do you want me to help you search for a chef?"


"That would be great," Arabella responded."Also, could you check on the properties listed
under my name?"


Joshua was quick to agree. "Sure, but what's got you curious about that all of a sudden? Are you planning to move out?"


"Yes," she replied without hesitation.



Joshua sounded surprised. "You mean it? What made you decide?"



Arabella kept her tone calm. "Daisy and |shouldn't keep staying at Asher's. It isn't right to keep depending on him."



"He wants you to leave?"


"No,it's my choice."



Joshua was disappointed but did not try to talk her out of it.



Right after Arabella ended the call, a knock echoed from the door. She walked over and opened it to find Asher standing in the hallway.



The light in the corridor made him look even
more striking, shadows playing across his features. His gaze was deep and unwavering as he spoke. "You gave me a gift, so I have something for you too."


He lifted his hand, and as his fingers opened,she saw her cherry blossom pendant resting in his palm. Arabella's eyes grew wide in surprise.


Maryam had crushed the pendant once before,but now it looked flawless.



Arabella took it in her hands and opened the locket, seeing the photo inside completely untouched, not even a hairline crack.


She turned to Asher, surprise and gratitude mixing on her face.


"Did you ask someone to repair this for me?"Her voice was full of thanks. "It's perfect-just like it was before."


"I did it myself." Asher's eyes never left her,and her heart fluttered at the thought. It amazed her that someone as busy as Asher would take time
to fix it with his own hands.


She met his gaze, drawn in by how deep and intense it was.



A wild possibility flickered in her mind for just a second.



Was it possible that Asher truly cared for her?



"If you want to move out, I won't stop you. But if you'd like to stay, you'll always have a place here." His voice was soft and steady as he spoke.


Arabella held the pendant close, not sure how to respond.


Without warning, Asher reached out and gently ruffled her hair. "Take your time. I'll be here whenever you decide."


His words lingered in her mind, heavy with meaning.


She managed a small nod, watching as Asher left the doorway. When she returned to her


room, her thoughts spun in every direction. She had never dated anyone before, but she could sense Asher's kindness was genuine. There was something deeper in the way he looked at her,and it left her feeling breathless.
###Chapter 81 You Had Better Honor That Promise!





Arabella's fingers traced the pendant's surface before she opened it once more, her touch reverent as she caressed the photograph nestled within.


Creating something this intricate demanded more than steady hands-it required tools of extraordinary precision, each movement calculated to perfection.


Her contemplation shattered when her phone's shrill cry pierced the silence. A doctor's voice carried urgent news. "Bella, you wanted me to monitor Elissa's progress. Her situation has deteriorated dramatically-her leg is decomposing, and walking may never be possible again."


"Decomposing? What could have caused such
devastation?" Arabella's brow furrowed with confusion.


"The circumstances baffle me as well. My investigation revealed something disturbing-Elissa carries poison within her system. It operates with cruel subtlety, undermining her defenses over extended periods, manifesting in countless debilitating symptoms. Death won't claim her immediately, but suffering will define her remaining years. The troubling reality extends beyond her case..."


The doctor's voice then descended into hushed tones. "Khloe endures identical torment. Her facial scars have worsened, beginning their own grotesque decay. Meagan collapsed from overwhelming anxiety upon learning the truth,and our tests revealed her immunity had plummeted below normal thresholds. All three women exhibit symptoms that mirror..."


"AIDS." Arabella breathed the word into existence.
"Precisely. The situation defies explanation.Only a skilled toxicologist could orchestrate such sophisticated destruction," the doctor admitted, bewilderment threading through their words.



Arabella's memory seized upon a discovery from Daisy's residence-The Ancient Healer's Handbook,that mysterious medical tome.


Her breath caught as she whispered with desperate urgency, "This information must remain buried from other eyes."


The conversation ended, leaving Arabella collapsed against the sofa cushions, her emotional landscape in chaos.


Her cherished sister-once radiating sweetness and vivacious energy-had she truly mastered the dark art of poison creation in shadowed secrecy? Daisy had embodied pure kindness and untainted innocence in.years past.


"Bella." Daisy's melodic voice floated from the
doorway's threshold.


Arabella's gaze snapped upward, her composure reassembling with practiced swiftness. "Please, come inside."


Daisy glided into the room, her observant eyes studying Arabella's expression with careful attention. "Your appearance troubles me. What weighs upon your mind?"


"Nothing of consequence. What brings you to my presence?" Arabella said, though the doctor's alarming words continued their relentless circulation through her thoughts.


"Longing for your company brought me here!"Daisy's radiant smile bloomed as she settled beside Arabella, her arms encircling her sister's with affectionate warmth. "Does tomorrow hold any obligations? Would you accompany me to the dance troupe's gathering?"


Those innocent eyes sparked something protective within Arabella's heart, and she
couldn't suppress her indulgent smile."Absolutely."


"That's great!" Daisy's excitement illuminated her features.



Curiosity then colored her tone as she ventured,"| witnessed your conversation with Asher earlier. Did it carry significant weight?"


"Nothing particularly meaningful."



"Very well, if privacy surrounds the matter, l understand completely.Promise me you'll seek rest at an early hour!" Daisy's sweet smile graced her lips once more before she departed from the room.


Arabella's gaze followed Daisy's retreating form.She struggled to reconcile her beloved sister's gentle nature with the possibility of such ruthless poisoning.


Unknown to Arabella, Daisy's path leddirectly to the study, where she pushed open the door with deliberate purpose.
Asher remained bent over his work, her arrival failing to surprise him in the slightest.


Daisy approached with measured steps, her eyes fixed downward upon his concentrated figure.


"You're into Arabella," she declared, her words carrying certainty.



Asher abandoned his tasks and met her gaze,his response delivered with unshakeable calm,"What outcome do you desire?"



"You and Arabella exist on separate trajectories.Your family thrives on manipulation and calculated schemes, and furthermore, your engagement to another woman remains intact!"Daisy's voice carried undertones of rising fury."Arabella would never unite herself with your cause. Abandoning this pursuit would serve you well. Tomorrow marks our departure from this place!"


Innocence had vanished completely from
Daisy's demeanor-only arctic coldness inhabited her eyes now.


This dramatic transformation failed to catch Asher off guard. He had already penetrated the carefully constructed layers of Daisy's true character.


Arabella remained blinded by the masterful facade her sister maintained.



Having delivered her inflammatory challenge,Daisy prepared to pivot toward the exit.



"But will Arabella discover happiness once she departs from here?" Asher's question emerged with unhurried deliberation. "No soul in this world possesses the capacity to provide her with greater abundance than I can offer.Beside me, her existence could transform into something infinitely more effortless. She has already sacrificed tremendous portions of herself for your benefit. Do you truly wish to condemn her to perpetual exhaustion?"
Daisy's movement ceased abruptly, her body freezing mid-stride.


She had observed how Arabella's tension melted away whenever Asher graced their vicinity with his presence.


The truth struck her with undeniable force-Asher embodied the perfect fusion of extraordinary wealth and devastating physical appeal.


Nevertheless, surrender remained foreign to Daisy's nature. "I'll become her pillar of strength! I refuse to allow you to steal her from my embrace!"


Terror gripped her heart at the thought that,after finally reclaiming Arabella's poresence, she might witness her sister's departure once again.


Occasionally, merely observing other women's sisters embrace matrimony left Daisy gasping for breath, suffocated by overwhelming dread.The prospect of watching Arabella exchange
wedding vows would prove absolutely unbearable.


"My lineage represents a distinguished family whose legacy spans centuries. Do you genuinely believe overnight transformation could elevate you to match such formidable standing?"


Asher then added, "Furthermore, stealing Arabella from your side never entered my intentions. Her devotion to you runs deeper than ocean currents. Separating you two would be impossible, and frankly, no one but myself would even attempt to preserve that sacred bond."


His response flowed with measured tranquility and infinite patience.


Daisy's hands formed tight fists at her sides.



Despite her reluctance to acknowledge the reality, Asher's words carried undeniable truth within their depths.
The Gordon family's protective umbrella could indeed transform Arabella's existence into something magnificently easier.


Daisy's glare burned into Asher's composed features. "What fate awaits your promised bride?"



"Does a simple verbal declaration truly constitute genuine engagement in your understanding?" Asher's reply carried arctic coolness. "Had I desired it, she would have become my wife already. However, my heart beats exclusively for Arabella."


Daisy's teeth sank into her lower lip, her mind scrambling unsuccessfully for any meaningful counterargument.


Asher's voice continued its relentless advance."Rest assured, your hidden nature will remain buried within my silence. Through Arabella's eyes,you shall eternally remain her cherished,sweet younger sister."
"You had better honor that promise!" Daisy's sharp retort preceded her furious departure from the room.


With one complex matter finally reaching resolution, Asher permitted a subtle smile to grace his lips, his shoulders releasing their accumulated tension.


The tranquil moment shattered when his phone erupted into demanding rings. He lifted the device, and a woman's voice emerged-so gentle and melodious that it possessed the power to ensnare any ordinary man's heart completely. "I've come home, Asher. Would tomorrow evening's dinner hold appeal for you?"
###Chapter 82 Thank You For Giving Her A Chance





"We do need to meet up," Asher responded.


Rosie Hudson didn't hesitate. "Let's go to Bob's restaurant.How about it?"


"That works for me." Their chat was brief, and Asher ended the call soon after.



Setting her phone aside, Rosie was immediately approached by Bob, who asked eagerly, "Did Asher agree to meet you tomorrow?"



"Indeed, he did." Rosie nodded, a small smile on her lips as she glanced at her reflection in the mirror. Her features were as delicate as ever,and she couldn't help but feel a flicker of satisfaction. "I didn't think he'd say yes so fast."



She recalled how, last time, she had expected Asher to come collect her,but he hadn't
bothered to show.


To make matters worse, rumors swirled that Asher had brought another woman with him that night.


Rosie had been fuming when she found out.



Being a Hudson lady and the most well-known socialite in Ockford, Rosie had always known that both her family and the Gordons wanted her to marry Asher. He never gave a definite yes or no, leaving her hanging, which felt like a slap in the face.


Eventually, Rosie calmed down and saw things from Asher's perspective.


She understood there was no sense in pushing a man who was used to getting his way,especially someone with Asher's background.


Bob didn't hesitate to flatter her. "Naturally, he said yes. There isn't a single person in Ockford who measures up to you. If you two end up together, he's hit the jackpot!".
He grinned and added, "Just wait, when you and your fiancé visit, I'll make sure the whole city knows."


Rosie shot him a playful look. "Fiancé? We're not officially engaged yet."



Bob flashed her a confident grin. "It's just a matter of time, you'll see. Now, I'd better get going on tomorrow night's menu. I'll make sure you and Asher have a meal to remember."


Rosie nodded in agreement, then paused as something came to mind. "Oh, have you seen that new restaurant across the street? It actually looks pretty fancy."


Bob let out a dismissive laugh. "They think they can open an upscale place nearby? That's wishful thinking. Give it a few months, they'll be packing up and leaving."


The following day, Arabella accompanied Daisy to dance practice with the troupe.



Seeing Daisy blend in so well with the other
dancers put Arabella at ease.


With a bit of free time on her hands, Arabella wandered over to Jennifer's office. But when she arrived, she realized Jennifer already had company.


The office door was cracked open, and Zoe's anxious voice carried into the hallway. "Ms.Dawson, my student is incredibly gifted. Can't you reconsider and make an exception for us?It's been ages since l've had a student stand out. If this keeps up, my days at this facility are numbered."


Not long ago, both Elissa and Joyce had been expelled, and their teacher, Zoe,lost her job for failing to supervise them.


The whole ordeal had hit Zoe hard.



Now Zoe was stuck teaching at a tutoring center, and her reputation was on the line.Getting her current student into the dance troupe could turn things around, and maybe
attract new pupils.


Jennifer's tone was sharp, her patience clearly worn thin. "I told you before, you already had an excellent student. The problem was you never valued her."



Zoe's expression soured. "I couldn't have guessed Elissa would get mixed up in something like that..."



"Elissa?" Jennifer repeated, her brows lifting in surprise.



"Wait, weren't you talking about Elissa?" Zoe asked, her confusion written all over her face.


Jennifer rolled her eyes, but her attention shifted as she caught sight of Arabella in the doorway. Even with her mask and hat, there was no mistaking her.


Arabella gave a quiet nod in greeting.



Jennifer caught on immediately and didn't bother sugarcoating her words. "No, I was
referring to Daisy. Elissa isn't even relevant here. Honestly, Zoe, you really can't spot talent when it's right in front of you, do you?"


"Daisy?" Zoe blurted out, suddenly at a loss for words.


Truthfully, she had always known Daisy had skill,but after the girl's leg injury, she never considered her a contender.



But if Jennifer, the notoriously tough judge,was offering praise, then Daisy must have serious potential.


The previous dancer Jennifer had complimented went on to become an unexpected sensation, earning recognition all across the country.


Regret washed over Zoe. If she had stepped in and stopped the bullying earlier, maybe she wouldn't have lost her position. If she had given Daisy a chance, perhaps she would have discovered a star in her own classroom.
Now Zoe's reputation was in ruins, and once news of her dismissal.spread, the most talented students made sure to steer clear of her.


Left with only part-time gigs at a tutoring center, she scraped by on the bare minimum.


Confronted with her situation, Zoe finally saw how far she had fallen, and where she was likely headed.


Zoe wandered out of the office, her thoughts spinning with regret.


But no amount of remorse could rewrite the past.


Once Zoe had left, Arabella stepped inside.Jennifer's face brightened at the sight of her. "I have to say, Daisy's got real talent. She fits in perfectly with the troupe."


Arabella managed a small smile. "Thank you for giving her a chance."


She paused, lowering her voice. "There's
something else. I think someone in the association has Lailah's back."



Jennifer's expression shifted to shock. "Who could it be?" "I haven't narrowed it down yet,"Arabella replied, calm and steady. "But whoever it is, they have significant access. I reported Lailah's misconduct, and it never made it to the top."
###Chapter 83 You Never Told Me You Could Cook            




"Lailah?" Jennifer frowned slightly. "Didn't Patrick recommend her? And knowing the kind of person Patrick is... I find that hard to believe."



Patrick Stone, one of the vice presidents of the Dance Association, handled publicity. He had been a respected dancer for many years, well-regarded in their circle.



Arabella thought for a moment. "If that's true,maybe Patrick's the one pulling the strings."



Jennifer hesitated. Truth was, she had always gotten along well with Patrick. "Actually," she said after a pause, "he's dropping by today."


Later, during a break in the studio, a tall figure walked in. Several of them stood and called out,"Hello,Mr.Stone."
Patrick offered a warm smile. "Taking a little break? That's good. We've got a show coming up soon, so I just dropped by to see how things are going."


Lailah turned to him enthusiastically. "We're all set! Would you like to see the routine now?"



"Of course," he said with a nod.


Wasting no time, Lailah called everyone to their positions. The dancers quickly got to their feet,and the music began.


Patrick stood there smiling, though his eyes gradually settled on Daisy.



She could feel the weight of his gaze, sharp and focused, but it didn't faze her in the slightest.She kept dancing with the same grace and confidence as always.


Patrick's smile faltered just a touch. Then,without drawing attention, he let a small marble fall from his hand, sending it rolling toward Daisy's feet.
If she stepped on it, she could easily trip,maybe even get badly hurt.


Just then, a calm voice cut in. "MAr.Stone."


Arabella had stepped right on the marble, her calm gaze locked on Patrick.


For the briefest moment, Patrick's face twisted,but he quickly covered it with a polite smile."And you are?"


"I'm Daisy's sister," Arabella replied casually,gesturing toward her. "We've always had each other's backs, so I just tend to worry if someone's trying to push her around."


Patrick's eyes briefly flickered, but his pleasant expression didn't waver. "That's fair," he said smoothly. "But don't worry. The vibe here is really upbeat."


"Let's hope it stays that way," Arabella said coolly. Then, as if remembering something, she glanced down. '"Oh, I think | stepped on something just now..."
She crouched and picked up the marble,holding it up for everyone to see. "Strange. This was just lying here. If someone had stepped on it mid-dance, it could've caused a serious injury."


Her voice carried through the studio,catching everyone's attention. Dancers gradually stopped and turned toward her, unsettledby the sight of the marble.


"We're not even allowed to bring stuff like this into the studio. How'd it end up here?"



"Did someone drop it accidentally?"



Arabella looked straight at Patrick, her expression one of innocent confusion. "You were the only one who came in just now, Mr.Stone. Did you happen to see who dropped this?"


Patrick's smile tightened. "No, I didn't notice anyone. It's a good thing you spotted it-let's tuck it away before someone gets hurt."
"Sure, I'll hang onto it," Arabella replied sweetly,slipping the marble into her pocket with ease.


Inside, Patrick was fuming. Was she messing with him on purpose, or had she just stumbled into this? If it was planned, her timing was perfect. And that little remark-was it a warning?


He caught Lailah's eye, and they exchanged a quick,loaded glance.


This wasn't the moment to act. Not yet.



In a pleasant tone, he said, "Everyone's rehearsing right now. Even if you're Daisy's sister, this isn't really the place to linger. How about we step outside?"


"Alright," Arabella replied casually and followed without resistance.



She was sure of one thing now-after being caught red-handed, neither of them would dare make another move anytime soon.
But this little stunt had confirmed what she had suspected-Patrick was the one pulling strings for Lailah.


Later that day, Arabella headed to her new restaurant to train the chefs on how to make food that was easy on the stomach.


Joshua had shown up as well, observing from the side as Arabella wrapped up a dish. It looked great and smelled even better.


"You never told me you could cook," Joshua said, surprised. But the moment he took a bite,his smile disappeared right away.


Arabella looked confused. "What's the matter?Does it taste awful?"


But she remembered Asher and Daisy eating it without a single complaint.


Joshua struggled to get it down and leaned in,asking softly, "Who else has eaten your cooking?"
"Asher and Daisy," she replied.


"Forget Daisy, but Asher? He must be crazy about you." Joshua chuckled and gave her a dramatic thumbs up.



Arabella gave him a rare look of annoyance.


Joshua dropped the teasing and got serious."It's healthy, sure. But the taste? Kinda painful,to be honest. People don't eat ouut just for health -they want something that actually tastes good."


"Is it really that bad?" Arabella took a bite and didn't see the problem.



Joshua sighed. "You've been in labs too long.You're used to food most people wouldn't even sniff. No wonder your taste buds are shot!"



Then, turning to a nearby chef, he added, "Hey make something for her, will you?"


A moment later, the chef brought over a plate of garlic pork chops.
Arabella took a bite, and Joshua leaned in eagerly. "Well? What do you think?"


"It's tasty," she admitted. "But way too greasy.That kind of oil content could give someone a fatty liver."



That was when it hit Joshua-Arabella's standards were way too rigid when it came to food.


"Alright, fine. Let's find some middle ground,"he muttered in defeat.


They spent the rest of the afternoon tinkering with recipes, but Arabella was still far from satisfied. Eventually, she had to put it on pause and go pick up Daisy.


"Bella!" Daisy called out, rushing over the moment she saw her at the opera house entrance.


Arabella took her hand with a smile. "Come on,let's go check out some houses!"
"Houses? What for?"



"You said you wanted to move out, didn't you?"Arabella had thought it over. No matter what,Daisy came first.
###Chapter 84 You Opened A Restaurant




Daisy didn't hesitate for a moment. "I've made up my mind. Honestly, I like it here. I'm not planning on going anywhere else."


Arabella arched an eyebrow, suspicion lingering in her voice. "Are you sure about that?"


Linking arms with her friend, Daisy grinned and kept her tone light. "Absolutely! Asher treats us well, and besides, if we leave, he'll probably miss us. We'd be abandoning him!"


Even as she spoke cheerfully, she was calling Asher an asshole silently.



A gentle wave of relief washed over Arabella,though she couldn't quite explain why.



Memories of Asher's unreadable stare surfaced in her mind, and for a split second, she believed leaving might actually break his.heart.
"How about grabbing a meal at my new place?"Arabella suggested with a smile.


Delight sparkled in Daisy's eyes. "You opened a restaurant? No way! That's so cool. Show me everything!"


Their conversation carried them down the block, but as they turned the corner, Daisy picked up on something odd.


The restaurant Arabella owned was practically next door to Bob's, just one street over.



Daisy shot a questioning glance at her companion, but Arabella didn't bother hiding the truth. "Honestly, I wanted Bob to learn a lesson. At the same time, I figured it would be good for everyone if I just went for it and opened a place here."


The words hung between themn, and Daisy's heart twisted with gratitude and a tinge of guilt."You don't have to go to all this trouble for me.I'm serious, nothing happened with Bob. He
didn't have his way with me."


A soft hand brushed Daisy's hair as Arabella met her eyes. "Someone like Bob deserves consequences. If anyone should be the one to deliver them, why not me?"


Unable to argue any further, Daisy let out a quiet sigh. Arabella spoke with gentle conviction. "This isn't just about you. It's something I want for myself. Don't let it make you feel bad,alright?"


A little nod was all Daisy could manage. She whispered, "You're the best. I love you," before pulling Arabella into a hug.


Arabella wrapped her arms around her, warmth flickering in her eyes. Then, just as quickly, her gaze sharpened. Across the street, through the restaurant window, she spotted Asher sitting by the glass.


Seated on the other side of the table was a woman dressed in white. Even from afar, there
was something striking about the way she carried herself.


Arabella froze, watching closely, while Daisy picked up on the tension. Her anger flared the moment she saw Asher across from the mysterious woman. "I can't believe him! Asher's sneaking around with someone else. I'm going in there to give him a piece of my mind!"


Intent on confronting Asher, Daisy made a move toward the door but felt Arabella's hand clamp down on her arm.


Firm and calm, Arabella called out, "Daisy, wait.Let him be. He's free to date anyone."


Daisy glared, clearly struggling to hold back."That's ridiculous! You know how he actually-"She caught herself mid-sentence, her expression clouding as she bit back the rest.


A gentle warning laced Arabella's voice."Asher's done plenty for us, Daisy. There's no need to start a fight."
Bitterness churned inside Daisy, but she only threw Asher a smoldering look before trailing after Arabella, saying nothing more.


Silence fell between them as lunch arrived.Arabella kept her eyes down, and Daisy couldn't help but worry as she watched her sister push food around her plate.


Moments later, Arabella checked her phone, her expression unreadable. "I think it's time we found a new place," she announced abruptly.


The words set Daisy on edge. "Did Asher do something to you?" she demanded, already half out of her seat.



Shaking her head, Arabella turned her screen so Daisy could see the headline. "Rosie Hudson and Asher Gordon's Upcoming Engagement!"


The announcement had only been made five minutes earlier, yet it had already climbed to the top of the trending charts.


A flood of shock hit the table. Daisy's knuckles
whitened as she gripped the edge, barely containing her outrage. "How could he go behind your back like this?"


The outburst made Arabella jump. "Daisy, calm down!"



Tears pricked at Daisy's eyes as she blinked away her anger, her voice trembling. "I just feel like you don't deserve this."


Confusion flickered in Arabella's gaze. "Why are you so worked up?"


Searching for an answer, Daisy fell silent.Arabella still had no idea about Asher's true feelings.


Letting the subject drop, Arabella straightened her posture and offered a small, steady smile."Let's not dwell on it. The food's getting cold."


Before she could lift her fork again, her phone buzzed across the table. A new message from Asher popped up on the screen:
His text was casual, almost cheerful. "Is Daisy done with dance for today? Want me to come pick you up later?"



Arabella's jawtightenedassheread the message.



It amazed her how Asher could cozy up to someone else, then text her as if nothing had changed.
###Chapter 85 We're Not That Familiar




Arabella didn't text back. She quietly continued eating, though her expression remained frosty the entire time.


The tension in the air made Daisy uneasy too.She didn't dare break the silence. But as she studied Arabella's face, an anxious feeling crept into her chest-was it possible that Arabella had feelings for Asher too?


It wasn't clear, but she could sense a hint of fruIstration behind Arabella's calm exterior.


Over at the upscale restaurant, Rosie had just arrived. She casually posed near the window,subtly leaning closer to Asher while chatting.


She saw a paparazzo in the distance flash an "OK" hand sign. Pleased, she turned to Asher with a soft smile. "How's the food here? Do you like it?"


But Asher's attention was elsewhere. His eyes were glued to his phone-Arabella hadn't replied,and that unsettled him. Without looking up, he
replied flatly, "I didn't come here to eat. I have something serious to say."


Rosie straightened up instantly, her heart racing with anticipation. "Alright, I'm listening," she said eagerly.


Was this it? Wlas Asher finally going to accept the proposal their families had been pushing?


Looking at the elegant and undeniably attractive man before her, Rosie struggled to keep her excitement in check.


But Asher's next words hit her like a slap. "Tell your family to drop the marriage talk. I don't want it brought up again."


His face was unreadable, but his entire demeanor gave off a chilling vibe.


Rosie froze in shock, staring at him in disbelief."What did you just say, Asher?"


"We're not that familiar," he said coolly."You can just call me Mr. Gordon."


Rosie felt like the ground had dropped beneath her. She nearly bit her tongue, stunned and humiliated.
"Then... Mr. Gordon," she said through clenched teeth, trying to steady her voice, "can I at least ask why? I mean, in terms of status, I'm your best match. And I'm not exactly lacking in looks either."


Asher didn't even blink. "That's not something you need to ask," he said bluntly. "Going forward,keep your distance. And I don't want to see any more rumors linking us together. If I have to clarify things publicly, it'll only make things worse for you."


With that, he stood and left without a second glance.


Rosie sank into her seat like all the strength had been drained from her, completely stunned.


Just then, Bob came rushing over. "What happened? Why did Asher leave like that?"


Rosie didn't answer. Her hands clenched tightly in her lap as she stared at the table. Her vision blurred with tears, and it took every ounce of willpower not to flip the table in frustration.


Bob could tell something was very wrong. A chilling thought crept into his mind-had Asher
never intended to marry Rosie at all?


"Didn't you ask him why? Honestly, who could be a better match than you?" Bob tried to comfort her. "Look, if a man turns down someone like you,there are only two possible reasons-either he's not into women, or he's already got someone else in his heart. Love's weird like that."


"He's not gay!" Rosie snapped without hesitation.Anyone could tell Asher was straight. Her jaw clenched in frustration. "So he really is into someone else?"


Bob replied, "Then we just need to find out who it is. Maybe he's just momentarily blinded. You're from a powerful family-he's bound to come back around. Don't let one rejection shake you."


His words jolted Rosie back to her senses.



He was right-she had let one blow shake her too much.


Regaining her calm, Rosie adjusted her tone,measured and elegant. "You're right. The Gordon family wouldn't allow him to marry just anyone."


She quickly pulled out her phone, got in touch
with the paparazzo, and had all posts tying her to Asher taken down. Then she posted a clarification, stating they were only friends and had no engagement plans.


Her statement quickly won public favor online.


"Even if they aren't getting married now, they totally will later!"


"Rosie is so gracious-clearing things up instead of clinging to fame like certain attention-seekers."


"That kind of class is why Rosie's at the top of the social ladder."


With comments flooding in like praise songs,Rosie smiled with satisfaction.


Shortly after Asher left, he saw Arabella and Daisy walking out of the restaurant across the road.


It looked like the place had just recently opened.


A few minutes later, Joshua stepped out, and Asher made his way over.


Joshua was on a call with his driver when Asher suddenly appeared. He jumped a little. "Mr.Gordon?"
Asher gave a curt nod. "Is this your new restaurant?"


"Technically, it belongs to Arabella," he answered truthfully.


As soon as her name came up, Asher's gaze darkened slightly. Why would she suddenly decide to open a restaurant?


From the moment he met her, it always felt like every step she took was part of some bigger plan -usually tied to revenge.


The only real competition this new place she was opening posed wNas to Bob's upscale restaurant.


Joshua saw Asher glance at the street and instantly broke into a cold sweat. His sixth sense was terrifying.


Joshua gave up the act. "You're right. She opened it to compete with Bob. But we've been stuck all day trying to come up with a menu that works."


"Why's that?"


"She wants it to be both nutritious and tasty,which is hard. You've tasted her food, so you
know," Joshua added with a sigh.


After thinking for a beat, Asher said, "I'll send over our family chef in ten minutes."


Joshua blinked. "Wait, are you serious?"


Asher replied, "He can try making something that fits Arabella's standards."


Joshua stood there stunned. Was this really happening?


Not long after, Asher got into his car and placed a call to his mother.


Back at the Gordon family's estate. Cecily Gordon -elegant and graceful-was watering her garden.When she saw the name on her phone, her brows lifted in surprise. It was her son.


She answered, her tone playful. "Well now, what a rare treat. You're calling me personally? What do you need?"
###Chapter 86 What Do You Think You're Doing




"I need your chefs," Asher said calmly.


Cecily raised a brow. "How many are we talking about? I'll have them reassigned immediately."


"All of them," he replied bluntly. "You'll have to hire replacements."


Without waiting for her response, he hung up.


Cecily's expression turned sour. That ungrateful boy!


She turned just in time to see the butler escorting the chefs out-each one of them world-class,handpicked at a hefty price. And now, Asher was snatching them all away without a second thought. Who was gonna cook for her now?


But as she fumed, a thought struck her. Asher had never cared much for luxury meals. He wasn't the type to steal chefs just to enjoy fine dining.


Was he... planning to open a restaurant?


Her suspicion grew. Something was definitely up.
Back at the Gracebourne villa, Asher had just finished settling the restaurant arrangements when he stepped through the door, only to find Arabella and Daisy coming downstairs, dragging their suitcases behind them.


He stopped in his tracks. "What's going on?"


Daisy shot him a glare. "You're getting engaged to someone else, remember? Obviously, we're moving out."


He turned to Arabella. "Is that how you see it too?"



Arabella's expression was unreadable, her tone flat. "That's right."


Asher stared at her for a moment, then quietly reached out and took her hand. "Come with me."


Daisy could only grit her teeth as she watched the two of them walk away.


Once inside Asher's room, Arabella immediately pulled her hand back. "Say whatever it is you want to say and get it over with,"


she said icily.


Asher just gave a faint smile, which only made her more irritated. She turned to walk away, but
before she could take a step, he wrapped his arms around her from behind.


His familiar scent surrounded her, and for a moment, Arabella froze. Then she started to struggle as his breath brushed softly against her ear.


"| won't lie-I did consider marrying Rosie once,"he whispered.


Her jaw clenched. "Then go ahead. Marry her.That's none of my business."


But Asher didn't loosen his hold. "I met with her today to end it properly. There's no engagement.She brought paparazzi, but I made her set the record straight."


Arabella's resistance faltered slightly, though her face was still tense. Then, without warning, she felt a soft, warm brush against her cheek. She turned sharply and met Asher's eyes, shining with intensity and something deeper she couldn't quite name.


"What do you think you're doing?" she snapped,her voice low and guarded.


Asher lightly brushed her cheek again. "You're blushing," he murmured.
She swatted his hand aside. "Shameless," she muttered, irritation flaring in her voice.


To her surprise, Asher let out a low chuckle, the sound rumbling through his chest-it was strangely captivating. "You're seriously adorable,"he teased.


What a jerk! He was clearly enjoying this!



She lifted her hand, ready to smack him, but he didn't even flinch and just stood there, watching her with eyes so gentle it caught her off guard.


But in the end, her hand fell. She took a breath and said coolly, "You may not be marrying her,but sooner or later you'll marry someone. It's only right for us to move out."


A flicker of frustration passed through Asher's eyes.He went quiet for a moment, then asked in a soft voice, "Have you ever wondered why I never left your side?"



Arabella's brows drew together in confusion.


"At first, it was out of obligation-my father asked me to look after you and Daisy," he said honestly."But then... I couldn't stop watching you. The more I saw, the more I got pulled in."
His eyes held hers, and she felt like the air in the room had shifted.


Her face was burning now. She wasn't used to this kind of intimacy, wasn't used to feeling anything like this, but strangely, she didn't mind it.


Her teeth grazed her lip as she stayed quiet, not knowing what to say.


Asher went on, "Over time, I realized I wanted to do more for you-to help you let go of all the anger and just live a peaceful, happy life. And honestly, seeing you smile... that makes me happy too."


He had never fallen for anyone before, but when it came to Arabella, his feelings were undeniable.


Arabella's cheeks flushed deeper, her heart thudding a little faster.


"There was a time I thought love didn't matter and that marriage was just a transaction," he said,his voice firm now. "But I was wrong. If I can't be with the person I truly love, then l'd rather not marry at all."
###Chapter 87 You Make Me Sick




Arabella bit her lip. "Are you saying I'm the one you love?"


"That's right," Asher replied without hesitation.


"|..."



Before she could even get another word out,Asher gently covered her mouth. "| know you haven't really thought about this yet. And I'm not going to rush you. Just take your time."


Arabella looked down. "What if I never figure it out?"


"Then that only means I haven't done enough to make you feel loved," he said honestly.


Her heart skipped a beat.


It had been a long time since someone made her feel this accepted-without pressure, without expectations.


Then, out of nowhere, Asher's tone turned cold."Put those things back."


Arabella pouted but nodded obediently. As they
opened the door, they found Daisy standing right outside, clearly having been eavesdropping.She looked a little embarrassed. "So, are you two done talking?"


Arabella gave a small smile. "Yeah, we're done.Come on, Daisy, let's unpack."


Asher leaned against the doorframe, his gaze fixed on Daisy. "No one could ever take Arabella's place in my heart. You don't need to worry."


Daisy didn't look happy about it, but after Rosie's public clarification, she was starting to think maybe it had all been a misunderstanding.


"I'm not giving you endless chances," she said coolly.


"I won't need more than one," Asher replied calmly.


He picked up their suitcases and carried them back upstairs, placing each one in the correct room.


A moment later, Arabella received a message from Joshua. "The chefs Mr. Gordon sent over are amazing! I just tasted one of the dishes, and it's incredible!"



Arabella blinked in surprise but felt a little thrill
inside. She glanced at Asher, who was standing nearby, casually leaning against the wall with his usual effortless charm and a faint smile playing on his lips.


"I'm heading over now," she said aloud.


"I'll drive you," Asher offered immediately.


Arabella looked at him for a second but didn't say no.


***




At the restaurant, Joshua was a bit taken aback when he saw Arabella walk in with Asher, but he quickly led her to the kitchen to taste the food.


While Arabella was focused on tasting, he leaned closer and muttered, "Why does it seem like Asher has way too much free time lately?"


Arabella raised an eyebrow in amusement."What's that supposed to mean?"


"Isn't he a CEO? But somehow, wherever you go,he magically appears too."

Arabella glanced through the kitchen window and saw Asher quietly working on his laptop from the couch. He wasn't slacking-he was simply making time to be by her side.
"The flavor's solid," she said, dodging Joshua's remark. "But the seasoning still needs a little tweaking..."


She threw herself into the task, adjusting spice after spice until the sky began to brighten. After countless tries, she finally got the first dish just right. With that breakthrough, things moved quicker, and they finished the rest in no time.


When Arabella finally stepped out of the kitchen,it was already seven in the morning. Asher was still on the sofa, focused on his laptop. When he looked up and saw her, he set it aside and said softly,"Come here."


She walked over and sat beside him. Asher reached out, slipping an arm around her waist."Are you tired?" he asked softly.


"I'm fine," she replied simply.


She had pulled plenty of all-nighters in her life, so this wasn't anything new.


Asher looked at her seriously, lowering his head a little. "From now on, try to get things done during the day. Let the team handle the rest. You don't need to do everything yourself."


"I know," she murmured in response.
Then, all of a sudden, Arabella glanced toward the window, and her eyes narrowed slightly.


Asher followed her gaze and noticed it too-Rosie and Bob were clearly cut from the same cloth.


"Want me to send them away?" Asher asked.


Arabella gave a half-smile. "There's nothing for them to see from out there. Once the place officially opens, people-watching will be normal.If Bob's getting nervous, it just means we're doing something right. He's scared."


"Let's head home then." Asher took her hand naturally, as if it was the most ordinary thing in the world, then stood and led her toward the exit.


Arabella looked down at their linked fingers,quietly puzzled.


Since when did he start doing this?


Joshua followed them out and nearly did a double take.



Hadn't Arabella said there was no chance with Asher? Then how did things get to this point?


On the ride back, Arabella felt a little drowsy.


The city was starting to come alive, with office
workers rushing to start their day.


As they drove past the Lambert Group building,she glanced out the window and suddenly spotted two familiar faces-Joyce and Kenny.


She narrowed her eyes for a moment, then shut them again.


Their downfall was already written, and Arabella knew she didn't have to get invoIved. Sooner or later, they would be buried in debt on their own.


The company was in bad shape, which was why Joyce had stepped in to try and save it.


However, what she didn't expect was for Kenny to show up too.


"Joyce, please," Kenny begged, grabbing her arm."Things are tough for both of us. If we announce our engagement, it'll give the stock price a boost!"


He stared at her with eyes brimming with hope.


Joyce tilted her head slightly, acting like she was actually thinking it over. "Hmm... sounds like a tempting offer," she said slowly.


As he heard that, Kenny's face lit up right away.
Deep down, he believed Joyce still loved him enough to overlook everything.


In his mind, she was nothing more than a naive girl he could keep stringing along.


But Joyce gave him a cold, mocking smile. "And then people can say, 'Look, there go the two bullies back at it again.' Perfect,right?"


Kenny's face stiffened for a second. But he quickly covered it up. "There's no need to speak like that," he said gently. "I really believe that as long as we're together, we can turn everything around."



The Hyde Group was basically falling apart.


The Lambert Group still had a little time left,so Kenny knew he had no choice now.Joyce was his only shot at salvaging what was left.



But Joyce's face turned icy. She yanked her arm out of his grip and stared at him with pure disgust. "Are you serious right now? You slept with Elissa behind my back, and you still think I'll ever forgive you?"


"That's not true, Joyce! Arabella's the one lying to you!" Kenny argued.
Joyce looked at him, the man she had once loved,and felt nothing but revulsion. "You make me sick,Kenny. I was right outside that hospital room when you were sleeping with Elissa."
###Chapter 88 You've Really Got A Gift For Desserts





Kenny stood there, shocked. He didn't move,completely frozen.


Joyce shouted, "Get out! If you're so desperate to save your family, go back to Elissa. The Tuckers are still doing okay, right? You two can get engaged and let the world gossip all they want.Even bad attention is still attention. Maybe it'll even help your business."


Joyce turned her back and walked off.


Kenny wanted to go after her, but the Lambert Group's guards blocked his way.


He hadn't expected Joyce to cut him off so ruthlessly. Still, his family was crumbling. He had no choice-he needed a lifeline. Maybe Elissa was it.


He pulled out his phone and hesitantly dialed her number. "Elissa..." he said softly.


Her voice came through the line, tearful and weak. "You finally called, Kenny. Are you coming to the hospital? My leg... I really think it's ruined."
Kenny couldn't bring himself to say anything.Seeing her like this, how could he still ask for help?


"I'm drowning in medical bills," she whispered."Can you help me out a little?"


He shut his eyes, guilt twisting in his gut."I'm sorry... The Hyde Group's in massive debt. I really don't have anything left."


"Fine then. I'm going to rest for a bit. I've got a checkup later," Elissa said and hung up.


She glared at her phone and muttered, "Useless."She knew exactly why he had called. He wanted her help saving the Hyde Group. But why should she lift a finger?


She and her family were barely surviving themselves.


Frustrated, she stared down at her injured leg."Why is nothing working?" she muttered. "Is this hospital even trying?"


Just then, a nurse entered. Without thinking,Elissa hurled a cup at the woman. It hit her square on the forehead.


The nurse glared at her, seething. "Miss, this is the top hospital in Griridge. Our doctors are doing
everything they can. You can't keep lashing out like this."


"I've spent a fortune here, and my leg is still far from healing!" Elissa screamed, tears streaming down her face.


The nurse, clearly done, finished her checkup and left without another word. She had seen her fair share of difficult patients, but Elissa was something else entirely.


Alone again, Elissa broke into a fit of rage,throwing whatever she could reach around the room.


At that moment, Khloe walked in and saw Elissa's tantrum. She started crying, covering her face."What about me, Elissa? The doctor said my face won't heal."


"Didn't you get that imported medicine?"


"| did! But it's not working anymore!" Khloe sobbed, staring at her reflection in the mirror."The scars are getting worse every day. I don't know what's happening..."


She looked utterly shattered. How was she supposed to keep up her livestreams like this?


And to make it worse, people online were
demanding she pay Arabella back. She was terrified to even go live anymore.


Elissa looked at her sister and felt despair settle like a storm cloud in her chest. How did their lives fall apart like this?


Her fingers curled into fists.


This was all Arabella's fault.



She and Khloe broke down, crying and complaining loudly, their voices fillingthe quiet hospital halls.


"Enough crying. Get yourselves together,"Meagan said as she walked in with a smug look."We're going to see your grandmother."


"Grandma? She's back?" Khloe asked, surprised and excited.


After their grandfather passed away, their grandmother moved to a quiet estate in the countryside to live in peace.


They didn't talk to her much anymore.


But she probably still had a lot of money, maybe she could help them out of their current mess.Just thinking about it made Khloe feel a little better.
Elissa, too, found herself holding onto a thin thread of hope. "Let's go see her now," she said without hesitation.


About half an hour later, they arrived at the secluded estate.


It wasn't very big, but it had an old-fashioned charm and a peaceful feel to it. The place had been built years ago with millions funded by Arabella's father.


Ever since their grandfather's passing, their grandmother had been living there alone.


That day, she sat in the living room, calmly sipping her coffee. Dressed in a refined vintage gown, she carried an air of timeless grace and quiet dignity-nothing like the stern, sharp grandmother Elissa remembered from her childhood.


Back then, their grandmother had been fierce, the type who never let anything slide.


But over the years, after Arabella's father got rich,she started enjoying the finer things in life. Now she looked like a real lady of status.


"Mom!" Meagan rushed toward her.


Vanessa Stanley frowned and spoke sharply.
"Have you forgotten everything I raised you to know,Meagan?"


Meagan paused, trying not to roll her eyes. Her mother had always valued appearances above all else. So she cut to the chase. "Mom, Arabella took the villa, and now our company's going under!"


Vanessa's hand shook, and her coffee cup almost fell. "What? I thought that girl ran away from home!"


"She came back," Meagan hissed. "And she's been tormenting us ever since!"


As Elissa and Khloe added their complaints,Vanessa got so worked up she slammed her cup down and started shouting angrily.






That night, Arabella woke up and went back to work at the restaurant.


She had been rushing between tasks nonstop lately, and Asher had been her steady driver the entire time.


Joshua had once said, "I think Asher's really thoughtful."
Arabella didn't reply. She looked at Asher now,sitting on the sofa, deep into his work. He looked so focused-it was kind of attractive, actually.


Still, it couldn't be easy for him to get work done here instead of the office.


She walked over and offered him a slice of her new chocolate cake. "Try this."


Asher took a bite straight from her hand, then licked a bit of cream from the side of his mouth.He looked up at her. "It's amazing. Bella, you've really got a gift for desserts."


Her brows drew together. She was clearly caught off guard by the nickname.
###Chapter 89 Grandma Just Called




Asher found Arabella's reaction endearing and chuckled.


She changed the topic. "You should probably get back to the office. I've taken up enough of your time these past days."


He gave her a look, brow lifted, his smile both sly and inviting. "I don't mind. You always work better when you're happy,right?"


She missed the hint. "Why are you in a better mood here at the restaurant?"


"It's because you're here," Asher replied without hesitation.


For a moment, Arabella just stared at him, warmth blooming quietly in her chest. She turned away,hiding her fluster. "I need to get back to work now."


Asher watched her leave, a smile spreading across his lips.


He found her adorable, even if she was completely oblivious to romance.
If he never made a move, she might never notice how he felt.


Even someone as calm as Asher could not help feeling a little nervous. He had a sense this journey would take a while.


By the time Arabella wrapped up her tasks, the sky had already darkened. She strolled toward the strip of parkway not far from the entrance.


A figure ducked behind some shrubbery, but she caught up right away.


Facing the trembling paparazzo, Arabella smiled with mischief. "No need to be afraid. I just want you to pass on a message."


"W-what kind of message?" the paparazzo stammered, surprised by how intimidating this young woman could be.


***




Ten minutes later, inside the sleek office of Bob's Cuisine, the paparazzo stood before Bob and relayed the story word for word.


"That's all she said. She told you to quit the games. If you have that much free time, you should start getting ready to close your place early."
Bob's anger boiled over. "That woman has no idea how out of her depth she is! I've kept this restaurant running for five years. She just arrived -does she really believe she's a match for me?So full of herself!"


He stuck out his hand. "Hand over today's footage."


Cash changed hands as the paparazzo surrendered the video. Before slipping away, he added, "Honestly, sir, I think I'm done. That lady is kind of terrifying."


Bob brushed him off with a wave. "That's fine.They're opening soon anyway-we don't need you around!"


In his eyes, the chef was always the heart of a restaurant, and he had already gotten what he wanted.



He knew Arabella's kitchen staff was impressive,but he refused to see it as enough.


His own restaurant boasted Michelin three-star chefs!


From where he stood, Arabella had already lost the battle.


Confidence surged through him.
But then his eyes fell on something in the secretly recorded footage-a figure he recognized.


"Is that Asher?"


He told himself it couldn't be true.


Bob zoomed in. Although the man's face was not fully visible, his presence was unmistakable.Unease crept in. Bob hurried through more of the footage, noticing that same man appeared in nearly every clip.


A split second later, Bob zeroed in on the cufflinks.


It was definitely Asher.


The realization made a cold sweat break out across his skin, quickly giving way to fresh anger.He slammed his fist down on the table.


So Arabella had gotten close to Asher?


Was that the real reason Asher wouldn't commit to Rosie?


Arabella was unbelievable! How could she stoop so low?


Bob wasted no time. He grabbed his phone and called Rosie. "You will not believe what I just
uncovered!"


After sending the paparazzo on his way, Arabella returned home with Asher. Daisy paced the living room, looking visibly nervous.


Arabella went to her side and took her hand."Daisy, what's wrong?"


Without missing a beat, Daisy answered,"Grandma just called. She wants us to visit her."


Right away, Arabella knew what that meant. Any call from Vanessa rarely brought anything good.


Since Arabella's parents died, Vanessa had never shown an ounce of care for them, acting as if they were total strangers. Now that Arabella knew her father was adopted, it mnade more sense to her.



Daisy turned to Arabella, uncertain. "Do you think we should go?"


Arabella kept her voice gentle. "What do you want to do?"



Daisy hesitated, biting her lip. "Even if we refuse,if Grandma wants to find us, she'll track us down sooner or later."


"That's true. Besides, I actually want to see what she's plotting this time," Arabella replied, her tone
turning cold.


Asher chimed in, "Let me drive you both."


Daisy gave him a look, realizing how he had been driving Arabella everywhere lately, and she felt a touch of relief.


The Stanley family's estate sat on the edge of the city. They spent an hour on the road before pulling up to the gate.


Inside, Vanessa and Meagan's family were already having dinner, and the mood at the table looked almost cheerful.


The moment Arabella and Daisy entered, Elissa's eyes flickered with malice.


Vanessa saw them, but she pretended not to notice and went on eating.


Arabella led Daisy straight over, sat herself in Vanessa's chair, and began brewing coffee without a word.


That was all it took for Vanessa to break her composure. "Arabella, Daisy, it's been years,and now you just waltz in and start making coffee without saying hello? Have you forgotten your manners?"
With a cold look, Arabella retorted, "So you do remember it's been years. For a while, I thought S you'd wiped us from your memory."


A flicker of discomfort crossed Vanessa's face,but she pressed on, softening her tone. "Don't be silly. I needed some time for myself, that's all.Now that I'm back, I called for you the first chance I got. Come on, join us for dinner."


Arabella eyed the leftovers piled on the table.Vanessa sure was bold.



She gave a polite, insincere smile. "No, thank you.Dad always said it's rude to join a meal that's already started."
###Chapter 90 Give The House To Meagan!





Vanessa felt thoroughly humiliated by Arabella's sharp tongue, yet, frustratingly, she couldn't find any real fault to argue with.


"It's been a while, Arabella. You seem to be doing quite well," Vanessa said stiffly, pushing aside her half-eaten meal and sitting down beside the sofa.


Arabella gave her a faint smile, laced with mockery. "We're surviving, thanks to Aunt Meagan's overflowing kindness."


Meagan shot up from her seat, shrieking, "You little bitch! What nonsense are you spewing now?"


Vanessa's expression hardened. "Watch your tone. I heard you snatched the house from Meagan. Have you forgotten we're family? Blood ties don't just disappear. What you've done is heartless. Return the house to her."


Arabella looked genuinely confused. "Snatched the house? Was it even under her name? If I really took something that wasn't mine, why hasn't she
gone to the police?"


Her voice was calm, but every word dripped with biting irony. Vanessa's face twisted in frustration.


"That house was bought by your father," Vanessa said, her voice tightening. "But he's no longer here, and Meagan has cared for you all these years.Why can't you just let her have it?"


"Cared for us?" Arabella gave a short laugh. "You mean Daisy took care of her while she was tormenting Daisy nonstop?"


With that, she tossed a file onto the table-it was Daisy's medical report and her case notes.


Vanessa flipped through the documents, and the more she read, the darker her expression became. With a loud thud, she slammed the papers back in Meagan's direction."What is this?How could you treat Daisy like this?"


"| didn't mean to." Meagan panicked. "She brought it on herself."


"You're her aunt. Couldn't you have shown a little compassion?" Vanessa barked. Her tone sounded angry, but her eyes didn't show much blame.


She then turned back to Arabella, her voice softer. "Arabella, don't worry. Meagan's cleary in
the wrong, and I'll make sure she's punished. But I still believe she didn't mean it. She's watched over you and Daisy for years, anyway. Can't you just let her have the house?"


Arabella leaned back into the sofa and said firmly,"No."



Vanessa looked shocked. "Arabella! Are you really going to disobey your family like this?"


"I'm sorry, Grandma. But if standing up for myself means going against you, then yes-because you're trying to take something that belongs to me," Arabella replied coldly.


Vanessa didn't expect such a direct reply and looked furious. "We're your family! What rights or property are you even talking about? I'm giving you one last chance.Give the house to Meagan!"


Arabella's tone remained calm. "No."


Vanessa was so furious that her chest began to tighten painfully. She clutched it instinctively,and in the next moment, her knees gave out and she collapsed to the floor.


Elissa rushed over and bent down to check on her, glaring up at Arabella. "How could you say that to your own grandmother? You're so
ungrateful!"


Arabella looked down at Vanessa. "My father gave you more than enough. This house included.Please know your limits. If you keep trying to take what doesn't belong to you, l'll take back everything my father gave-in his name."


Her words only made Vanessa more furious. She slowly got up from the floor with rage burning in her eyes. "Your father owed everything to us!Without our help, he would've died on the streets.Don't forget that he was adopted by me! He wasn't even my real son!"


Arabella narrowed her eyes, a bit stunned that Vanessa had actually said it out loud.



Daisy, on the other hand, stood frozen. "Dad...wasn't born into the Stanley family?"


Vanessa's expression darkened with spite as she continued, "Years ago, during a snowstorm, I saw a car slow down and toss something by the roadside. I went to check, and it was a baby,nearly frozen to death. If I hadn't stepped in, he wouldn't have made it through the night. Even though we were barely getting by back then, I still took him in. I gave him food and shelter and raised him like my own."
She locked eyes with Arabella. "So now do you understand,Arabella?


If it weren't for me, your father wouldn't have existed, and without him, there'd be no you! So everything you are, everything you have... it all belongs to me!"


Arabella slowly lowered her head. "So... that's the truth?"


Vanessa raised her chin, proud and certain."Exactly. Now tell me-do you still have the nerve to say that house is yours?"


Arabella said nothing. She just sat there quietly,not giving away a single emotion.


Vanessa softened her tone, mixing sympathy with pressure. "I know this is a lot to take in. But think carefully. We're the only family you've got.Without us, you and Daisy really have no one else in this world."


Seeing both sisters still in shock, Vanessa took the chance to get up. "You two stay here and think it over. I'm going for a walk with Meagan."


She left the room, hoping the silence would be enough to make Arabella change her mind.


As soon as they left, Daisy turned to her. "Do you
think it's true? That Dad wasn't Grandma's biological son?"


"Her attitude makes it pretty clear," Arabella responded, lifting her head. "But no. I don't believe the story she told. I don't think Dad was just some baby she found in the snow."


"Exactly! She's always been stingy. Why would she take in a stranger's child for no reason?"Daisy's hands balled into fists. "Let's just leave.There's no way we're giving her anything Dad left behind!"


Arabella nodded slowly. "We will.But not just yet."Her voice turned sharp, her eyes steady. "I want to find out the real reason she took Dad in."


Just as Arabella had guessed, after dropping the truth, Vanessa thought she was being smart-thinking that dropping a shocking truth and walking away would give them time to regret everything.


But she didn't know Arabella well enough. She couldn't be tricked that easily.


Arabella stood up and led Daisy upstairs.


Their father had bought this house long before they were born.
There had to be something left behind or some clue that could tell them what really happened.
###Chapter 91| Wish They'd Never Been Born!





Arabella and Daisy started searching every inch of the house.


After some time, their efforts turned up nothing.Frustration creased Arabella's brow. Had her father really left no trace behind?


She wandered back into his old room, eyes landing on the bookshelf coated in dust. Her hand reached out instinctively as she recalled how her father used to read books in this very spot, long before he ever dreamed of founding his own company.


But as Arabella's fingers skimmed the surface,she felt something off.


Though it looked like plain wood, the material beneath was solid, almost like it was reinforced with something bulletproof.


What kind of bookshelf needed that kind of protection?


Arabella immediately began inspecting every inch. Seeing her intensity, Daisy joined in to help.
It wasn't long before Arabella's hand found a spot that felt out of place, a possible switch. She pressed it.


Suddenly, a faint click broke the silence, and the bookshelf began to turn.


A hidden passageway appeared.


Excitement sparked between Arabella and Daisy.


They headed straight in, lighting their way with their phones, and soon found themselves in a basement filled with all sorts of unfamiliar equipment.


Daisy's eyes widened. "What is all this?"


Daisy looked completely lost, but Arabella recognized every piece.


These were the same devices she used in her lab.



Discovering such advanced technology in her father's basement left Arabella completely stunned. "We need to find anything my dad left behind. We don't have much time before Vanessa comes back."


They quickly uncovered a stack of his books.
With no time to examine them, they hurried back downstairs.


Vanessa and Meagan returned from her walk.



"You know, the older you get, the more important it is to take a stroll after meals. Otherwise, your food just sits there," Vanessa said cheerfully.


Meagan poured on the praise. "Mom, you're doing better than anyone your age. Those older women out in the countryside have nothing on you!"


"Please, don't lump me in with the likes of them,"Vanessa sneered, her gaze sharp with cunning."I'm certain Arabella and Daisy have already come around."


They moved into the living room, and sure enough, found Arabella and Daisy standing there with downcast eyes, looking appropriately remorseful.


Meagan's heart swelled with satisfaction. At last,these two little rebels were acting properly.


Vanessa settled into the sofa and asked, "So,how did everything turn out?"
Arabella replied calmly, "Grandma, I think your reasoning makes a lot of sense."


A pleased smile appeared on Vanessa's lips. "You really are the most sensible one, Arabella."


"But since my father wasn't actually your son,shouldn't this house go back to us? All those years, my dad supported you financially. That should be more than enough repayment for raising him." Arabella lifted her chin, her face giving nothing away.


The words hit Vanessa like a slap. She stared at Arabella, completely stunned. "What did you just say?"


"You were just a country woman before my father gave you this house. If he wasn't your real son,isn't it only fair that you give us back what belongs to him?" Arabella answered, her tone flat,almost cold.


Vanessa never expected this kind of defiance and was shaking with anger. "How dare you talk to me like that, you ungrateful girl?"


Meagan jumped in, voice rising, "Are you out of your mind, Arabella? If it wasn't for my mom, your
dad would have already dead!"


"Without my father, you'd still be stuck working in an electronics factory, isn't that right?" Arabella let out a quiet, mocking laugh as she looked at Meagan. "Without him, your whole family would be living the country life you claim to hate. So really, who's come out ahead here?"


"You-" Vanessa was so furious she could barely catch her breath. Meagan rushed to give her some medicine.


Meanwhile, Arabella and Daisy rose from their seats. Arabella said, "Grandma, you can stop buying that cheap coffee to act sophisticated. It tastes awful, and you clearly have no clue about quality."


With that, she and Daisy took their leave.


That jab nearly sent Vanessa over the edge.


Once she regained her composure, Vanessa swore. "Ungrateful brats! I wish they'd never been born!"


"Mom, I keep telling you, those two are a lost cause." Meagan added as she tried to soothe her,
"But what if Arabella refuses to hand over the house?"


Elissa, speaking quietly, said, "Honestly, I think Arabella's already crossed a line she can't come back from."


Meagan shot her a look. "What are you getting at?"



Elissa explained, "Nobody has patience for disrespectful children anymore. Arabella's only making things worse for herself."


Khloe jumped in, her tone bright. "Exactly! Now we get to keep the house and don't owe a dime! lt was always meant to be ours!"


Now that she knew Arabella's father wasn't related by blood, Khloe felt a sudden confidence.


She pictured herself breezing through her next live stream, without a trace of worry about being called out.


That smug feeling lasted until her hand brushed the scars on her face, her mood instantly soured.
Back at the Gracebourne house, Arabella and Daisy wasted no time digging into their father's notebooks.


Asher had already left for work.


Page by page, their father's words painted a vivid picture. His nagging doubts about his true background, right up until the moment he learned he wasn't related to the Stanley family.


The notes went on to describe the moment everything changed between him and their grandparents.


In one entry, he wrote. "I want to marry Sylvia Herington. She's a good person, strong and principled, just like me. But my parents refuse to accept her and keep pushing Nora Royale. I won't back down. After marrying Sylvia, their disapproval only grew. Eventually, we moved out."
###Chapter 92 You Can't Start Dating Asher This Soon!





This was the moment when everything shifted between their father and his parents.


But what had driven their grandparents to push so hard for him to marry Nora? And who was Nora,really?


Arabella couldn't shake the feeling that there was a bigger story, so she reached out to Joshua for help digging deeper.


She and Daisy kept turning the pages.


The next few diary entries were filled with their father's joy at their arrival and described how life moved along quietly for a while. Then came a long gap, an entire month with no writing at all.


When the diary picked up again, the words were heavy. "I never thought I'd learn that Sylvia was actually... Fate really does play tricks! What am l supposed to do now? What about the kids? I need to be ready. My situation doesn't matter, but the children are still so little-it's heartbreaking.I'm sorry to all of you."
That was where the diary ended.


Whatever came after "Sylvia was actually..." had been completely blacked out, hiding the truth from them.



When Daisy finished reading, her eyes filled with tears. "Do you think Dad knew the end was coming?"


"It seems like it. And Mom must be important,"Arabella said,her mind racing.



"Do you think someone wanted them dead?"Daisy asked, worry coloring her tone.


Arabella's voice dropped. "That's what it looks like."



At that moment, Joshua replied with the information he had dug up. Tracing Nora's identity had been simple. She turned out to be the daughter of a distant branch of Arabella's grandfather, and about the same age as their dad.


But Arabella was left wondering. Why had her grandfather been so insistent? Nora seemed perfectly unremarkable, while their own mother had been extraordinary-gentle, strong,everything anyone could admire.
"Grandma must have known who Dad really was,"Arabella said coldly. "There's no other reason for them to break up his marriage just to pair him with Nora."


Daisy glanced at the message on Arabella's screen. "That means Dad's background is a big deal too... but we're totally in the dark."


Arabella thought for a moment. "If anyone knows the truth, it's probably Grandma."


Right then, a new message popped up. "How's it going,Bella? Want any help?"


"Bella?!" Daisy exclaimed, her eyes going wide.


Flustered, Arabella's cheeks turned red. "It's just a nickname, that's all."


Immediately, Daisy clung to Arabella's hand. "You can't start dating Asher this soon!"


Arabella sighed, then changed the subject."Anyway, I'll talk to Asher. His dad knew ours-maybe he can help us find something."


Daisy agreed with a nod.


Arabella headed for the study and filled Asher in on what she had found in the diary, deciding there was no reason to keep secrets anymore.
In her mind, he was on her side.


Asher spoke thoughtfully. "I remember my father mentioning yours once. He said your dad never belonged in that family, but I didn't press him for details."


His expression darkened, and his tone grew heavy. "Both of our fathers died so abruptly."


Arabella hesitated, then asked gently, "Can I ask   11



Asher continued, "My father carried a bullet from the war. The doctors said taking it out would kill him, but living with it caused him endless pain. In the end, he couldn't hold on and passed away just a few months after your father. Those last months, his mind was fading. Otherwise, I know he would have tried to get in touch with you."


Though Asher's face remained calm, there was a note of sadness in his voice.


At the time, he had been stationed with the military and only managed one final visit before his father was gone.


Arabella reached for his hands, her touch gentle and comforting.


His skin was cool to the touch.
Taken aback, Asher noticed how her gentle warmth seeped into his skin, and he instinctively gave her hands a reassuring squeeze. In that silent exchange, the two of them found complete understanding.


A steely determination settled in Arabella's eyes."I will find out who's responsible for my parents'deaths."


"You're not alone. I'll help you every step of the way," Asher assured her, his gaze unwavering.Suddenly, a thought struck him. "Your mother's maiden name is Herington, isn't it?"


"It is. Why?" Arabella answered.


"The Herington family in Ockford are shrouded in mystery. They aren't counted among the city's richest, but almost every member holds some position in government or wields serious influence. Even the top elite families can't match their power," Asher said with a frown.


Arabella nodded slowly. She had heard whispers about the Herington family, but rarely crossed paths with them as they always seemed to move in different circles.


Could it be possible that her mother had ties to Herington family?
It was clear she would need to make a trip to Ockford if she wanted answers.


"You should get some rest," Asher told her gently,his usually frosty gaze warmed by concern.


Arabella nodded in agreement. "You too, Asher.Don't push yourself."


She started to head for the door, but Asher's hands lingered, refusing to let her go right away.Only after a gentle tug did she manage to slip free.


Leaving the study, she couldn't help the small smile that crept onto her lips. Until she nearly bumped into Daisy waiting in the hallway."Daisy?"


"Can I stay in your room tonight?" Daisy asked as she looked up, with hope shining in her eyes.


Arabella's answer came without hesitation."Absolutely."


Daisy's grin was so bright as she latched onto Arabella's arm. "I knew you wouldn't say no."


But as they walked away, Daisy's cheerful mask slipped for just a second, her expression clouded with frustration.
Seriously? Bellawas smiling jusi becauseC Asher? That was so irritating!


A few days later Arabella fianlly opened her restaurant.narming it Avalon



Opening day was a huge success, with plenty of guests streaming in for a look.


Arabella moved through the space, making sure every detail was perfect.


That was when she caught sight of Rosie by the window.
###Chapter 93 Are You Afraid I'll Take His Customers





Rosie was wearing a long white satin gown that shimmered softly under the light, making her look effortlessly elegant. She exuded the calm confidence and grace of a true lady from a respected family.


Several guests found themselves sneaking glances at her, captivated by her poised and polished presence.


Sitting across from Rosie was a younger woman,laughing and chatting with her. But Arabella soon noticed something-Rosie's smile didn't quite reach her eyes. Her tone was distant, her posture composed but cold. There was a quiet pride in the way she carried herself, as if keeping everyone at arm's length.


That subtle aloofness caught Arabella's eye,making her watch them more closely.


As a waiter passed wvith plates in hand, the younger woman stuck out her foot, clearly trying to trip him.
Arabella stepped in quickly. "I've got this," she said, intercepting the waiter and steering him away before anything happened.


Frustrated at being stopped, the young woman quietly pulled her foot back.


But Arabella could tell-they weren't done yet.


Moments later, the sharp crash of a shattered plate startled the room. The young woman-Raven Russell-suddenly doubled over, gagging dramatically. Rosie leaned forward with a look of concern. "What's wrong, Raven?" she asked.


"I feel terrible! The food here is filthy! I'm allergic to anything unhygienic!" Raven cried out dramatically, still gagging as if the very thought made her sick.


Rosie was furious. "How did this happen? Go get the boss now!"


A staff member rushed to find Arabella. She arrived quickly, took in the scene with steady eyes, and asked in a composed voice, "Can someone explain what's happening here?"


One look at Arabella's calm, youthful beauty, and Rosie felt a spark of jealousy. So this was the woman Asher cared for? She was younger,sure-
but aside from that, Rosie didn't see what made her so special.


"Isn't it obvious?" Rosie said coldly. "She ate your food, and now she's vomiting!"


That comment stirred unease among the nearby diners.


"Bad hygiene on the very first day?"


"This is seriously concerning."


"I liked the food, but if it's not clean, that's a huge problem."


Hearing the murmurs ripple through the room,Rosie knew they were getting exactly the reaction they wanted. She fixed her gaze on Arabella and asked icily, "So what are you going to do about this?"


Rosie figured Arabella was just a spoiled girl riding on Asher's support, with no real idea how to run a place. Faced with a public mess like this,she must be panicking inside, right?


Surprisingly,though, Arabella remained calm. "I'm sorry you feel that way, but our kitchen is kept spotless. You're more than welcome to check it yourself," she said politely.
Then, turning to the manager, she added, "If any customers want to see the kitchen, take them in."


Hearing her words, a few curious customers took her up on the offer and went to see the kitchen for themselves.


When they came back, they looked genuinely shocked.


"Honestly, their kitchen's cleaner than my apartment!" one whispered.


"Right? There's no way this place has hygiene issues," another added.


"Something doesn't add up here."


Raven shot Arabella a glare. "Maybe you just cleaned everything up before we got there! Ugh! I feel awful. You've totally ruined me! I'm never stepping foot in this place again!"


"Is this how you handle problems? Just make excuses and avoid accountability? Pathetic. If that's the case, we're done here, and we won't be coming back," Rosie said sharply as she grabbed Raven's arm to leave.


Her words held weight.


A few customers looked at each other, and those
who recognized Rosie whispered, "If Miss Hudson doesn't like this place, maybe we shouldn't come again either."


"Yeah,better to be safe."


Arabella remained calm as she watched them stand up. But just as Raven passed by, Arabella swiftly reached out and grabbed her wrist.


"What are you doing?" Raven snapped, her voice hoarse between exaggerated gags.


Arabella released her and said quiety,"Emetics?Clever little setup."


Raven froze for a split second, then composed herself. "I have no clue what you're accusing me of. This place is a dump and I'm not coming back anyway!"


"I just hope you didn't sneak that medicine into anyone else's food," Arabella said with a faint smile. "How childish of you-taking emetics before showing up, then pretending to get food poisoning. That's your big plan?"


She paused, her tone light but sharp. "Rosie, it looks like you're going out of your way to protect your relative Bob's restaurant. Are you afraid I'll take his customers?"
Rosie's chest tightened. How did she know all that?


All she had done was lightly touch Raven's wrist-how could she possibly tell what kind of drug Raven had taken?


They had used a vomiting agent and showed up solely to sabotage Arabella's restaurant.


Rosie kept her expression cool. "I don't know what nonsense you're spouting. Don't slander us.And since you won't own up, there's no point in staying."


Rosie grabbed Raven's arm and quickly made for the exit, but Arabella's voice cut through the room-clear and firm. "There's a hospital right next door. Let's get both of you checked out. If it turns out you didn't take emetics, I'll do whatever you want. But if you did... you apologize to us,publicly."


Her confidence started shifting public opinion.


"Wait a second... did they really come just to stir up trouble? They look elegant, but this is something else."


"Hey, isn't that one of them Bob Hudson's cousin? That explains a lot."
"Shh-careful! Do you know who you're talking about?"


Rosie could feel the mood turning against her,and her hands balled into fists. She hadn't expected Arabella to be this quick-witted.


To her, Arabella was just a naïve girl trying to play in the big leagues.



Rosie wasn't used to being challenged like this,especially not by someone without real influence.In her world, facts could be twisted, and evidence could be erased.


No matter how obvious Raven's little act was, she believed Arabella wouldn't stand a chance. After all, her family's power could easily silence the truth.



Rosie raised her chin with quiet confidence,her eyes meeting Arabella's with a cool, unreadable look. "And why exactly should I care about what you say? Do you really think you're bold enough to go up against my family?"


With a slow, contemptuous smile, she added,"You really make it hard to like you. Let me make this clear-anyone who dines here, your family included, is now blacklisted from doing any business with us."
###Chapter 94 Your Food Is Incredible




The air in the restaurant felt heavy with tension.



Arabella's place was a fancy, upscale spot, and it happened to be Bob's biggest rival.


Most of the customers here were rich and influential.



Even if some of them didn't personally deal with the Hudson family, there was always the risk that a friend or relative might. Rosie knew what she was doing. Just one calculated threat from her could jeopardize Arabella's entire future in this business.


After thinking it through, most guests decided it was safer not to return.


It was unfortunate for Arabella, but people thought she had asked for it by upsetting the Hudsons-one of the richest families in Ockford.


Rosie kept her eyes on Arabella, expecting her to panic or show some remorse.


But Arabella only gave a slight smile and said calmly, "Must be nice being a Hudson-say a few
words and suddenly you think you can get away with anything."


Rosie's lips curled. "Whatever," she snapped,then turned and strode out with Raven still clinging to her side.


As soon as they stepped outside, Raven, still coughing dramatically, leaned in and said smugly,"After that little performance? There's no way anyone will dare step foot in that place again.That woman's got no clue who she's dealing with!"


That was the kind of power the Hudsons held-no one dared to challenge them.


And yet Rosie didn't look satisfied. She wasn't smiling. This entire situation had been beneath her.


If it weren't for Asher, she wouldn't have wasted her time on this place. Her jaw tightened in frustration.


Just then, Raven gasped and tugged her arm."Rosie...look!"


She held out her phone, her eyes wide.


On the screen was a post by none other than Felix Saville-a top-tier celebrity with millions of
followers. He had uploaded a picture from inside Avalon, along with a caption that read, "Beautiful.Delicious. Loved it."


A single post from Felix was enough to send his entire fan base into a frenzy.


People nearby who had seen the tweet in real time lit up with excitement. "This is it! This is the place Felix just posted about!"


"It looks so classy! If he came here, I want to try it too!"



The floodgates burst open. Crowds began pouring into the restaurant, eager to eat at the same spot their idol had just praised.


Rosie's face darkened instantly.


Why on earth would Felix publicly support Arabella's restaurant?


Just then, her phone buzzed again. She glanced down and her blood ran cold. She had been following Asher on Twitter, and he rarely posted anything personal. But now, he had shared a picture of a restaurant.


Just from the dishes shown, Rosie knew it was Avalon.
The caption was simple. "Quite impressive."


Rage bubbled up inside Rosie. She was about to lose it.


Asher was actually here? Had he seen everything?


Panic kicked in, and her eyes shot up-there he was, standing by the floor-to-ceiling window on the second floor.


He was looking down like a king watching over his land. Their eyes locked, and his gaze was cold and sharp under the sun.


Her breath caught in her throat, and for a moment, the world seemed to tilt.


Asher clearly knew she had come here to make trouble for Arabella.


She had worked hard to seem refined and graceful in front of Asher, certain she stood out from the rest-someone worthy of him. But now,the very first time she tried to scheme, he had caught her red-handed.


She wanted to run and hide. But after Asher's public praise, the public would clearly side with the Gordons over the Hudsons. If Arabella's restaurant kept thriving, the Hudson name would
take a serious hit.


All that pride and posturing? It had completely backfired on her.


Frustrated, Rosie bit her lip and dragged herself back into the restaurant, where customers were now whispering excitedly.


"Wait... was that really Asher up there?"


"Mr. Gordon actually recommended this place!That's huge! Is he somehow connected to the owner?"


"Who cares if he is? I'm definitely coming back.Maybe we'll get to see him again!"


The energy had shifted completely. No one seemed to remember Rosie's earlier threats.Feeling the sting of embarrassment, she forced a smile. "I'm sorry for what I said earlier. Today's meal is on me-please don't take anything to heart."


The crowd stayed silent. No one responded.Humiliated,Rosie turned and walked out.


The moment she got into the car, the tears came rushing out.


Raven glanced at her and tried to help. "Did you
really have to pick a fight with this place? Was it because of Bob?"


Rosie shut her eyes, her voice low. "That's enough. Just drive."


Raven didn't press. Rosie's silence said it all.


Though they were technically cousins, their relationship wasn't close.


Most of the extended family lived off the Hudson name, which was why Raven had even bothered showing up today-to back Rosie up.


Upstairs, Arabella finally had a moment to respond to Felix's text now that the chaos had passed.


Felix replied, "It's the least I could do. No need to thank me."


Arabella typed back, "Still. Thank you."



She then stepped into the VIP room, where Asher and Colton were already eating. Colton lit up the moment he saw her. "Your food is incredible, Miss Stanley! Not like that fancy-looking but flavorless food at Bob's Cuisine!"


In his eyes, the two restaurants weren't even comparable.
The only reason Bob's place was still holding on was because of the Hudson family's support.


Without that backing, hardly anyone would choose to eat there.


"Thanks. Eat as much as you like," Arabella said kindly.


She noticed Colton fumbling with the wrapping of the signature dish and stepped in to help, quickly making one for him.


Colton took it with a grateful smile. "This tastes amazing," he said happily, then glanced at Asher."Miss Stanley's cooking really is on another level."


The moment he met Asher's icystare, his smile faded, and he almost choked on his words.


Asher turned to Arabella. "Make one for me too."


His tone was even, his face unreadable, but there was a subtle flash of jealousy in his eyes that didn't go unnoticed.


Arabella gave a small sigh."Fine."


She made one quickly and handed it to him.


Asher took a bite right fom her hand, his lips grazing her fingertips. Her hand trembled slightly
at the touch.


Colton sat there in silence, awkwardly aware he was now the third wheel.


However, it finally made sense to him-why Rosie had come after Arabella earlier.


He had seen the whole scene play out downstairs with his own eyes.


"You two carry on," Arabella said with a smile."I've got to check on things outside."


It was still opening day, after all.


The second she was gone, Colton leaned closer to Asher. "Be honest. Have you fallen for her?"
###Chapter 95 Daisy's In Trouble!




"I have," Asher answered right away.



Colton said, "I'll admit, Miss Stanley is impressive,but don't underestimate the Hudson family. If you walk away from Rosie this easily, they might not let it go."


Asher responded in a steady, commanding tone,"And what if they don't? What couldthey possibly do?"


Colton fell quiet. The truth was, the Hudson family couldn't compete with the Gordons.


Still, he couldn't shake the thought that it was a bold move to fall out with them so openly.


Turning the tables, Asher asked, "And what about you? Hasn't your grandmother been pushing you lately?"


Colton's smile faded for a moment.


Without warning, an image of a young, gentle girl flickered in his mind.


He forced the thought away and replied with a shrug, "I'm not rushing to get married."
Later that day, Arabella needed to pick Daisy up in the evening.


Along the way, she crossed paths with Karlie.


At the sight of two identical Daisys, Karlie stared in surprise, but she recovered quickly. "You must be Arabella!"


Arabella nodded. "Looks like Daisy filled you in."


Karlie grinned. "The resemblance is obvious. You and Daisy really are twins!"


A soft smile touched Arabella's lips. "Good observation.How have you been holding up?"


The question made Karlie look down.


The performance was drawing closer, and despite Arabella's promise about a full-time spot, nothing had changed yet.


Karlie had been practicing until late every night before heading home.


"Nothing's different," Karlie said quietly.


Arabella squeezed her shoulder gently. "I meant what I told you. Be patient-I'll keep my promise."


For a second, Karlie studied her, then nodded with resolve.
She already knew what the twins had been through and felt that Arabella was someone she could trust.


Afterward, Daisy and Arabella got in the car to head home. Daisy filled the ride with stories about her day while Arabella listened, lost in thought,until the car rolled to a stop.


Daisy watched Asher step out of the car,confused.


He came back a few minutes later, holding a custom cake in his hands.


Arabella spotted the bakery's logo and her eyes widened. "Jen's Bakery... Aren't their products always booked solid for weeks?"


Asher handed her the box. "I don't need a reservation. You've been busy all day, so try some cake first. Dinner's waiting at home, too." His voice grew gentler as he spoke.


A faint smile touched Arabella's lips. "Thank you."


Daisy pulled a face for a second, but quickly asked, "How did it go today? Was it a big hit?saw Felix posting about your restaurant. You actually know him?"


"Something like that," Arabella answered.
Daisy's eyes sparkled. "Is he as cute in person as he seems online?"


"He's cute," Arabella said.


Daisy was relentless. "But is he as handsome as Asher?"



The steering wheel creaked under Asher's grip.


Arabella replied from the back, sounding cool and unbothered, "They have their own styles."


Daisy let out a laugh. "So, whose style do you like more?"


Asher's knuckles tightened again. He was silent but hanging on her answer.


He wanted to know the truth as much as anyone.


Arabella hesitated, thinking over her response-then Asher interjected, "You should eat your cake before it gets too soft."


With that, the topic shifted, and Arabella exhaled softly, glad for the interruption. She tried a bite,and the cake really did melt on her tongue, sweet and light.


Asher eased up a little, keeping his eyes on the road, but sweat still clung to his palms.
He had never imagined a girl would take up so much space in his thoughts.


Later, after they finished a good meal to her place, Arabella spoke to Asher. "Our chefs have everything running smoothly now. Shouldn't your mother's chefs head back to her place?"


Asher kept his tone calm. "No rush. Let them stay at the restaurant for a while."


Arabella looked at him curiously. "Won't your mom need her chefs back?"


He stayed unruffled. "She's fine. She is on diet food anyway."


Arabella blinked in surprise. She always thought wealthy families never worried about gaining weight. After all, none of them ever seemed out of shape.


Over at the Gordon family's mansion, Cecily stared down at her dinner, her appetite nowhere to be found.


She murmured to herself, "When are the chefs coming home?"


She lost interest in her food, pulled out her phone,and scrolled through social media. Right away,she spotted a Twitter post from her son, Asher,
advertising a new restaurant.


Could this restaurant belong to Asher? Cecily's curiosity spiked right away. If she came here, she could finally eat real food again and show her support for Asher's venture at the same time.


By eleven the next morning, Cecily was standing at the restaurant entrance.


Taking in the impressive design, she muttered to herself, "Only my son could open a place like this."


Cecily walked in and caught a server talking to a woman. "Boss, everything is nearly set."


"That's wonderful. Make sure every guest is looked after," Arabella answered.


She turned and caught sight of Cecily."Welcome!Will you be dining alone or with others?"


Cecily stopped in her tracks when she saw Arabella's face, startled by the familiarity.


Arabella waited a beat, then asked, "Ma'am, how many are in your party?"


Cecily finally found her voice. "Are you the owner here?"
"Yes, that's right," Arabella answered.


Cecily's expression shifted through several emotions before she answered in an even tone,"Just me."


Arabella gave her a polite nod. "Please follow me."


Cecily settled at her table and ordered severa of the signature dishes, all the while watching Arabella move around the room. The resemblance was almost uncanny.


When her food arrived, Cecily tasted each dish and found every biteboth flavorful and healthy.


It had to be the work of their family's chefs.



Still, Cecily wondered why Asher had sent them here. The reason escaped her.


Maybe... something was going on between Asher and the owner? But she quickly dismissed the idea-it must be business, nothing more.


Cecily couldn't imagine the girl having a deeper connection with Arabella.


Meanwhile, Arabella was busy checking on the staff and making sure the restaurant ran smoothly when her phone rang. Karlie's voice was frantic
on the line. "Arabella, something's happened!
Daisy's in trouble!"
###Chapter 96 You're Expelled From The Troupe




Arabella's eyes narrowed sharply. Without wasting a second, she issued a few quick orders and rushed straight toward the dance troupe.



Over at the Griridge Opera House, the dance studio had erupted into pure chaos. Two groups of dancers were desperately trying to pull Lailah and Daisy apart.


Their hair was messy, their clothes wrinkled,and both had scratches on their faces.



Patrick stormed in after getting the news. He took one look at the scene and barked, "What on earth is going on here?"


"She hit me first!" Lailah snapped, biting her lip in frustration. "Mr. Stone, she actually laid hands on me! This is unacceptable!"


Daisy didn't back down. "That's because she insulted my family first!"


"| didn't insult her family!" Lailah cried in protest."All I said was that her dancing needed work, and she attacked me!" She looked at Patrick with
teary eyes, playing the victim. "If Daisy treats me like this, how am I supposed to lead this team?"


Patrick faced Daisy with a stern expression."Lailah has a point.She's your team leader-how could you hit her? That goes against everything we stand for. You've left me no choice. You're expelled from the troupe."


The studio fell into stunned silence.


Daisy? Expelled-just like that? The news sent a ripple of shock through the studio.


Karlie stepped forward, frowning. "Mr. Stone,don't you think it's too soon to jump to that decision? You haven't even heard the full story."


"Lailah's been here for years." Patrick addressed Daisy. "No matter what, you don't lay a hand on your. If she said something offensive, you should've brought it to our attention, not lashed out. If everyone started throwing punches whenever they were upset, what would happen to society?"


A girl from the substitute team suddenly chimed in, "He's right. No matter what, violence shouldn't be tolerated."


It was Sarah Wells, a curly-haired dancer whose
eyes were practically shining with anticipation.


If Daisy got kicked out, there would be a vacancy in the main lineup, and Sarah just happened to be the most likely candidate to move up.


She could already imagine what it would feel like to be part of the core team.


"Exactly! Violence should never be tolerated,"another dancer added, jumping on the bandwagon.


"Daisy's temper is scary," someone else murmured. "She makes rehearsals stressful for everyone."


Daisy's expression darkened. She turned to Patrick, her voice cold. "If you're going to stand by Lailah no matter what, Mr. Stone, then there's nothing more to say."


Patrick's face twisted with anger. "Watch your tone, Daisy! That's no way to speak to your superior!"


Just as Daisy opened her mouth to reply, a calm and steady voice interrupted. "Apologies, Mr.Stone. Daisy's always been a little blunt. Looks like she accidentally told the truth out loud."
A tall woman stepped into the room, wearing a hat and a face mask. Even with her face mostly covered, her calm and confident presence stood out.


Daisy's eyes lit up. "Bella!" she called out with relief.


Karlie let out a quiet breath, feeling calmer now that Arabella was here.


Arabella always made her feel safe, evenin messy situations like this.


"You must be Daisy's sister," Patrick said sternly."If she's out of line, are you too? Do you even realize what you're doing? This is defamation!"


He paused, then added coldly, "I'll give you one chance to apologize. If not, you're banned from the troupe-permanently."


The room went quiet as all eyes turned to Daisy and Arabella.


The same thought crossed everyone's mind-those two didn't fear a thing.


"I'm telling the truth," Arabella calmly replied.


"Do you have any proof?" Sarah shouted right away, eager to make herself stand out. She saw
this as her moment-if she backed Patrick, maybe she would finally be promoted to a full member.Stepping forward, she challenged boldly, "If you're so confident, then show us the evidence!"


"Okay then," Arabella said as she pulled out her phone.


Patrick watched her quietly, and a strange feeling settled in his chest. What if she really did have proof?


After a tense pause, Patrick forced a strained voice. "Forget it. You're still young. I'll overlook it this once. Just leave."


Arabella gave a small smile, though her eyes stayed cold. "That's not your call to make. It's whether I'm willing to let you off the hook."


A chill ran down Patrick's spine,but he raised his voice to mask it. "I've clearly been too lenient.If you don't appreciate kindness, then fine-security! Get them out of here!"


Sarah rushed forward and grabbed Daisy's arm."Didn't you hear? Mr. Stone said get out!" she barked.


Several other dancers joined Sarah,shoving Daisy toward the door. Karlie stepped in, trying to
intervene. "Stop! You don't even know what really happened!"


Sarah shot Karlie a frosty glare. What an idiot.Didn't she realize this was their shot? If Daisy was out, someone finally got promoted.


Arabella stepped in front of Daisy and stood tall,blocking the substitute members.


Her strong presence made them pause.


Right then, the security guards came in.


"Take these two girls out," Patrick said, glancing at them once more before leaving.


Just then, a voice from a video clip played out loud. "You've got the skills. You think the main team's all that? Lailah? She'd be nothing if it weren't for me."


"What the hell is wrong with you? You don't get to disrespect our leader like that!" someone shouted back.


Trace sneered. "You think Lailah's a big deal? I've lost track of how often she's warmed my bed."


The woman's voice in the video had been muted,but the man's voice came through clearly, and there was no doubt about it.
It was Trace.
###Chapter 97 Makes You Wonder Who's Backing Her




All eyes instantly snapped to Lailah.


Her head spun in disbelief.


"No way! Did our team leader actually do that?"



"I mean, she's always been tight with Trace, but this? Sharing a bed? That's next level."


"Ugh, that's seriously gross."


Murmurs rippled through the room as stares shifted uneasily from one dancer to another.


The substitute members' eyes lit up with hope.


If two full members got kicked out, their own chances of moving up would be much better.


Lailah jolted out of her shock and charged at Arabella in a frenzy. "It's all lies! You conniving bitch-how dare you try to ruin me like this?"


Arabella met her attack with a swift kick. "The clip can be verified. Want to test if it's fake?"


"Even if it's real, he was clearly lying!" Lailah
snapped, her voice rising. "You must've planned this with him to frame me!"


Patrick's gaze darkened. So this was the evidence Arabella had hinted at.


"Lailah's our lead dancer, and this kind of accusation is beyond outrageous," Patrick said coldly. "Forget throwing them out. Call the police.Let them deal with it."


One of the guards didn't hesitate, and he quickly pulled out his phone to call the police.


Lailah let out a quiet breath of relief and glanced at Arabella with a smug look.


But Arabella just gave a calm, amused smile.


Patrick's frown deepened. "What's so funny?"



"You think I came here without evidence?"Arabella chuckled and pulled up another video on her phone.


A flirtatious female voice played from the phone."Do you like it, Trace? I wore this just for you...your little sweetheart."


Trace's voice was full of delight. "No wonder they say dancers are the best-you do know how to make a man happy."
As the video played, several dancers turned their eyes away in discomfort.


It was way too explicit. No one imagined Lailah could be so shameless behind closed doors.


People avoided looking at her, their gazes filled with thinly veiled disgust.


Lailah's confident look disappeared instantly. She stared at the screen in shock, as if the floor had just dropped out from under her. The room went deathly quiet.


With a shriek, Lailah lunged again."Turn that off!You evil witch!" she screamed.


Arabella didn't even flinch-she kicked her off just as coldly as before.


Patrick's face grew stormy.


So Lailah had done it that dirty with Trace! She hadn't caught an STD, had she?


Fury overtook him as he roared, "You're the troupe's leader, and this is how you behave?You've humiliated us all. You're fired-effective immediately!"


"No, I..." Lailah sobbed, struggling to explain, but the words wouldn't come.
Patrick, furious, had already turned and walked away.


"Don't leave yet, Mr. Stone. The show's not over,"Arabella said calmly. "I reported Lailah before,but it was covered up. Makes you wonder who's backing her."


People started connecting the dots, staring at Patrick in shock.


Everyone had thought he was upright and fair.Could he really be involved with Lailah too?


Patrick turned around, looking serious. "I didn't know about that. I'll make sure to investigate it myself."


"Too late. I already found the truth," Arabella replied as she waved her phone.


Patrick froze and quickly said, "Let's talk in private."


Arabella gave a slight nod and followed him.


Inside the office, Patrick looked uneasy. "What kind of proof do you have?" he asked.


After everything that had just happened, he couldn't take chances, even if he didn't want to admit the truth.
"If all goes as expected, this should be enough to get you removed from your position," Arabella said casually, her sharp eyes full of confidence.


Patrick clenched his jaw. "If you want Daisy to stay, fine-she can even be the new team leader.Just drop this now."


Arabella smiled faintly. "Nope. That's not good enough.I want you out of that position."


Patrick's voice rose. "Even if you reveal my relationship with Lailah, we're just dating. Worst case, I'll get a slap on the wrist. Nothing serious!"


Arabella raised a brow. "Oh, I see. So you're dating her? I assumed you were family."


Patrick blinked. "Wait... you have no proof, do you?"


He relaxed for a moment until Arabella added coldly, "You're right, I didn't have any proof earlier. But now I do. Bribing others goes against the association's code of ethics."


Back in the studio, the guards had already escorted Lailah out.


The substitute members looked thrilled,especially Sarah.
She looked at Karlie with a smirk. "No wonder you're still stuck here. You're too soft."


"Still, Daisy didn't do anything wrong," Karlie said,standing her ground.


"You're so naive," Sarah scoffed, rolling her eyes.She kept glancing toward the office door,waiting for Patrick to walk out. But when it finally opened,only Arabella stepped out.


"Where's Mr. Stone?" Sarah asked, looking surprised.


Arabella answered calmly, "He's been dismissed by the association. They also asked me to inform you that Daisy stays. And now that Lailah's out, a substitute will move up."


Everyone stood frozen in shock for a second,then someone asked, "Did they say who gets the spot?"


Arabella gave a short nod. "Yes, they did."


Sarah's heart raced. Was it finally her turn?
###Chapter 98 Mind If We Exchange Contacts





Arabella turned to Karlie and calmly announced,"It's Karlie."


Sarah looked like she had just been slapped with cold water-utterly stunned.


"What? That's impossible! It should've been me!"she burst out, completely unwilling to accept it.


"And what makes you so sure?" Arabella asked with a playful smile.


"Because I'm a good dancer! It should be me! Or are you just siding with Karlie because you two are close?" Sarah shot back stubbornly.


Just then, Jessica walked in. "I heard everything,"she said. "Patrick and Lailah are both officially out. Karlie will be our new team member, and Daisy's taking over as troupe leader."


Karlie and Daisy both blinked in shock before their faces lit up with joy.


Karlie could hardly believe she had really made it onto the team; it felt like she had finally made her
family proud.


Daisy, too, was over the moon about her new leadership role.


Meanwhile,Sarah sulked, clearly unwilling to let it go. "Is that true, Ms. Roman? I've got the most experience.Why Karlie?"


Jessica gave her a chilly look. "'I've been watching. Karlie stays behind to rehearse.You?You clock out the second practice ends."


Sarah's face darkened in frustration.


If she had known there was a real shot, she might have pushed harder-harder than Karlie even.


With the team reshuffled, rehearsal began with fresh energy.


Around three in the afternoon, Jessica clapped her hands and smiled. "Great work today,everyone. Go home early and rest up. Give your best at the show-it's just two days away!"


"Yes, ma'am!" The group echoed cheerfully as they began to pack up and leave.


Karlie clung to Arabella's arm with a grin. "You're amazing! You knew about their affair all along,didn't you?"
Arabella nodded with a soft hum.


"Thank you," Karlie said, her voice fulI of emotion."I never imagined I'd actually make the team. My parents are going to be so proud when they hear the news."


Arabella's eyes softened. "Yes, they'll be proud."


Watching the moment between them, Daisy felt a bit annoyed but she didn't show it. In a pleasant voice, she suggested, "Bella, how about we get something to eat? I'm starting to get hungry!"


"Sure," Arabella nodded. Then she turned to Karlie,"Want to come with us?"


"Absolutely!" Karlie said with excitement.


The trio headed to Avalon, where Arabella ordered the restaurant's signature dishes for them. Karlie was shocked to learn that the elegant, high-end restaurant was actually owned by Arabella. "I had no idea you came from such a wealthy family," she exclaimed.


Arabella gave a small smile. "Something like that.Don't worry,though-everything here's light and healthy."


"This is so good!" Daisy said, smiling. "Your recipes are a hit, Bella."
"Wow, it actually tastes healthy and good!" Karlie said excitedly.


Seeing them enjoy the food made Arabella smile too. It felt like she had just made another true friend.


A short while later, she spotted an unfamiliar face moving around the restaurant and called the manager over. "Is that a new waitress?" she asked.


"Yes, business has picked up lately, so l've brought on more staff," the manager explained."Is something wrong?"


Arabella's eyes followed the young waitress moving efficiently between tables. She seemed capable-quick on her feet and attentive. "No issues," she replied. "Just make sure everything's shut off by eleven, leave only the kitchen running,and prep tomorrow's food."


"Of course," the manager said, though he seemed slightly confused.


Wasn't that part of their usual routine?


Arabella gave a light wave, signaling him to go,and he walked away.


By the time they finished eating, it was barely
past four.


With some unexpected free time on her hands,Arabella decided to treat them to a trip to the amusement park.


Daisy and Karlie, who hadn't been to an amusement park in ages, were bubbling with excitement. Arabella stayed behind, watching them from a nearby bench as they spun on the carousel. Their laughter made her smnile, even if she didn't join in.


As the thought crossed her mind, Arabella pulled out her phone and texted Asher, "Not coming back for dinner."


Asher replied quickly, "Okay. Where are you?"


"With Daisy and Karlie at an amusement park,"she responded.


His answer was short as always, "All right."


He never said much, but he always replied when it came to her.


After Daisy and Karlie finished, they each grabbed one of Arabella's arms, chatting and laughing as they pulled her along. Arabella wasn't used to being around such cheerful energy; it felt new but nice. Then came the invitation. "Come
play with us," they chimed in unison, their eyes sparkling with anticipation.


Arabella smiled but quickly shook her head. "I think I'll pass."


It did look fun, but to her, it felt a little too childish and not quite her thing.


"Have you ever even been on one before?" Karlie asked curiously.


"Not once," she replied.


"Then it's time you try," Daisy grinned. "Let's go on the roller coaster. I'll protect you, Bella!"


Arabella didn't really want to, but against their pleading eyes, she gave in and let them drag her along.


Everyone looked nervous as the roller coaster climbed higher.


Daisy reached out and grabbed Arabella's hand."If you get scared, just squeeze my hand," she said with a reassuring smile.


Arabella gave a quiet nod."Okay."


The roller coaster began its slow climb, then suddenly dropped, sending everyone into a
frenzy. Screams filled the air as Karlie and Daisy shrieked at the top of their lungs.


With every twist and drop, the noise only got louder. Arabella, however, sat still, her face calm despite the chaos.


When the ride finally ended, people staggered off, queasy and breathless. Arabella stepped off like nothing happened.


Holding back her own nausea, Karlie stared at her in disbelief. "Arabella, you're like a robot!" she said.


"A robot?"


"You didn't even flinch!" Karlie exclaimed. "Let's try the haunted house next!"


Arabella was dragged along by the two of them and ended up trying a few more rides, though it was clear she wasn't too eager. Even the ones that were supposed to be thrilling didn't seem to faze her at all.


By the end of it, Karlie and Daisy were buzzing with excitement, laughing and out of breath.Arabella, on the other hand, looked just the same -calm and quiet.


"Isn't there anything you actually enjoy?" Karlie
finally asked.


Daisy glanced at Arabella too, her brows drawn together in concern.


The way Arabella stayed so detached made Daisy wonder-had something happened in her life that left her this numb?


Arabella paused, then realized she didn't really have a favorite thing. Nothing came to mind.


"Don't worry about me," she said. "Go have fun.I've got a few things to check on anyway."


She settled onto a nearby bench.


Seeing that she meant it, Karlie and Daisy let her be and headed off on their own.


As the sun began to set, Arabella sat on the bench, her figure looking a little lonely in the middle of the busy amusement park.


Not far off, someone noticed her and was caught off guard by how striking she looked.


While she was busy looking through some papers for Vanguard Group, a voice suddenly spoke up."Hi, I've been watching you for a while.Mind if we exchange contacts?"
###Chapter 99 Tastes Pretty Good




Arabella glanced up to find a man about her age hovering nearby, clearly nervous and blushing.


Just as she was about to turn him down, a cold,calm voice interrupted out of nowhere. "Mind stepping aside?"


Asher walked over, confident and composed, and sat down beside her. His striking looks and commanding presence were enough to make the man back off immediately. Flustered, the man muttered, "Sorry, I didn't know she had a boyfriend," then quickly left.


Arabella turned to Asher. "Why are you here?"



"I wrapped up some company stuff and thought I'd drop by," he replied, his eyes settling on her."Why aren't you out there enjoying yourself?"


Arabella gave a soft shrug. "It's just not really my thing."


After everything she had been through, things like amusement park rides and crowded games didn't hold the same excitement.
Asher looked at her for a moment, then lightly pinched her cheek. "You're only nineteen. Don't act like life's already worn you out. Try to have some fun."


Arabella rubbed her cheek. "You're one to talk.You've got the same serious vibe."


Asher grinned. "Fair point. Come on, let's take a walk.The view's nice this time of day."


Arabella nodded. The amusement park was glowing in the soft light of dusk. Everything looked warm and dreamy, wrapped in a golden haze. They walked together, their steps slow and easy, until they passed an old man selling cotton candy. "Fresh cotton candy here!" he called out.


"I'll take one," Asher said, stepping forward.


The vendor quickly spun a big, fluffy piece and handed it over.


Arabella raised an eyebrow. "DidIn't know you liked sweet stuff."


Without missing a beat, Asher held it out to her."Try it."


She hesitated. "Sometimes," he said gently, "you just need to enjoy the little things."
That made her stop and think.


Since she started at the national lab, her life had been a whirlwind of pressure and responsibility.


She couldn't even remember the last time she did something so simple and carefree.


She took a bite, and in an instant, her mouth was covered in sugar. Asher laughed quietly and reached out with his long fingers to wipe it away.Then he licked it off his finger like it was no big deal.


"Tastes pretty good," he said with a smug grin.


Her cheeks turned a deep red. She glared at him."You're impossible."


Knowing she didn't like being teased too much,Asher quickly added, "Here, this way's easier."


He pulled off a small piece and fed it to her.


Arabella took a bite and noticed that this way, the sugar didn't stick to her mouth. "Do you eat this a lot?" she asked.


Asher shook his head. "Not really. I usually just see other people eating it."


The truth was, he would never choose something
like this for himself.


"Oh," she said with a small smile, then kept nibbling on the cotton candy.


As evening settled in, the air grew cooler,especially under the shade of the tall trees scattered throughout the park.


Arabella rubbed her arms to keep warm. Just then, a suit jacket gently fell over her shoulders,carrying a warm, familiar scent.


She glanced at Asher. "I'm fine," she said.



"You're not," he replied in a steady voice.


Under the soft glow of the night, Arabella thought Asher looked even more striking. Her heart warmed, and she gently tugged the jacket closer,trying to quiet the sudden swirl of emotion.


"Come on, let's sit for a bit," Asher said, taking her hand and guiding her to a nearby bench.


Just as she sat down, the dark sky exploded with color. Fireworks lit up the air-bright, bold, and beautiful.


People all around the park stopped in awe,snapping photos of the sky.
ed Dilfikea lh surprise. "They do fireworks at night?" she asked.


"Do you like it?" Asher asked, his eyes fixed gently on her.


When Arabella looked up, her eyes met his. There were no fireworks shining in them, only her own reflection. Her heart skipped a beat as a thought suddenly hit her. "Was this all your doing?" she asked softly.


"Yeah," he said softly. "Do you like it?"


"I do," Arabella said with a smile. "But why fireworks?"


"I wanted to surprise you," he replied, his tone warm and sincere.


Arabella went quiet, unsure what to say.


Asher was amused by her troubled look.


Arabella, always composed, looked almost shy and Asher found that side of her incredibly endearing.


Without thinking, he leaned in a little.


Their breaths overlapped. Arabella found herself staring at his face, stunned into silence.
Their faces were so close, it felt like only a breath separated them.


Hey!" A loud voice rang out nearby.


Daisy had been searching for Arabella and just happened to walk in on the moment. Without hesitation, she rushed over and shoved Asher aside. "What do you think you're doing?" she snapped, glaring at him.


Asher stayed calm. "Relax. I was just taking something out of her hair."


And sure enough, he held up a tiny piece of paper.


Daisy let out a breath, but she still looked irritated.


He really has been pushing the limits lately.


Arabella snapped out of it, realizing she had jumped to conclusions.


Karlie came up and spotted Asher. "Wait, is this your boyfriend? He's really cute!"


Before Arabella could say a word, Daisy blurted out,"No! Just friends!"


"Oh, got it," Karlie replied, picking up on the
tension among them.


As the fireworks faded and the night sky returned to calm, the group made their way out of the amusement park, bringing a joyful day to a close.


Back at Avalon, the manager made one last round of checks, just as Arabella had asked, before heading out.


Once he was gone, a shadowy figure slipped into the kitchen. She pulled out a small bag and sprinkled something onto the food. It dissolved instantly, leaving no sign behind.


When she was done, the woman gave a sly,satisfied smile.
###Chapter 100 Did You Replace Your Chefs





The next morning dawned with crystalline clarity,the sky swept clean of yesterday's troubles.


Inside Bob's Cuisine, within the confines of his upstairs office, Bob remained anchored to his chair.


His eyes traced the movements across the street,where Avalon teemed with patrons like bees drawn to honey. Envy gnawed at his chest with relentless persistence.


Before Avalon had emerged from its cocoon, his own establishment had thrived with steady crowds. Now, however, his dining room echoed with the hollow sound of empty tables and scattered conversations.


As he contemplated the storm he had unleashed upon Avalon, satisfaction curved his lips into a predatory smile.


Bob's fingers found his phone and he checked the time with calculated precision. Thirty minutes had melted away, and his carefully orchestrated
plan should now be bearing its poisonous fruit.


The silence shattered as urgent knocking thundered against his door.


"Enter."



The door burst open like a dam breaking, and his assistant stumbled inside, breathless and frantic."Boss-"



Before the words could fully escape, Bob leaned forward with hungry anticipation. "Has something happened at Avalon?"


The assistant's face drained of color, and he stammered through his revelation. "It's not Avalon that's suffering, sir. It's our restaurant. Our customers have been struck with violent diarrhea after their meals. They're forming a desperate line outside the restroom doors, and their anger burns white-hot."


"What?" Bob's world tilted on its axis, and he launched himself from his chair, racing toward the stairs.


Every patron who graced his establishment carried weight in the community. Even the least influential among them possessed considerable means. If he had wounded their dignity, how
could he possibly salvage his reputation?


As Bob descended the staircase, the scene below unfolded like a nightmare. A queue of suffering souls stretched from the restroom entrance, while others hunched over tables, clutching their tortured stomachs as pain twisted their features into masks of agony.


One customer spotted Bob's approach, his face darkening like storm clouds. "Mr. Johnson, was today's cuisine prepared with spoiled ingredients? My stomach has been in rebellion since I finished eating, and l've made countless trips to the restroom."


Another voice joined the chorus of complaint."I've dined here many times before, and the food has always been exceptional. Did you replace your chefs?"


Bob's voice carried false confidence as he attempted to soothe their concerns. "As cherished patrons, you understand our unwavering standards. We have always sourced the finest ingredients available. This must surely be somne terrible misunderstanding."


"Then how do you explain what's happening now?"
"Exactly! So many people are suffering. Are you certain your ingredients meet safety standards?"


An elderly gentleman, his voice measured and grave, spoke with the authority of experience. "I spent decades working in agriculture. This bears all the hallmarks of pesticide contamination causing widespread food poisoning."


Bob's mind reeled with disbelief. His establishment operated with meticulous standards, employing only the most qualified staff. How could such a fundamental oversight have occurred?


More troubling still, this catastrophe should have befallen Avalon, not his own restaurant.


Could it be possible that the calculating Arabella had somehow turned his own weapon against him?


Fighting to contain his rising fury, Bob offered his explanation. "You've all been loyal customers and should remember we've never encountered such difficulties. This must be the work of that shameless establishment across the street.They're consumed with jealousy over our success and have resorted to this underhanded trickery."


"What proof do you have to support such
accusations?" a customer demanded.


Bob's conviction rang hollow as he pressed his case. "I've operated this restaurant for years without a single incident. Now, the moment they open their doors, suddenly we're plagued with problems. If they bear no responsibility for this mess, then who else could possibly be behind it?I'm going to march over there and demand answers!"


Bob stormed toward Avalon, with several curious customers trailing behind him, eager to witness the confrontation that would unfold.


The moment Bob crossed the threshold, the manager stepped forward with professional composure. "Mr. Johnson, is there something troubling you?"


"Summon your boss immediately!" Bob's voice cracked like a whip.


"Is there a specific problem? Perhaps you could explain it to me first."


Bob's patience evaporated entirely. "Stop wasting precious time and bring your boss down here now."


"Of course, everyone please wait just a moment,"
the manager responded with gracious calm before turning to ascend the stairs.


When Arabela descended, she surveyed the scene with the cool assessment of a general evaluating a battlefield. She approached with measured steps, her voice carrying the weight of quiet authority. "Everyone, if you've come to enjoy a meal, you're most welcome. If you've come to create chaos, we have no time for such theatrics."


"Arabella, confess your crimes! Did you sabotage the ingredients at my restaurant? You heartless,calculating woman!" Bob's voice thundered through the space.


This despicable person had dared to strike at his livelihood, and today he would expose her treachery for all to see.


The customers behind him could no longer contain their frustration. One of them snapped at Arabella, "Your personal vendetta is causing us tremendous suffering. You're destroying your own reputation!"


"Mr. Johnson, are you quite certain you've chosen the correct venue for your dramatic accusations?" Arabella's words flowed like silk
over steel, her gaze sweeping across every face in the crowded hall.


Bob's response came loaded with venom, "Are you still maintaining your innocence? My restaurant has operated flawlessly for years. The moment you open Avalon, suddenly pesticide residue contaminates my ingredients. Are you truly claiming you bear no responsibility for this coincidence?"


"Pesticide residue? I've been a patron of Mr.Johnson's establishment before, and the food was always excellent. Did this restaurant's owner really orchestrate something so underhanded?" A customer dining at Avalon couldn't suppress their growing suspicion.


Arabella's laugh carried the sharp edge of bitter irony. "Now I truly grasp the wisdom behind the saying 'the pot calling the kettle black."


Bob's expression transformed instantly,uncertainty flickering across his features. "What exactly are you implying?"


Arabella dismissed his question with elegant indifference and addressed the gathered crowd."Ladies and gentlemen, the equipment and ingredients within these walls represent the
absolute pinnacle of quality. Moreover, I find myself the victim of completely false accusations!"


Bob felt panic clawing at his chest, though he maintained his aggressive facade. "What ridiculous nonsense are you spouting? You're accusing me of orchestrating some elaborate frame job? Do you possess any evidence whatsoever? Without solid proof, these are nothing more than desperate, baseless accusations!"


"Who claimed I lack evidence?" Arabella responded, raising her voice for everyone to hear.
