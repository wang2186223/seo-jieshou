###Chapter 1 The Fake Daughter Loses Everything

Mirs Gibsom. do you have anything to say about youn husband showig up at Mantlee Jenkins' birthday party today and emmouncing that he's going to divorce you?



People are saying Manilee is MM. Gibson's first love and the real daughter of your parents, while you're the fale Youve been enjoying her parents' love all this time and morried to the man meant for her. Do you feel bad about that?"



"Your parents just said you're not really their daughter and cut off your money. You've been out of work for two years, living as a housewife, so how exactly do you plan to support yourself now? Mrs. Gibson, any comments?"



The birthday party was crowded, and Alexia Gibson found herself completely trapped.



Reporters quickly closed in on her, pushing cameras and microphones into her face as camera flashes burst from every direction, giving her no space to breathe



Alexia just stood there, frozen. Her mind was still spinning from everything she'd just heard So this Marilee Jenkins was the real daughter of her so -called parents and her husband's true love.


And her? She was Roger Gibson's wife on paper, but clearly, just a joke to everyone else



Years ago, the Jenkins couple had pulled her out of some run-down neighborhood overseas, saying she was their long-lost daughter.



But had they really not bothered doing a simple DNA test before welcoming her in?



Why did they only discover the mistake now?



Alexia's body tensed up. Her eyes drifted over to the man standing next to her. However, Roger's attention was not on her. He was looking at Marilee, as if they were the only ones in the room.



Her voice came out strained as she asked, "Why? You didn't even tell me."



Roger's face was as cold as stone. "Now you know.That's all that matters. It's over, Alexia. You were never good enough for me. Our marriage? Just a transaction. The only woman I've ever loved is Marilee.And you know why I never touched you after the wedding? Because you disgust me. You're like a spoiled dish-completely unappetizing."
His eyes swept over her from head to toe, full of scorn. Her simple clothes, those outdated glasses-everything about her clashed with the glossy, high-class world he lived in.



Before his harsh words even fully sank in, Alexia lifted her glass and threw the champagne right into his face.



The drink hit him with a loud splash, soaking his face and pricey suit. He just stood there, stunned, as the liquid dripped from his hair and down his face.



spoiled dish? You told mne you wanted an ordinary housewife. Dad and Mom told me they wanted an obedient daughter,who never outdid anyone!"



Without hesitation, she threw the glass to the floor.The sharp crash instantly silenced the whole room.


Roger's face turned red with embarrassment. His jaw tightened."Have you lost your mind?"


From the stage, the Jenkins couple yelled at her."Alexia, this is Marilee's birthday, not a place for your drama!"



People in the crowd rolled their eyes and muttered that she was nuts.



None of them had a clue what she had given up for the two families all these years.
Shoving through the crowd, Alexia made a beeline for the exit. Reporters swarmed after her like a flood.



She shoved past them all, blind to the pouring rain,deaf to the murmurs and judgment surrounding her.Right now, all she wanted was to get away-far from the noise, the eyes, and the humiliation.



But just as she broke through the crowd and made it outside, a bunch of Marilee's wild fans shoved her hard,and she slipped, landing on the wet road.



Marilee was an A-list star in showbiz. Her birthday party was being livestreamed, and tons of fans had gathered outside. The second they saw Alexia step out, the crowd lost it, shouting like wild animals who had just found something to attack.



"Alexia, you've got some nerve attending Marilee's birthday party. You've got no shame!"



"You're not even the real daughter. Just go back to whatever dump you came from, or are you too hooked on the Jenkins' money?"



"Roger's going to divorce you, and you still think it's okay to show your face around Marilee? Who do you think you are?"



"Go away already!"

Alexia lay there on the wet street, frozen for a second,while their nasty words echoed all around her.



She let out a dry, bitter laugh. Everything was such a joke. A broken marriage, a cold family, and now they'd left her completely humiliated.


What was the point of pretending for so long? She had kept her head down, put up with everything, and this was what she got in the end?


A wave of helplessness washed over her. She closed her eyes, not even caring anymore as the freezing rain drenched her.



Through the noise and chaos, a flattering voice broke through. "Mr. Mason." The polite greeting was followed by firm, steady footsteps coming closer in the rain.


Moments later, a black umbrella appeared above her,silently cutting through the rain and offering her shelter from the storm.
###Chapter 2 Meeting Him Again At Her Absolute...
Alexia slowly looked up and met a sharp,intense gaze.



The streetlights flickered in the rain. Waylon Mason stood there, tall and intimidating, with a strong presence that made people uncomfortable.



Behind him was a row of fancy cars parked along the street, catching everyone's eye.



His assistants were standing on both sides of him,and one was holding an umbrella over his head.



But the umbrella Waylon was holding was tilted just to cover Alexia.



Waylon took a slow step forward and leaned in.Before she could react, his fingers reached up and removed the heavy, black-rimmed glasses from her face. Her bright, beautiful eyes were now fully visible.


He looked down at her with a smirk. "It's been years Alexia. Look at you-what a mess. Did you finally stop being that love-crazy girl, or are you still dreaming useless dreams?"



Every word cut deeper. Alexia's eyes started to tear up, and the little bit of strength she had left broke down under his harsh v/oice.



She opened her mouth to retort, but before she could speak, Waylon suddenly picked her up in his arms in front of everyone, protecting her from the rain and everything around them.



He walked toward the black car waiting nearby,carrying her as the bodyguards quickly stepped aside to make way.



All the noise and the rude comments around them faded away.



Everyone just stood there, stunned, watching them leave with shock written all over their faces.








Inside the car, Alexia held onto her muddy, soaked dress with trembling hands.



She looked down, her voice rough. "Waylon,why'd you have to show up now?"



Why now... when everything in her life was falling apart?



Waylon tilted his head at her question, then reached out and took her chin in his hand, gently but firmly lifting her face. His voice was calm, yet carried a cold edge. "Why else? I came to check on the woman l liked the least."



His eyes darkened, a smirk playing on his lips. "So Alexia, do you remember what I said to you seven years ago?"



Of course she did.



Waylon was the golden child of the Mason family. Her biggest rival back in the day.



The last time they met was at the airport, seven years ago. What was meant to be a goodbye turned into their worst fight.



Waylon always hated how she begged for the Jenkins family's approval and how she held onto Roger like she had no pride. And she couldn't stand his ego and how he judged everyone she cared about.



Back then, he'd warned her clearly-chasing approval from people who'd never truly accept her would only end in disappointment, leaving her with nothing in the end.



But she was too hopeful to see it. She had told herself, "It's okay if they don't like me now. If I work hard and put them first, they'll accept me eventually."



They wanted her to marry Roger, so she agreed.Her brothers didn't want her getting too powerful,so she acted clueless and average. But behind the scenes,she was quietly taking out their threats and protecting both the Jenkins and the Gibson families.



As Waylon's fingers held her jaw tightly, her warm tears fell on his hand, running down his knuckles. His expression wavered. The coldness faded just for a second. Then, he let go



Alexia's voice shook, still raspy from the rain."Waylon,you were right. They tossed me aside after exploiting me. For more than twenty years, I gave them everything I had. I was so stupid."



It was a long time before Waylon finally spoke again."You were not stupid. They just weren't worth it."



But Alexia didn't respond.



He turned to look at her and saw her fast asleep.



Later that night, Alexia suddenly came down with a high fever.



Santino Blake, Waylon's personal doctor, got pulled out of bed by a single call and had to grab his stuff and rush over late at night.



With his years of experience, Santino quickly ran a full checkup. He stood by the bed, looking at Alexia's pale,tired face, and let out a soft sigh.
###Chapter 3 Our Luna Is Back
Santino glanced over his shoulder and caught sight of Waylon on the balcony, cigarette burning slowly between his fingers.



Smoke curled up in lazy spirals, casting a ghostly veil over Waylon's sharp features, softening them with each exhale.



Waylon rarely smoked. Santino could only recall one other time Waylon had smoked like this-two years ago.



Santino stepped outside and joined him. "She's stable now. She just picked up a chill from being stuck in the rain and took the shock pretty hard. I've given her an injection and some medication-she'll be all right."


A brief pause allowed Santino to scan the night sky "I checked the headlines. The Jenkins family didn't just cut her off; they humiliated her for everyone to see-right in the middle of Marilee's birthday party."


Anger edged into Santino's voice. "Hadn't they done a DNA test before taking her back from abroad? This whole thing smells like a setup."



A sudden vibration broke his focus-Alexia's phone was buzzing on the nightstand.


Waylon strode inside, intent on ending the call, but the name flashing on the screen stopped him cold. A flicker of something dark flashed across his eyes as he picked up and put on the speaker.



Shouting erupted instantly, the caller's anger unmistakable.



"Alexia, you've ignored every call and message.What exactly are you trying to pull? Faking your own disappearance won't help. Tomorrow, you're signing the divorce agreement, and that's the end of it. I've shown enough patience. Stop standing in the way of Marilee and me. You've lived off the Jenkins family long enough. If you have any dignity left, walk away for good-it's the least you can do for Marilee. Don't worry about your share-you'll get what's coming. You looked after my grandmother and my mother these past years, fine. But don't overstep. Learn when to quit. Why aren't you answering me? Where are you?"



The stillness that lingered on the line finally made Roger uneasy. His confidence wavered and his words lost their edge.



Santino internally begged for someone to step in and stop what was happening, feeling panic surge as things slipped further from control. From the moment Roger started speaking, Santino caught the way Waylon's face darkened. His eyes went cold and every hint of warmth vanished,leaving the atmosphere icy and suffocating. Santino could barely stand, knees threatening to give way.


Waylon's expression turned sharp, his smile edged with cruelty. "So that's the way you speak to her,huh?"


Every muscle in Roger's body tensed, instincts screaming a warning. His voice grew cautious. "Who are you? Where is Alexia?"



Waylon let his gaze settle on the bed, where Alexia rested, her breathing faint but even. His response came as a gentle murmur, almost lost in the tension."She's asleep."



He let a short silence hang before adding, "And she's right here with me."



The only thing that answered him was the explosive sound of rage through the phone. Roger's voice thundered down the line. "What did you just say? Who are you?"



Amusement glimmered in Waylon's eyes as a low chuckle slipped out. "Relax. You'll figure it out..assuming you live long enough." Without another word,he ended the call.
By morning, the rain had vanished, leaving sunlight streaming through the windows as Alexia stirred awake.



She reached for her phone, greeted by a storm of missed calls and furious messages from Roger.



Without reacting, she scrolled through the flood of texts, then let the device drop onto the sheets. Right now,a hot shower mattered more.



Steam fogged the bathroom mirror as she faced her reflection. Something had changed-her eyes, once dull,now held a spark she hadn't seen in ages.


For the first time in ages, she tried out a smile, and this one actually reached her eyes, genuine and alive.


It felt like a fever had burned away all her confusion,stripping her heart of old pain and foolish loyalty to those who never deservedit.



No more playing the fool. No more pretending everything was fine. This sad story was over.



Wrapped in a towel after the shower, she scanned her contacts and paused on a name untouched for years



Her call barely rang once before chaos exploded on the other end. "Luna! It's about damn time! Tell me-are the rumors true? You're finally getting a divorce?"
Laughter and shouting burst from the background,her friends making no attempt to hide their eavesdropping.



Alexia replied calmly, "Yes, I'm going to sign the divorce agreement today."



Celebration roared through the phone. Whistles,cheers, the clink of glasses-her friends were clearly turning it into a full-blown party



"Took you long enough to snap out of that trance! No more housewife blues. Our Luna is back!"



"Divorce is the best thing to happen to you! Roger never deserved you. Say the word and I'll handle him myself!"



"And don't get me started on that overrated Jenkins family. If not for you, they'd have collapsed during last year's crash. Luna, we're ready when you are-the Garden of Eden stands with you."



Their laughter and support brought a genuine grin to Alexia's lips. "In that case, I need a ride."



Without missing a beat, a man's voice broke in,buzzing with excitement.ride? For your grand return? Name it. I'lI send the reigning racing champion to pick you up!"

###Chapter 4 Do You Believe Me

The call had barely ended when the soft click of the door caught Alexia's attention, her head snapping up.



There in the doorway stood Waylon,his height casting a shadow,his expression giving nothing away as their eyes met.


Neither of them had anticipated this kind of encounter.


Fresh from the shower,Alexia's hair clung damply to her cheeks, a robe slipping low on her shoulders,skin flushed and eyes still hazy with warmth.


That oversized bathrobe, threatening to slip further,revealed soft lines of skin; the faint scent of shampoo lingered in the air, sweet and impossible to ignore.


Waylon's gaze swept over her, lingering just long enough for her cheeks to flush, before he looked away calmly. "Get ready. Breakfast is on the table."①


Moments later,Alexia emerged dressed,met by the aroma of a beautifully arranged breakfast. Hunger wvon out over pride; she took her seat without pretense,finishing most of the meal before pausing for breath.

Little was said as Waylon let her eat in peace, only breaking the silence after she'd nearly cleared her plate. "You need a lawyer?"



She set down her coffee cup. eyes meeting his squarely. "So you've heard."



Amusement tugged at his mouth, though his eyes stayed cold. "Is there anyone left who doesn't?"



Alexia tasted the bitterness of the coffee and grimaced for just a moment, though she quickly composed herself. "I can deal with it."



As the words left her mouth, she realized he might think she was too stubbom to admit she naadod holp.After all, in most people's eyes,womam baing dumped were pathetic.



"Do you believe me when I say that?" she asked.



A smirk played on Waylon's face. eyes narrowing with a knowing glint. "Why wouldn't l? Alexia, he's the one who should've fallen apart."



That unwavering gaze held her still, though she managed a small, genuine smile in return. "You've always known how to make a good point."



Once breakfast was done, Alexia got ready to leave. Reaching the doorway, she stopped and glanced back."Thank you," she said quietly, her gratitude unmistakable.



There was no chance she'd forget his kindness.







Ten minutes had ticked past their appointment, and Roger's patience was quickly wearing thin as he and Marilee waited for Alexia in a private club.



"Why isn't she here yetP ls tharefuking to divorce you?"Marilee pressed hersolf clower to hum, wugar in hor tone as she poutod. "You havan't forgottan our shopping plans, right? You promttnd yourd buy me a gown after this."



Roger hummed in response The weokends banquet held by the Chamber of Commerce would be the perfect stage to introduce Manilee-the timing of her comeback couldn't have been more ideal. Every influential name in town would be present, all eyes fixed on Waylon's much-anticipated return.



Just thinking about Waylon sent a flicker of unease across Roger's face.



The Chamber of Commerce's open support for Waylon right before the election of its new president wasn't exactly good news for the Gibson family. A sudden uproar near the doorway snapped Roger's focus.



His head turned, and in that instant, itfelt as though the atmosphere in the room shifted.



Everyone's attention zeroed in on a single figure gliding inside with effortless grace.


Alexia walked in, her crimson dress hugging every curve, heels whispering over the polished floor.Each stride radiated poise and quiet confidence. The scarlet hue, that unmistakable glow-sha looked like the sunrise brought to life.



With each step Alexia took. Marilkm's smile grow tighter, until it disoppemrod mltogathor wthion Alexia claimed the seat across from them



Roger couldn't hide his shock either, his eyes remained glued to Alexia's artfully made-up features.



"You..." Words caught in his throat, visible in the small,nervous bob of his Adam's apple.



Nobody present could believe this woman was the same person from last night-the awkward glasses,the baggy checkered shirt, the sopping hair.



Yesterday's pitiful girl had been replaced by someone utterly different, confident, unrecognizable. Nothing about their surprise caught Alexia off guard.Her beauty wasn't news to her; she'd just chosen not to make a show of it. Childhood lessons had always emphasized modesty, staying out of the spotlight.never inviting too much notice.



Marriage only tightened the leash. Years spent tending to Roger's grandmother and fielding disapproval from a mother-in-law who'd been fed tales of her sO-called wild youth.



Not even her hair or the color of her clothes escaped scrutiny. Every detail had been censored into drab submission.



Vibrant dresses never made it to her closet-only baggy, forgettable options filled the shGlV04



That ###Chapter,though, was behind her



With unhurried confidence,Alexia called over a server,ordered a tequila, and began paging through the divorce agreement-unfazed by the attention.


Marilee recovered her composure first, flashing a sweet smile. "Alexia, I hope you're alright after yesterday. The reporters caught us all off guard.Someone told me you slipped in the rain.It must have been miserable out there,"

###Chapter 5 Watching Her Unravel
Patience faded on Marilee's face as she waited for a reaction, but Alexia wouldn't even meet her eyes.Instead, she directed her attention to Roger. "Is the Gibson fortune going up in flames? This is all I'm worth?”



A shadow crossed Roger's face. "That's what the prenup says, so that's all you're entitlled to"



Even before they got married, he'd clonad avary door to the family's fortune, making suro she'd nover find a loophole.



Realizing Alexia was blatantly ignonng her. Marilee butted in. "You're getting more than enough, Alexia Wasit love or money you wanted from Roger,anyway?"



Alexia still refused to acknowledge her. not so much as a glance. "With an amount this pitiful? Hang on to it-you'll need every last cent when the Gibson empire falls apart."



Those words wiped any patience from Roger's face."Don't push it, Alexia."



Suddenly, Marilee's eyes shimmered with tears and  her voice went brittle, as though her heart might break. "Please, Alexia, don't do this to Roger," she whimpered.


The crowd's attention snapped toward her as sobs and sniffles filled the space.



Marilee reached for the delicate pink diamond at her throat. "Maybe you never knew, but Roger and I have loved each other for years. He gave me this necklace on your wedding day-it's a symbol of his devotion.That cherry blossom garden in your backyard? Roger built it just for me, hoping I'd smile. You stole my life.Everything you have should have been mine. Don't you think it's time you let go and laft quietly. without asking for more?"



An uncomfortable hush sottled over the room



It was rare to see a mistress acting so brazenly,demanding the wife walk away with empty hands.


Finally,Alexia turned to meet Marilee's eyes, her voice colder than ice. "I stole your life? Was it me who went to the Jenkins family, begging them to accept me?Was I the one who refused a DNA test and strutted around calling myself their true daughter? Did I chase after Roger, desperate for a marriage?"



Every pointed question shattered the silence,each one sharp enough to cut.All color drained from Marilee's face, her body rigid beneath Alexia's icy stare. Not missing a beat, Alexia delivered the final blow. "Go blame your own foolish parents."


That snapped the last of Marilee's restraint. "If it weren't for them, you'd still be digging through garbage. You've been living a luxurious life for twenty years. Without them, you'd be nothing but a pauper."


A sharp laugh spilled from Alexia. Her gaze drifted to the faded needle marks on her wrist. "If this is what luxury looks like,I must have missed out. Pain,though?There was always enough of that to go around."



Disbelief filled Marilee's oyes. her words trembling with contempt. "Lies. You grew up suoundad by filth -you're nothing but garbage if my paronts hadn't stepped in, you'd be gone by now. Some gang would have had its way with you and left you in the gutter-"



The rest never left her mouth. A sharp slap rang out,echoing in the room.



Stunned, Marilee pressed trembling fingers to the swelling red mark,speechless.


A cold smile curved Alexia's lips. "There's nothing l despise more than people who never learned basic decency.The Jenkins family or not, I'd still be standing here as myself. But you? Without that divorce agreement, you're nothing more than a shameless mistress."



Not waiting for a reaction, Alexia hurled the signed divorce agreement straight at Marilee, landing the hit with brutal precision. "Think of it as my parting gift."


Marilee flinched as the edges nicked her forehead.letting out a startled cry. The shock left her shaking,the color draining from her lips.



Alexia watched the panic unraveling Marilee's composure, noticing the nervous twitch on her face.Pretending to care, she cocked her head and offered,"Do you need me to call an ambulance for you?"



That question broke whatever restraint Marilee had left."Why would you ever do that?" she snapped.



Alexia gave her a look laced with fake concern."It just seems like you're not well at all."



Marilee's voice cracked as she screamed, "I am not sick!"



Even Roger turned, uncertain and uneasy as her shrill denial filled the room.



Unbothered, Alexia let her reply drip with venom,hitting every nerve. "Funny. People who are actually unwell always insist they're fine. Might be time to book yourself a session with a psychiatrist. And before I forget... cute necklace. But honestly? Junk stones aren't worth much these days."



Marilee's face turned ashen,her fury and humiliation overwhelming her. Without warning, she collapsed straight into Roger's arms.


Anger carved hard lines into Roger's face as he pulled Marilee close, glaring at Alexia. "I never realized you could be so cruel. Just because you wore my ring,you think you can say whatever you want?"



Before Alexia could offer a comeback, a familiar voice cut through the tension, heavy with mockery. "Really?That's your angle? Just because she wore your ring,you think you could speak to her like that?"



A collective gasp swept through the crowd, all attention snapping to the doorway. There, tall and dangerously handsome,a man entered, charm radiating effortlessly with every step.
###Chapter 6 The Butt Of A Cosmic Joke
A casual brown trench coat draped over the man's shoulders, subtle yet impossible to overlook. Striking features seemed carved for attention-this was a face that commanded the room without trying. Tousled,ash-gray hair tumbled over his shoulders, lending a devil-may-care air that was both dangerous and magnetic.



The energy in the room spiked the instant he crossed the threshold.Whispers raced across the space,young women visibly struggling to contain their excitement.



"Wait, am I hallucinating? Isn't that Andre Cooper?The racing legend?"



"You mean the youngest person ever to win the Grand Slam? No way-he's even better-looking up close."



Andre Cooper, fully aware of the commotion,offered a gleaming, cocky smile, every bit as daring as his reputation. Just by being there, he managed to make Roger seem utterly forgettable.



"Look at that! It's actually him! And that's his Bugatti VGT out fromt-the only one of its kind. There's already a crowd forming just to catch a glimpse. Is he really taking a vacation in Afoross?"



With the crowd buzzing, Roger and Marilee sat frozen,shock tightening their expressions.



Andre Cooper? How on earth did Alexia wind up in his orbit? The gap between their worlds couldn't have been wider.



Anyone who'd spent time in show business, like Marilee, knew exactly what Andre meant-global headlines, endorsement deals, and influence beyond her wildest reach. And that same man had just defended Alexia.



And it looked like he was not merely defending her



Andre locked eyes with Alexia and crossed the floor,heading straight to her without hesitation. With practiced ease, he dropped his hands onto her shoulders.



With a mischievous tilt of his head, he teased, "Are you planning to keep me waiting all day?"



Rolling her eyes, Alexia asked, "Why did you have to come in? | told you to wait."



An exaggerated pout curled Andre's lips. "I've been waiting outside for ages. You think I'd let you deal with these vultures alone?" He tossed Roger one sharp look. "Seems I was right to worry. Guys who pick the wrong women are always hopeless in other ways too."


Roger's temper nearly boiled over, a vein throbbing at his temple as he glared at those hands on Alexia."Well done, Alexia," he sneered. "Never figured you had it in you. This isn't the guy I chatted with on the phone yesterday. Are you handling more than one man these days?"



A dangerous edge glinted in Andre's eyes, but Alexia didn't so much as blink. "Not everyone has to scrape the bottom of the barrel for company," she retorted.cold and unflappable.



For a second, Roger was speechless. Then he let out a bitter, hollow laugh, his eyes sweeping over Alexia's unapologetically bold look.



"I always pegged you as some buttoned-up housewife,all prim skirts and those dreadful glasses, playing the shy librarian routine. Turns out you had your own party going on in the shadows. Tell me, how much of that little act was for my benefit?"


Alexia didn't waste energy defending herself. "I don't owe you a single explanation. You parade your affair for everyone to see, but I'm not allowed a private life?Don't kid yourself, Roger. We both know what this marriage really is. Spare me the outrage."


Roger's hands balled into fists. He couldn't pretend- he'd always known their marriage was just for shoW.



That knowledge only fed his fury. Glaring at Andre, he let his words drip poison. "You heard her. She likes collecting men. You think you're something special?Don't flatter yourself. You're just the latest in a long line."



Feigning a look of surprise, Andre brought Alexia's hand to his lips, flashing an over-the-top adoring grin."Alexia, am I finally worthy of your illustrious roster?"



She shot him a dry, sidelong look. "You're putting words in my mouth."



Andre's grin widened, and he nudged her playfully."Just say the word. I'd gladly stand in line if it meant a chance with you."



Those words seemed to hang in the air for a beat,leaving every jaw in the room suspended in shock.



Was this for real? The famously aloof racer,usually all icy coolness and edge, now grinning like a fool in love? The scene was almost absurd.



All eyes flicked toward Roger, their pity unmistakable -he looked like the butt of a cosmic joke



Marilee's teeth dug so hard into her lip that she nearly broke the skin, jealousy seething just beneath the surface. Roger's face clouded over, his good looks twisted by rage and disbelief. "Alexia, you actually think you can get away with this!"



He shoved back from the table, ready to lunge, but Andre reacted in a flash, catching his arm and twisting it behind him with practiced skill.



Pain twisted Roger's features as he glared up at Andre."Let me go."



Andre's grin sharpened, taking on a predatory quality as he pressed harder, asking, "Sorry, what was that?"



Frustration boiling over, Roger shouted, "I said let go!"His voice was taut with pain, and his struggle sent glasses tumbling off the table with a crash.



The commotion caught the club manager's eye,but Andre's cool exterior never faltered-only a deadly chill entered his gaze. "You'll have to speak up," he mocked, voice lilting with dangerous ease. "Didn't quite catch that."



A sudden, sickening pop rang out, silencing the room in an instant.



The color drained from Marilee's cheeks, terror freezing her in place. "Stop! Let him go!"



Turning to Alexia, she yelled, "You're really just going to sit there? Do something! Make him stop!"
###Chapter 7 A Conspiracy
Despite the chaos around her, Alexia didn't move an inch. She stayed perfectly composed, her fingers intertwined and her chin gently propped on them,watching Roger in silence, who was now soaked in cold sweat.



She couldn't believe she'd wasted her time on someone like him-shrinking herself, holding back,staying in a marriage that should've never happened.



The club manager walked up, eyeing the mess around him. He didn't dare to intervene, so he turned to Alexia and pleaded, "Ma'am, could you help us out here?"



The whole thing had turned into a circus. Marilee was still yelling and crying, Roger looked in pain, and the crowd treated it like a live show, enjoying every second.



Alexia gave a small, cold smile, clearly unimpressed.Honestly, she was already bored. "Andre, let him go."


Andre snorted sarcastically but did what she said and Let go of Roger's arm.


Alexia stood up slowly, her tone steady and firm.

"Roger, I don't want your money. Just make sure you show up at the courthouse tomorrow to finalize the divorce. Don't make me wait. And if there's still a shred of decency in you, look after your grandmother.She's the only one in the Gibson family who ever gave a damn about you."



Roger's whole body stiffened. He snapped his head up,clearly shocked.Alexia looked completely unbothered,but somehow, it felt like she actually pitied him.



That hit him harder than he wanted to admit. What was that look supposed to mean?



Who did she think she was, giving him that look? Like she could read him inside out? Like she felt sorry for him?



Roger started to lose it again, but before he could step forward, Marilee clung to his arm in panic. "Roger,you need to go to the hospital! Stop paying attention to her!"



"Let go of me!" Roger snapped, pushing her hand off."Alexia, don't you dare walk away!"



His angry voice followed her, but Alexia didn't even flinch. She glanced back just once, seeing Marilee clinging tightly to Roger's arm like a lifeline. That possessive hold-it was clear Marilee was terrified he might still chase after her.

For a moment, Alexia found it hard to believe she had once fought so hard for this man. How could she have spent all those years trying to hold onto something that was never worth it in the first place?



The thought nearly made her laugh. She shook her head and walked off without a second thought.



Roger was no longer someone she'd ever turn back for.



Andre stayed close, matching her pace. A swarm of reporters and onlookers had gathered outside,clogging the entrance and flashing cameras in every direction.



But unlike the night before, Alexia was completely composed. Every step she took carried quiet strength -an aura that made people think twice before getting in her way.



Sensing her change in demeanor, the reporters didn't dare swarm her this time. Instead, they turned their focus on Andre, throwing all their questions at him.



Andre took control of the scene with his usual charm.Smiling confidently, he fielded each question thrown his way without missing a beat. "Yeah, I'm just here for a little vacation. The views are stunning, the food's fantastic, and the people aren't bad either."
Then, with a nonchalant shrug, he continued, "Of course, I've known Alexia for quite some time.I happened to be in town when I heard about the divorce and figured it was as good a reason as any to toast to a fresh start."



The crowd laughed, but the questions kept coming-sharper and more eager now.



"Roger Gibson? No, thanks. That guy's bad for the mood." Andre shook his index finger.



"What's my relationship with Alexia?" He paused,smirking slightly. "Take a guess."



The dramatic pause did the trick. Then, he delivered the line with a playful grin. "I'm pursuing her."



That one sentence set the whole crowd off.Gasps filled the air as reporters scrambled to catch every word,rushing to publish the scoop of the day-"World -Class Racer Confesses to Chasing After Former Jenkins Heiress!"



Soon after, they made it into the car. Andre started the engine, while Alexia leaned back in her seat,amused. "Thanks for the help, Andre. Your acting's getting pretty good."


Andre gave her a look. "Who said I was acting?"
"Come on. You've always had my back-that part's genuine." She let out a soft laugh.



Andre let out a dramatic sigh. "Knew you'd say that.But never mind, let's move on. I've got something to tell you."



"What is it?" Alexia asked, curious.



"It's about your past.”



Her eyes narrowed a bit, but Andre didn't stop."Right after the news dropped about Marilee being the real daughter, we started digging. Her mother has been wiring money every month to a woman, Ms. Carter.She is the wife of a rich businessman from Brookline and Marilee's adoptive mother. The payments started twenty-four years ago-the exact year you and Marilee were born. That means the Jenkins family already knew who their real daughter was-long before they brought you in. From everything we've seen,the Jenkins family taking you in wasn't a mistake,but intentional-a conspiracy."

###Chapter 8 A Task

Alexia let out a bitter laugh.o that's how it is. No wonder the Jenkins couple always looked at me like l didn't belong. They brought me into their home, but their real daughter had to live in someone else's home.Of course they resented me. Why didn't you tell mne this sooner?"



Andre simply shrugged, looking totally unbothered."Gaia's orders. She thought you needed to trip up a bit and said it'd help you grow some character."


Alexia narrowed her eyes at him. "Typical. I'm guessing you and Gaia already dug into Roger and Marilee's affair long ago,right?"



Andre chuckled. "If you want the evidence, we've got plenty."



Alexia waved it off without hesitation. "No need.They're not worth the effort."



Her bluntness made Andre raise an eyebrow. "NowI'm really curious-what did you ever see in Roger?"



That question gave Alexia pause. She sifted through old memories, but all that surfaced was the image of that stubborn, broken boy from long ago-the only version of him that had ever truly stayed with her.



"I don't remember."



But deep down, she knew the truth that Roger was never the point. Growing up as an orphan before the Jenkins family found her, all she ever wanted was a real family. Everything she did-every sacrifice,every choice-was about winning love,about making people proud of her.



That mindset had followed her into adulthood,especially in relationships. Love, to her, meant lifting the other person up, pouring everything into them,and hoping they'd return even a fraction of it.


And marriage? Back then, she thought it was the key to finally being loved-something she had to earn,not something she deserved.



But standing in the present, looking back, she couldn't help but laugh at how wrong she had been.



Andre didn't look surprised. That familiar smirk tugged at his lips, amused and knowing. "I figured."



She tilted her head. "Figured what?"



"That it was never really about Roger. Most people think they understand love, but they don't. You didn't either." He shot her a playful grin. "Roger just happened to be there. If I'd met you back then, broken, desperate, and just as lost as him, maybe you'd be with me now,huh?"



Alexia gave him a sharp look, ready to shut him down,but before she could speak, Andre suddenly turned the wheel and sent the car drifting smoothly through a tight corner.



Startled, she grabbed the seatbelt and glared at him as the cars around them skidded to a halt in panic."Pull a stunt like that again in the city and they'll revoke your license."



Andre just laughed, unfazed. "So what? Let them. I've still got my pro racing license-they can't touch that."



Just then, her phone buzzed in her hand.



She looked down. It was a call from Eleanor Gibson,Roger's grandmother.



A flicker of hesitation crossed her face before she finally picked up.



"Hi, Eleanor... No, I wasn't avoiding you... I'll stop by tonight."



Andre didn't say a word and quietly listened until the call disconnected, right as the traffic light switched to green.


He gave her a sideways glance.,where to now?"

Alexia let out a slow breath, clearly reluctant. "Golden Lake Estate. Thanks."



The place belonged to the Gibson family, where Roger's grandparents lived.



Andre gave a mock salute, tapping two fingers to his temple. "Anything for you."



Alexia gave him a dry stare but didn't respond



A short while later, they pulled up outside the estate.As Alexia reached for the door, Andre hesitated, like something had been on his mind for a while. "Actually,there's another reason I came to Afoross. I've got a task I need your help with."



Alexia's hand paused on the door handle. "What kind of task?"



Andre's expression turned serious. "A batch of biotech chips was smuggled out of the Garden of Eden recently. The most important one is embedded in a crown-the Adam's Heart. It's already in Afoross and is set to be auctioned at the upcoming charity gala held by the Chamber of Commerce. I'm sure you can guess the top bidders at that event. One of them will be the buyer. And we can't let the chip fall into the wrong hands. We need you to get that crown-ideally,through Waylon Mason."

At the mention of that name. Alexia frowned and asked. "Why him?"



Andre's usual smirk returned "You've really been out of the loop. huh? The Chamber of Commerce is about to elect a new president. And lets just say backroom politics are in full swing. That charity auction is being framed as a public welcome party for Waylon. So, you see where this is going?"


Even people who didn't follow politics could tell something big was going to happen.



Andre dropped his voice a notch. "Only Waylon has the clout to shut that auction down without causing a storm."



If he stepped in, it would settle everything smoothly -no arguments, no messy fallout.


Alexia narrowed her eyes. "That still doesn't explain why you want me involved. You all know I'm not exactly on good terms with him."


"Oh, come on. That was years ago. Who knows?Maybe things have changed. Besides, rumor has it Waylon's planning to show up at the Equestrian and Shooting Tournament soon. Why don't you seize the chance to mend fences?" Andre threw her a playful wink.

Alexia pushed the door open and slammed it shut behind her.

###Chapter 9 Not Looking Back

The Gibson family's butler blinked, hardly disguising his astonishment, when Alexia climbed out of the cherry-red Bugatti. Questions lingered behind his eyes,but he simply gestured for her to follow and guided her into the house with practiced grace.



"Mrs. Gibson, Eleanor's hardly talked about anything but you lately. You made it intime for supper. Why not stay and keep her company?"



Without a flicker of warmth, Alexia answered, "Just call me Alexia. I'm no longer Roger's wife."



For a split second, he faltered, caught off guard by her words.



The city had been buzzing with talk of the split Eleanor wanted to mediate, but from the way Alexia carried herself, the butler could tell there wasn't much hope.



That villa, so often silent and chilly, seemed unchanged. Alexia stepped inside and spotted Eleanor on the sofa, a welcoming smile lighting up her face."Alexia, come join me."


Trying her best to appear cheerful, Alexia made her way over. Eleanor's hand found hers, gentle and warm,her tone laced with concern. "You picked a rough time to arrive, sweetheart. Allen just stormed off,determined to haul Roger back here. We've heard all about what's happened lately. I promise,we won't let him carry on like this."



A shadow flickered in Alexia's eyes. "I've already signed the divorce agreement. I'm not looking back anymore."



That response made Eleanor stiffen. "So, this is all because of Marilee, isn't it? | couldn't care less about that mess with her or the whole talk about some 'real daughter.' All I see is you. I won't accept anyone else as Roger's wife. He's still young and easily manipulated by some scheming woman. Let me handle him."



Alexia only shook her head. "No, I've let it go. I know when it's time to walk away. When I love someone,I stay by their side. And when that love fades, I move on. I'm finished waiting for a man to grow up. I'm through making excuses for his choices. Roger picked Marilee, and that's his problem now. I want nothing to do with it. The past is behind me. I'm ready for a new beginning."



There was something in her voice-firm and unwavering-that made Eleanor pause.



Moments stretched out before the rims of Eleanor's

eyes turned red. "I've watched you grow up, Alexia.You were like my own granddaughter. Roger had it rough as a kid. When he finally came back,he was wild,hard to handle. No one welcomed him, except for you."



For a moment, Alexia's resolve faded.Deep down,she understood her feelings for Roger were always tangled up in the gratitude she felt for Eleanor.The warmth she received from the old woman had filled the empty places the Jenkins family never cared about. That was why she had a soft spot for Roger,since he was Eleanor's grandson.



Eleanor knew exactly what was going on. She let out a weary breath. "Roger has no idea what he lost. He believed he could stomp all over your feelings just because you loved him."



A sharp voice echoed down from above before Alexia could reply. "Let's stop pretending she's all virtuous.She's not even a real Jenkins. And she's played the role of Mrs. Gibson for two years. Roger's the one who got scammed.Now that he's found someone worth his time, who can blame him for moving on?"



There was Brandon Gibson-Roger's cousin, arrogant and unbothered, shuffling down the stairs in pajamas.He sprawled across from Alexia on the couch,throwing her a sly smirk. "Didn't take long to drop the boring housewife act, huh? You're not fooling anyone."

"That's enough, Brandon!" Eleanor shot back, voice sharp with anger. "Is this really how you talk to people?Take a good look at yourself. You can't even show the decency to put on proper clothes in front of guests Shame on you!"



Sinking into the cushions, Brandon crossed his legs,an insufferable grin spreading across his face. "Please.She's not worthy of it."



Anger crept up Eleanor's cheeks, and her breath turned shallow. Alexia reached over,her hand a gentle anchor on Eleanor's back. "Don't let him get to you,Eleanor."



Alexia's attention shifted to Brandon, her eyes cold and assessing, as if she were staring at something best ignored.



If she ever doubted it before,she was sure now-the Gibsons were all glitter and no gold. Roger barely stood out as halfway capable. The rest dragged the family name through the mud. Brandon? He was the perfect example of wasted potential.



Before divorcing Roger, she'd spent far too much time picking up after Brandon, mostly for Roger's sake and partly out of stubborn goodwill. In return, she earned nothing but resentment. He was the kind of leech who latched on tighter with every favor.
Catching the chill in her eyes, Brandon bristled."What's with that face? Don't act like I'm making this up. If it weren't for my cousin's payout, you'd be sleeping on the street tonight."



Eleanor'spatience ran out. "Enough!Notanother word."


Brandon liked to think of himself as the family's black sheep, too cool to care about lectures. Still,something in her quiet unnerved him far more than Eleanor's yelling ever could.



"Why aren't you saying anything, huh?" he asked



An uneasy hush settled over the room.



Alexia kept still, her expression impossible to read,until she finally looked at Eleanor and whispered, "I'm sorry."



She rose without another word, collecting her purse.



Seeing her head for the door, Brandon's eyes glimmered with a wicked challenge. He swung his leg into the aisle, barring her way, his grin cocky



That was his biggest mistake of the day. Alexia barely paused before she brought her gleaming heel down -squarely on his foot. The howl that followed left no doubt about her message.

###Chapter 10 Find A Way To Clean This Up
Every desperate tug from Brandon only made Alexia bear down harder, twisting her heel into his foot with pitiless intent.



"Get off me! What's wrong with you?" Pain cut through his voice, and his hands flew up in panic, only for Alexia to seize him by the wrist. He barely had time to catch his breath before her open palm struck his face, snapping his head to the side.



She didn't hold back-not for a moment. The slap rang out clear, leaving Brandon stunned, his jaw hanging open in disbelief.



Drawing close, Alexia dropped her voice to a dangerous whisper. "Who said you could even glance in my direction? With how empty your head is,I'm afraid I might catch stupidity just standing near you."


From her purse, she drew out a handkerchief,wiped her hand with slow, deliberate care, and then let the cloth flutter down onto his hair as if it were nothing but a piece of trash.



"Absolutely pitiful."
Without a second's hesitation, she strode away,never bothering to look back.


Brandon sat in silence, burning with embarrassment and unable to move.



The butler, finally regaining his senses, looked at Eleanor with alarm. "Ma'am..."



A slow shake of the head was Eleanor's only answer,her eyes never leaving Alexia's fading silhouette.Sorrow deepened her features. "She's never coming back."



No one in that house could claim to have known the real Alexia until that very moment.



A soft note of regret crept into Eleanor's tone."Roger was never good enough for her."







Hours later, Roger dragged himself back to the estate,hair mussed and clothes rumpled. He barely made it through the door before the thick, suffocating atmosphere hit him.


All the Gibson family members were assembled,faces set and unreadable, as if waiting for his confession.



He never imagined a divorce would leave the household in utter chaos.



Allen Gibson, the family patriarch, sat nursing a cup of coffee,his weathered eyes fixed on Roger with a look that chilled to the bone. Noticing the bandaged hand,Allen sneered, "Well, look who it is. Coming home looking like you've had a really bad day."


Roger stood his ground, jaw clenched, but stayed silent.





Allen continued, "Was this circus worth it? All that drama at Marilee's party, dragging our name through every paper in town. Are you satisfied with yourself?"



Gloria Gibson, Roger's mother, chimed in with venom,"This is all Alexia's fault..."



Allen asked, "Did I ask what you thought?"


Gloria's lips snapped shut, her anger swallowed by fear.





Turning even colder, Allen continued, "Your grandmother is so sick over you divorcing Alexia, she refuses to see you at all. She said one thing: throw Alexia away, and you could marry the first stranger you meet on the street for all she cares. But bring Marilee into this house? Never."



Roger's head snapped up. "Grandpa, Marilee's amazing.It's just that Grandma hasn't really spent time with her.
 Once she does, she'll-"



His plea ended in a sudden gasp as a coffee cup hurtled his way, smacking into his chest and sending a spray of hot coffee across his shirt. Shattered porcelain scattered across the floor.


Allen's voice cracked like a whip. "Fool. Do you seriously not understand what you did wrong?"



Heat radiated from every corner of the room, anger mixing with something heavier-deep disappointment.The next words from Allen felt heavier than a fist."The news is out-Waylon Mason will be the next president of the Chamber of Commerce."



Roger had prepared himself for this moment, yet confirmation of the news still unsettled him, stirring up a storm in his stomach.



He tried to make sense of it all. "Waylon Mason? He's so young. His qualifications-"


With a bitter chuckle, Allen interrupted. "Interesting to hear you talk about qualifications now. That man is a leader you could never dream of becoming. Do you even know what he's done? He's bulldozed impossible policies, locked in international deals, and forced the old president to abdicate. He's the youngest president in the history. Everyone envies him."


The way Allen stared at him left Roger feeling small.Were it not for tragedy robbing him of his only son.Allen never would have bothered seeking out a grandson born out of scandal, much less pouring resources into him.



"Roger, I handed you every advantage I could. Never expected you to climb to the very top, but those other roles? That should have been easy. You could have bouilt real power for yourself. But all that is gone -because of Marilee."



Roger's hands balled into tight fists.


Allen let out a sigh. "Your name is now linked to Marilee,the other woman. You're divorcing Alexia just because she's not a reaI Jenkins. You honestly believe Marilee's some kind of prize? People in our world don't marry for love-it's about strategy. The perfect marriage keeps up appearances, helps you squeeze every bit of advantage out of the story."



Allen's voice turned ice-cold. "Find a way to clean this up.Immediately."







That night, Alexia found herself in the quiet of a hotel suite. After a steaming shower, she wrapped herself in a robe, fingers flying over her phone as she sent Roger a message.
"Are you free tomorrow morning? We should meet and finish the divorce."
###Chapter 11 Enough To Wipe Out An Entire Family Tree
Eventually, Roger's reply appeared, as if dragged out of him.


"Got too much on my plate."



That reply earned nothing but a sharp, bitter laugh from Alexia as her temper spiked.



"So that's it? Feeling bold today, are we? Maybe I should round up a dozen men and send them straight to your doorstep-maybe that would get your attention."



Her message clearly struck a nerve. He fired back at once.



"You think everyone's as worthless as you are? Look at yourself-a washed-up housewife, no job, nothing but parties and chasing after men! I told you, I'm busy Wait until I say you're next!"


"Loser," muttered Alexia, right as her phone began to ring.



She picked up, greeted by a whirlwind of excitement."At last! You finally dumped that loser Roger-praise the heavens! Hurry up and come back. Everyone's waiting for you."


The voice belonged to Ada Douglas, Alexia's best friend since they were kids.


Ada's words made Alexia curious. "Everyone's waiting for me?"



Ada replied, "Absolutely! Afoross University's been hounding me. They want you to join the bio department. Remember how desperate they were to keep you when you graduated? Then you vanished into that whole housewife ###Chapter. People are still building off your research, you know. Those papers?Major impact. Professor Damon Ellis hasn't stopped bragging about you, his star student. He keeps pestering the department, telling everyone you're the best mind to come through in decades. He's ready to roll out the red carpet if you say yes."


Mixed feelings knotted inside Alexia. She had abandoned her ambitions and the scientific world she loved, all to play the flawless wife and keep the Jenkins and Gibson families afloat. Her old life had slipped through her fingers, sacrificed for a future that now felt painfully empty.


For ages, Ada had tried to coax her out of hiding, but every attempt met a wall-Alexia simply had nothing left to give.
Looking back now, regret gnawed at her. She had thrown away years for people who barely remembered to say thank you.



Resolve hardened inside her, tugging her lips into a confident smile. "Make it happen. Let's have that conversation."


Excitement bubbled over in Ada's reply. "Finally! You have no idea-things in the bio department are wild right now. They're signing government deals, cash is pouring in, but honestly, they're desperate for real talent. Even the Chamber of Commerce is sniffing around.My brother's been prying for details nonstop,but I'm just the admin. All those power plays are way above my pay grade."



As soon as she heard the Chamber of Commerce,Alexia couldn't help picturing Waylon. "Is your family caught up in the shake-up over there?"



A light laugh floated through the line. "Trust me,Douglas blood runs too thick for politics to scare us off. And with Mason stepping up? My brother's over the moon. He's already set on meeting him at the Equestrian and Shooting Tournament this weekend.Guess what? I'm a VIP at the club running the event.You should tag along-it'll be the perfect way to talk job details."



The timing felt almost cinematic. Amusement danced in Alexia's eyes, and her grin grew sharper. "I wouldn't miss it for anything."



Fast forward to the next day, and the Apex MAarksman Club buzzed with activity.


Alexia hadn't even gotten past the doors when trouble decided to greet her head-on.



There, blocking the entrance, stood Brandon,dressed like he'd rolled straight out of a motorcycle magazine,hair a blinding shade of cherry red, the poster child for privileged trouble. The glare he gave her could have cut glass.Clearly, seeing her again was the last thing he wanted.



Their last meeting had left his pride in shambles. This club was meant to be his escape, but fate seemed set on throwing Alexia right back in his path



Could his luck get any worse?



His blond friend stood next to him, grinning widely,totally unaware of the tension in the air. "'Hold up-isn't that your cousin's ex? The one who got tossed out? Didn't think she'd show her face here. Bet she's busy scrounging for spare change these days."



With his friend nearby, Brandon straightened his shoulders and let out a sneer. "Honestly, what else do you expect from a woman like her? She's here to find herself a new man. I bet she thinks none of us decent guys can tell she's nothing but trouble."


His words echoed a little louder than necessary.baiting the curiosity of every bystander.


"Did something just happen? Who's he calling out?"


"Wait, is it her? What did she do?"



Alexia's smile chilled the air, dripping with disdain as she fixed her gaze on him. "So all that barking was yours, Brandon? So, did you manage to pass your make-up tests this time? Or are you still drowning in gambling debts? Honestly, with all the times you've been fooled, I'm amazed there's anything left up there -if you can call it a brain."



A flush crept up Brandon's neck, his temper boiling over. "Tell me what part of what I said is wrong. This is a private club, not for a whore-"



Before he could even finish, Alexia sent him flying with a single, well-aimed kick, sending him sprawling down the marble steps.



A wave of shock rippled through the crowd as Brandon crashed and rolled, groaning, his pride shattered along with his composure.



Stillness settled for a split second. Then the whole place erupted All eyes locked on Alexia's blood-red heels, the kind that meant business. One kick from those and the damage was unforgettable.



All around, men instinctively drew their knees together, wincing in collective sympathy.


That was enough to wipe out an entire family tree.

###Chapter 12 Wally
Brandon was hunched over, holding his lower half like his life depended on it. His face twisted in pain as he let out a loud cry, like his soul had just been ripped from his body.



The scene was so shocking that even the club's security guards froze in place. His blond friend ran over in a panic, glancing nervously toward Brandon's lower half. "Bro, are you okay?"


Brandon's face twisted with fury, and his voice broke as he yelled, "Do I look okay to you? That crazy woman just kicked me. What are you all waiting for?Go grab her!"



But to his shock, not a single guard moved.



Instead, they looked past him, their faces turning serious.



The noisy crowd fell silent in an instant, like someone had flipped a switch. Conversations died mid-sentence. People began stepping aside without thinking, clearing a path straight through the middle.


A sharp, cutting voice broke the silence. "Brandon,who do you think you're messing with? And where'd you get the nerve?"



Heads turned as Ada appeared, arm-in-arm with her older brother, Korbin Douglas. Behind them, a squad of bodyguards in black followed closely. Their entrance didn't just command attention-it consumed it.



Everyone knew the Douglas siblings were close, but it was uncommon to see them in public together. Still,those who paid close attention noticed something else-both siblings walked to the left, while Elton Clark, the second son of the powerful Clark family,walked to the right.



And the one walking dead center was the man everyone instinctively focused on.



Tall,sharp-featured,and exuding a cold,commanding presence-Waylon. His aura was so strong, it felt like no one could touch him.



"Oh my God, it's him! It's really Waylon!"



"Whoa, no way-that's actually Waylon? How can someone look that insanely good? There's gotta be a law against it."



"Shh! Keep your voice down unless you want security throwing you out!"



The energy in the crowd crackled, even as people tried to stay composed. All eyes followed Waylon like he was royalty.



Waylon had been a legend since his school days. Even after being gone from Afoross for seven years,his name never faded.



While industries collapsed and markets struggled during economic downturns, he managed to breathe life back into Afoross's industries all by himself. Now,his name was known around the world.



To the business world, Waylon wasn't just influential -he was the kind of figure people looked to when everything else was falling apart.



Each of his steps echoed in that club like a slow-moving thunderclap.



As he passed, his eyes barely glanced at Brandon-cold and uninterested. But even that was enough. The guards immediately stepped in, dragging Brandon away like garbage blocking the way.


Brandon's pride took a hit, hisdignity crumbling right there, but he didn't dare say a word.



He knew better than to challenge someone like Waylon-the man at the center of the most powerful circle of heirs. Picking a fight with him wasn't just foolish, it was suicide.
Elton smirked as Brandon was dragged away like a kicked dog. "Bet Alexia's cringing watching this. Back in the day, she used to rush into casinos to defend that idiot. Got up in my face more than once."


Ada gave a half-laugh, sounding a little embarrassed "Come on, we've all made dumb choices when we were younger. Alexia's sober now. Why else do you think she completely humiliated Brandon today?"


Korbin raised an eyebrow. "So she's finally woken up and come to her senses?"



His eyes slid over to Alexia, still standing alone near the stairs. "Doesn't really seem like that to me. And she has Andre backing her up, doesn't she?"



He hadn't even finished talking before Ada sharply pinched him under his arm.



Korbin winced, plastering on an awkward smile as he turned to Waylon. "Maybe she actually does regret it.Who knows?"



Waylon stayed silent, but his eyes found Alexia's. In that split second, she saw it-just beneath his calm,polished surface was an unmistakable flash of annoyance.



They brushed past each other, barely inches apart,when Alexia suddenly reached out and grabbed his  wrist.



Waylon stopped. And with him, the entire area seemed to freeze.



His voice came out low, steady, and cold. "Let go."



The atmosphere tightened in an instant-no one moved, no one breathed. But Alexia didn't blink. She Looked up at him, all composed, and said with a light smile, "Can we talk?"



Waylon's eyes narrowed. A slow, unreadable smile tugged at his lips. "Talk about what?"



The tension was thick enough to choke on. Even Ada Looked like she was about to say something,but Korbin quietly held her back with a hand on her arm.


Alexia stayed calm, letting the silence stretch for another moment. Then, with a gentletilt of her chin,she said, "Let's talk inside. It's freezing out here, don't you think,Wally?"



The reaction was immediate, like tossing a spark into a pool of gasoline.


Gasps erupted through the crowd, disbelief spreading like ripples on water.



"Wait,did she just call him Wally?"
"Who is she? And how does she have the guts to call him that?"



"She said it like it was normal. And look at him-he's not even mad. What even is their relationship?"



Even Elton and Korbin exchanged looks, both taken aback.





Damn! Alexia still knew exactly how to manipulate Waylon.
###Chapter 13 The Payment Is You
Years had passed since Alexia last called Waylon by that old nickname. Back then, neither of them saw the other as an enemy.



Alexia embodied sweetness itself-charming, soft in every word,always glued to his side. Waylon, on the other hand, built walls as high as his ego. Untouchable.Admired and envied in equal measure.



A silent moment stretched out as Waylon simply watched Alexia, his gaze drifting over every detail.


Attention to her looks had always come naturally for Alexia. She never missed a chance to turn heads,and today, she did just that. The cold seemed to bother everyone but her. Draped in a fitted evening gown,skin bared to the chill, she moved with an effortless grace, her bare shoulders and elegant neckline drawing more than a few lingering stares.



Waylon remained unmoved. When no response came from him, Alexia's fingers slipped away, the light in her eyes dimming to a believable sorrow-a vulnerability so convincing it left the onlookers shifting uncomfortably.

Turning to go, she barely made it a step before Waylon's voice cut in, cool as ever.ome with me."


Alexia stopped short. The crowd's breath caught and then spilled out all at once.



Off to the side, Elton let out a weary sigh. It was always the same. Waylon never saw through her tricks,always ready to spoil her.



With effortless grace, Alexia turned back, the hint of a smile on her lips. No words were needed as a heavy coat settled across her shoulders, radiating Waylon's warmth.



For a moment, her hands tightened around the fabric,a tiny reaction betraying her calm, and she lifted her gaze to meet his eyes.



Words weren't needed. She understood, and with a quiet assurance, slipped into place at his side. Elton shifted away, giving her space to stand close.



Inside the club's upper lounge, the group took their seats. They had the best view, overlooking a crowd gathering for the city's annual equestrian and shooting competition.



Excitement buzzed through the room as Alexia glanced toward Waylon. "Wally, did you put your money down? You know everyone's picking either Black Mamba or Royal Lion. Which one's yours?"



Not once did Waylon meet her eyes, his attention fixed on the arena. His reply was flat. "Since when did you get to call me that? We don't exactly have that kind of relationship."


The sweetness in her voice didn't waver. "Isn't that what we're here to figure out? Maybe we're closer than you think."



Waylon's gaze sharpened as he studied her enthusiastic demeanor with quiet suspicion. "We're anything but close."



Alexia tipped her head, laughter in her eyes. "Give it forty-eight hours. We'll see how close we get."



Clearly done with her playful needling, Waylon nudged the conversation back to the present. "I haven't made my pick yet for the finals. Tell me,do you have a tip?"



A spark lit up in Alexia's eyes as she grinned with a playful edge. "Simple. Put your money on me."



That answer made Waylon's eyebrows flicker upward,if only for a moment.



"Choose me,Waylon."



A hush swept through the lounge, leaving only the sound of puzzled whispers and curious stares.
Weren't these two just trading flirtatious remarks? Now she wanted in on the contest herself? Nobody could keep up.



Waylon shot her a sharp look. "You're not listed as a participant."



"Plenty of time before things get started. Slpping another name onto the roster isn't exactly a hassle."Alexia let her gaze land on Elton, a hint of challenge in her smile. "As the club's biggest shareholder, I'm sure Elton has the final say."



Lounging comfortably, Elton let out a laugh, more than happy to watch the back-and-forth unfold."Depends-only if Waylon's on board."



There was not a flicker of doubt in Alexia's smile.win? Think of it as my gift for you."



Waylon's brow arched slightly, mild curiosity surfacing beneath that usual cool exterior. "So, what's the price tag for betting on you?"



"Every last cent," she answered, clear and unflinching.



That boldness pulled the air out of the room. Stunned looks bounced between Elton and Korbin, while Ada's hand flew to her lips, eyes huge with shock.



Had Alexia really just thrown that down-right in front  of Waylon?



Elton just grinned, clearly relishing the chaos. "Pretty sure I've never seen anyone so sure of themselves."



Alexia retorted, "Not just talk-check my track record.I only play for stakes that matter. The rest? Not worth my time. Are you worried the risk is too much for you,Waylon?"



For a moment, nobody spoke. The tension ratcheted higher. Ada sputtered on her drink, shocked beyond words.



No way-was Alexia really baiting Waylon out in the open like this?



Korbin glanced nervously between the two, struggling to guess what Waylon would do next. Surely he wouldn't bite at such a blatant dare.



However, a slow smile crept onto Waylon's lips."Match her bet," he said, his voice dropping to a command.



People scrambled to follow his order.



Before anyone caught their breath, Waylon leaned forward,voice steady but laced with a hint of menace."But if you lose, Alexia, the payment is you."



The words hit like a jolt, and suddenly, everyone in the  room could sense the shift in the air.



Alexia's heart stumbled. "And what exactly does winning me entail?"
###Chapter 14 Black Swan
Nothing in Waylon's face gave away a hint of mercy His voice cut through the stillness, cool and measured."Five years. You work for me. For Free."


The air in the room seemed to freeze.



Naturally, only Waylon would twist a simple wager into a five-year sentence. That was the signature move of Afoross's own financial predator.



No argument left Alexia's lips. Without a word, she followed the club staff to sign up, scrawled her name on the paperwork, and disappeared into the changing room.



Not Long after, an event official at the registration desk stopped cold, his eyes glued to the list.



There it was: Black Swan. The name hit like a jolt of electricity.



Black Swan was a legend who had blown away the national scene half a decade ago. Ten shots in thirty seconds. Perfect score. Then she dropped off the face of the earth. No press. No competitions. Not a whisper since that day.
Probably a fluke. Just someone else using the name.



A little later, Alexia stepped into the hallway outside the locker room.



Her new look turned heads-a crisp, custom riding suit cut to perfection, a shadowy cowboy hat drawn low and a black mask obscuring her eyes. Even so, her poise and the sharp line of her jaw made her impossible to miss.



Inside the exclusive lounge, Elton cut Waylon a skeptical glance. "Tell me you didn't put everything on her."



For years, the city's elite used the club as a playground. Rich folks threw down outrageous bets,ran their own contests, and nobody blinked. This year,though, everyone had their eyes on Royal Lion and Black Mamba-the two top contenders out for the title.



"What, you have doubts about her?" Waylon replied in an even, careless tone.



Korbin leaned back, not even pretending to be impressed. "Not my money on the line. I'm covering both Black Mamba and Royal Lion-can't lose that way."



Ada rolled her eyes, patience thin. "Come on. Alexia's

going to surprise everyone. I'm backing her all the way."



Korbin let out a laugh, short and sharp. "Royal Lion and Black MMamba have crushed every challenger for the past two years. Alexia? She's a total unknown."



Right then, the digital display above the arena pulsed to life, pushing out one name in giant white letters-Black Swan.



A vivid animation splashed across the screen: masked rider,hat low, every inch an enigma straight out of a blockbuster film.



For a second, Korbin lost his swagger. None of this sat right with him.



On the other side,Alexia joined the other competitors,moving into the waiting area.



Anyone hoping to master mounted archery needed nerves of steel and the hands of a surgeon. That challenge doubled with the underground circuit's mixed roster-Alexia was the only woman facing down a lineup of men.



The crowd couldn't help themselves-conversations buzzed the moment she appeared.



"Hold up-she's here as Black Swan? That takes guts,honestly."
"Anyone got a clue who Black Swan actually is?"


"All I know is five years ago, she became a myth. Ten flawless shots in thirty seconds, broke every record.Then-poof-gone."



"Is it really her back out here?"



"Come on, you really buy that? Feels like one of those overblown rumors. There's no real evidence,just wild stories."



"Say that again and see what happens!"



Spectators nearly came to blows, security barely keeping the peace as debate threatened to boil over.



Nearby, Royal Lion and Black Mamba, both well-known veterans, exchanged a brisk handshake before giving Alexia a look that said she was invisible.



Black Mamba's sneer traveled over her with open scorn. "Nice try with the dramatic alias. Black Swan's old news. You're in the wrong place."



Royal Lion didn't bother hiding his disdain. "Why are we even wasting time? Fame-chasers come and go.Even if she's that Black Swan, one lucky streak in a backwoods tournament isn't the same as dominating here. Women never break records in this arena."

Alexia crossed her arms, her mouth curling into a smile as sharp as broken glass. "How about a little wager? If I take first place, anytime my name shows up on the roster, both of you sit out. When I'm in the game,you're not invited. Understood?"



Royal Lion bristled, scowl deepening. "You're delusional." He made a move, but Black Mamba held him back, locking eyes with Alexia, curiosity flickering beneath the surface.



"Win or lose, you've already turned this into a spectacle. But hey, we'll gladly watch you go down in flames.Even if you really are Black Swan-after today,we'll make sure you never step foot in this sport again."
###Chapter 15 The Thumbs Down
Alexia gave a short laugh, shaking her head as if she couldn't believe what she was hearing. "Never step foot in this sport? Please. The weaker the man, the more fragile his ego."



Her words landed like a slap, and both men's faces turned stormy with anger.



This year's tournament wasn't for the faint of heart.The format had been revamped, harsher than ever-competitors had to handle both revolvers and shotguns. It was high-speed, high-risk, and brutally unforgiving.



The rules were simple but savage. Contestants had to ride at full gallop,weaving through a zigzag of barrels,firing ten shots-five from each weapon-while staying balanced, composed, and deadly accurate. The winner? Whoever had the cleanest, fastest run.



Black Mamba and Royal Lion entered the arena one after the other. Mamba broke his own record with a time of 52.05 seconds, while Lion cracked under pressure, missed a target, and ended with a frustrating 60.17.
"Mamba's on fire today-broke his record!"



"Lion flopped hard. One mniss and he's out."



"Wait a sec-who the hell is that? Look!"



The big screen zoomed in on Alexia as she rode into the arena, fast and fierce. From the second she appeared,every head turned.



Her first shot came mid-air as her horse leaped. In one smooth motion, she switched guns, firing two spot-on rounds in less than a second. She weaved around the barrels like she'd been born doing it. Her aim, her posture-everything about her was wild grace sharpened to perfection.



The crowd went dead silent as she neared the last target.



However, just then, a piercing whistle rang out from the audience. Her horse flinched hard, panic surging through its body as it suddenly veered off, nearly throwing her off balance.



The crowd sucked in a collective gasp. Ada's voice broke through, angry and sharp. "You've got to be kidding me.Who the fuck whistled? That's not even her horse; it's borrowed! Someone's trying to sabotage her!"

Waylon didn't blink. His eyes stayed locked on Alexia as she fought to get her horse back under control.


Just as the horse was about to crash into the barrel,Alexia reacted fast. She held on tight with her legs,leaned close to the saddle, and kept a steady grip on the reins. In one smooth move, she lifted the shotgun.As the horse jumped over the barrel, she turned slightly, aimed, and pulled the trigger. The shot echoed like thunder.



Her bullet tore through the target dead-on. And somehow, it felt like the whole crowd got hit too,straight in the chest.



The arena went wild.



Ten shots. Thirty seconds. Clean.



For a moment, silence settled and then came the roar of pure disbelief.



"Thirty seconds? No way-no one's that fast!"



"She destroyed Royal Lion's score!"



"That's Black Swan! It's her-has to be!"



There was a moment of shock, and then the crowd exploded. Cheers and chants thundered through the stands. "Black Swan! Black Swan!" Her name echoed like a wave crashing through the arena.



Up on the viewing deck,Korbin turned and gave Ada a sharp look. She was still catching her breath from all the cheering, her cheeks glowing with excitement.



"You knew she was Black Swan, didn't you? Why the hell didn't you warn me?" he snapped.



His heart sank just thinking about the bet he'd placed.His wallet was officially doomed.



Ada lifted both hands, feigning total innocence."Don't give me that look! I had no clue she was Black Swan! If I did, trust me-l'd have gone all in!"



Korbin turned his irritation to Waylon, only to be met with indifference. The man didn't even look his way.His eyes were locked on the arena, his expression unreadable, carved from stone.



With nowhere else to aim his anger, Korbin turned it on Elton.



Elton chuckled, unbothered as usual. "What can I say?She's the real deal. If it makes you feel better, your sister placed her bet on Black Swan too. So technically, your family's not taking a total loss."



Korbin just stared at him, clearly not amused and even more annoyed than before.
The noise from the crowd reached a fever pitch as Alexia strode confidently toward the podium.



As she stepped up, both Black Mamba and Royal Lion came forward, extending their hands in a show of sportsmanship,cameras flashing from all directions.



Alexia didn't even glance at them. She breezed past,leaving their outstretched hands dangling in the air while whispers rippled through the stunned crowd.



Black Mamba's eye twitched slightly as he slowly pulled his hand back, clearly trying not to lose face."Didn't expect this. You're really Black Swan,huh?"



Alexia's face stayed cold. "Just keep in mind what l said earlier. When I'm in the game, you're not invited."



Black Mamba clenched his jaw. "Is there really no room to work something out?"



She tilted her head slightly, her smile light but sharp."Of course there is. Just kneel and beg, both of you."



Royal Lion exploded. "You arrogant bitch! Who do you think you are?"



He barely finished the sentence before security pounced, pinning him face-first into the dirt like they'd rehearsed it.
Alexia gave him a sweet, mocking smle, raised her thumb,then slowly turned it down in a gladiator style
###Chapter 16 Who's The Lucky Guy
Anger painted Royal Lion's cheeks, his body twisting in a useless struggle against the guards holding him down.



"Bitch,what exactly do you think you're showing cff?"he roared, voice cracking with fury.


Before the Last word faded, Alexia's pabm comnacted with his face, delivering a stnging shap


The sharp smack rang ouit, stardling the orilonikers and drawing involuntary wincos


Frozen in disbelief, Royal Lion touchod Pis fnmming cheek, completely dumbfounded. "Did yom just siap me?"



A smirk tugged at Alexia's lips. "You think runníng your mouth makes you special? f'il take a swing at anyone I please. Maybe you should blame your father for not gatting clipped, or maybe he just couldn't afford proper birth control. That's probably why the world's got to put up with trash like yOu."



Sharp words were Alexia's weapon of choice. Years of clashing with Waylon had honed them into blades.
 Each insult landed like a punch, tearing through Royal Lion's fragile pride



Hurniliation welled in his eyes, anger mixing with tears."Did everyone hear that? Is no one going to say anything? What the hell is this?



Unmoved, the guards tightened their hold and hauled him off, his kicks missing their mark. his screams drowned by the audience's munmurs.


Alexia barely spared him another glance.a soft laugln escaping as she fixed hor ttmre on Black lMantba "Are you planning to throw a fit ap waill?"


The question rattled him. He forcag orlt a dirgil morie chuckle, his swagger gome, and mamde Hnimocili bc제Cはbefore she targeted him too


Normally, the press would've swarmed an like vultuies Two top-tier fighters getting humbled an tront of ācrowd? That kind of chaos fed headlines for weeks But not today Today. the spotlight belonged to someone else. Every lens zoomed in on Alexia-on Black Swan.



"Black Swan, would you consider taking off your mask for us?"



Without missing a beat,Alexia reached up and lifted her mask away Her face appeared on the arena's giant screen,dazzling the audience and sending a shockwave of excitement through the stands.



"Damn, she's breathtaking!"



"Look at her! All those fools who said Black Swan kept her face hidden because she was plain? Show yourselves and eat your words!"



"She's absolutely stunning... and tough as nails. If she asked me, I'd marry her right here and now."



Veteran journalists, seasoned as they were, found themselves at a loss, momentarily dazzled by her appearance.



One of them said, "You're breathtaking, Black Swan.Could you share with us what inspired your comeback this season? There were plenty of whispers that you'd stepped away for good."



Eyes drifting down to the gold trophy resting in her grip,Alexia let a secretive grin flicker across her lips She glanced up, letting the cameras capture every glint of purpose in her eyes. "I made a vow to hand this trophy to someone special."



The crowd erupted like a struck match, gasps and exclamations echoing around the arena.
"Who's it for?"



"Who's the lucky guy?"


"So she really came back after all this time just to claim victory for someone else?"


"This guy must have the best luck on the planet!"


Roars from the stands thundered so loudly the whole place seemed to tremble. High above, every spectator craned their necks toward Waylon, the one man who sat there cool as ice.



Sensing all eyes boring into his back, Waylon turned with unhurried calm. "Is there a reason you're all staring at me?"



Not a soul dared to answer. Instead, they dropped their gazes, suddenly fascinated with the floor.



His face revealed nothing, but the faint smile tugging at his lips didn't go unnoticed by anyone.



Heading off the track, Alexia's attention snagged on a target display set up at the center.


Five neat holes, each one dead center. The shooter must've been nothing short of a master.



The staff member trailing beside her lowered his tone and filled her in. "That was Mr. Mason, doing some  test shots before the show started."



Those perfect shots had impressed the manager so much, he practically treated the target like a sacred artifact. Hoping to win favor with Waylon, he refused to take it down.



Interest flickered across Alexia's face. She stopped and tossed the golden trophy into the staffer's waiting hands. "Hand me a pistol."



Scrambling, the man nearly dropped the trophy but managed to hand her the weapon.



Meanwhile, not a single camera inside the arena missed her next move. The giant screen filled with her image as she stepped into the same spot where Waylon had stood before.



With steady hands, she aimed and squeezed off five shots in a row. Every single one found the center-ten rings, just like before.



Spectators fell silent as they realized what had just happened-her bullets had slipped neatly through the very holes Waylon had left behind. Each shot was intentional, perfectly lined up, and executed with the precision of a master.



Although the target had absorbed ten rounds, it looked untouehed-still marked by only five holes.
Up in the luxury suite, silence hung thick as everyone stared,too shocked to speak.


Waylon, lounging on the sofa with his usual careless air,suddenly straightened, the amusement in his eyes shifting to something far more attentive-something close to admiration.



A low whisper broke the tension as Korbin leaned in."So... are you sure she just wants to chat?"


With that kind of marksmanship, coming to kill him seemed far more likely.


"That's what makes her interesting," Waylon answered with a slow, amused smile.



The rest of the group shared a look, unable to argue.



No one but Waylon Mason would ever use the word "interesting" for a woman like her.



When Alexia finally returned, trophy tucked under one arm, she found the lounge abandoned-except for Waylon.



He lounged on the red sofa, exuding confidence and an easy, animal grace. As she stepped in, hetipped his chin, inviting her to join him.


Taking the seat beside him, Alexia glanced around the  room. "Where is everyone else?"
###Chapter 17 You Didn't Seriously Think I Was Ab...
Waylon glanced up, his stare steady as a mountain stream. "I prefer peace and quiet when I'm negotiating.Is that going to be a problem?"


Alexia shook her head. "I have no objections to silence."



Her fingers moved to peel away the black mask,unveiling features that turned heads for all the right reasons. Dark hair spilled around her shoulders, and with every subtle movement, the scent of cherries drifted closer-one he'd never forgotten.



"This year, the sponsors pulled out all the stops. Solid 24-karat gold. Not bad, huh?" Alexia passed the trophy to him with a grin.



Waylon gave it a casual glance before saying, "What do you want from me?"



The warmth vanished from Alexia's face as she shifted into a businesslike manner. "This weekend's charity banquet held by the Chamber of Commerce. I need your help getting the Adam's Heart."


Waylon's gaze grew keen, eyes locked on her. "You're after the crown? Since when did that matter to you?"



Alexia answered smoothly, "It's not for me. A friend from Edevor has history with that crown. It used to belong to his family, handed down for generations,until life forced them to sell it off. Now that things are looking up for them, they're hoping to bring it back home."



Waylon's voice turned even colder, and a slight smirk formed on his lips. "This friend must mean a lot to you,if you're pulling strings for him."1


"That's right; we're close," said Alexia without hesitation.





"Did you get to know him from that trip to Edevor,five years back?"



"Uh-huh," she answered vaguely.



"Andre Cooper was there too?"



"Wait-what?"



Caught off guard, Alexia blinked, surprised at his sudden leap to Andre.



The silence stretched for a mnoment, then Waylon rose from his seat, face unreadable. For a heartbeat,she thought he was finished with her, and she quickly moved to block his way. "Look, I'm only doing him a  favor. If you don't like what I'm offering, just tell me what it'll take-"



Waylon cut her off, "Still rushing things, aren't you?"


Still as a statue, Alexia barely reacted. Moments later,the measured sound of Waylon's shoes filled the space, closing in on her at a pace that left no room for escape. She couldn't help staring as his sharply cut features came into view, every step bringing him closer.


Her heart skipped, and instinctively, she stumble back,Landing unceremoniously onto the sofa behind her.



Any hope of regaining her composure vanished as Waylon placed one hand firmly on the back of the couch, leaning in with all the confidence of a wolf.The air around her seemed to thicken with his presence.



A wicked smile played on his lips while his gaze hovered over her mouth. "Given our strained relationship, what makes you think you hold enough cards to sway me? Why don't you take a shot at guessing what I'm after."



His stare bore down on her. Thoughts tangled in Alexia's mind. Was he getting back at her?



Forcing herself to remain steady, she called up the most diplomatic smile she had. "I used to be reckless and competitive-always chasing after you. I'm past that now."



His answer was a quiet, mocking laugh, proof that he didn't buy a word of it.


That laugh unsettled her more than she wanted to admit.



His eyes caught hers, chilly and gleaming. "If you hadn't gone out of your way to show off with those five perfect shots at the range, I might almost take you at your word."



A pang of regret twisted inside her.



No matter how hard she tried, she just couldn't break her habit of turning every moment into a contest with him.



He continued to watch her, gaze unwavering and thoughtful. "Alexia, there's no apology needed. And don't try to change for anybody."


His words hit her like a pebble dropped into a pond,the impact spreading ripples through the calm she fought so hard to keep.


Her eyes found his, drawn in despite herself. That look -so deep and captivating-left her feeling exposed,and for one heart-stopping instant, she could hardly breathe.
She tried to blame the way the shadows played acrosS his face. Or maybe it was just the face itself. It had to be. There was no other reason her heart would hammer so wildly just because he inched a bit closer.


Her mind went blank. Heat crept up her cheeks, and even without a mirror, she could imagine the flush painted across her skin.



For a heartbeat, their breaths mingled, the distance barely existing at all. She froze, lost for how to act or what to say.



But the tension vanished in an instant as Waylon drew away,his laughter low and sly.



"You didn't seriously think I was about to kiss you, did you?" he teased with a chuckle.
###Chapter 18 It Doesn't Mean I'll Lose
Alexia's smile faltered into something tight and forced,then she clenched her jaw. "Forget everything I just said. I take it all back.Waylon,you-"


"I'Ll win the Adam's Heart for you."



Her words froze mid-air, and her eyes narrowed in suspicion."That's a sudden change of heart, don't you think?"



Waylon gave a calm nod, as unbothered as ever. "But it comes with a condition."



Alexia stiffened slightly. "Say it."



There was a pause. Then, Waylon said casually, "That night, you'll be mnine."







"What? Waylon asked you to be his date?"



The second Alexia stepped outside the club, Ada was already there waiting, and the moment she heard what happened inside, she practically leapt out of her heels.
Alexia remained cool. "That was all his call. He said I'd be staying beside him during the charity gala as his date. I warned him my reputation's in ruins, but he didn't seem to mind."



Ada quickly yanked her into a corner and whispered urgently, "Alexia, listen-Waylon has never brought a woman to an event like this. Not once. And this gala?It's not just another high-society cocktail party. It's a big deal. I'm seriously worried he's setting you up for something."



Alexia lifted an eyebrow. "Setting me up? Wow. You make it sound like you're scared of him."



Waylon had always been distant, frosty even-a total iceberg since they were kids. But Alexia had never seen Ada this shaken before.



Ada hesitated, wrestling with her thoughts, before sighing like she'd finally given in."Don't you think he's different now?"



"Yeah. Taller. More attractive. Definitely aged like fine wine." Alexia nodded.



Ada rolled her eyes hard. "You're hopeless. Seriously.You'd follow a handsome guy off a cliff."


Alexia simply gave a casual shrug. "Handsome guys exist so we can enjoy the view, right?"

Ada let out a deep sigh. "All jokes aside, you need to hear this. It's official--Waylon's being positioned as the next president of the Chamber of Commerce. And trust me, the timing isn't random. Dane Warren was supposed to serve at least two terms. He had everything-experience, support, influence, but he was pushed out almost overnight. You really think he gave that up willingly? No chance. One by one,everyone connected to his camp has been quietly wiped out."



Ada shivered, goose bumps creeping up her arms."Anyone who picked the wrong side ended up in a terrible situation-some say even worse than dying.Even those who were once friendly with the Mason family weren't spared. It didn't matter how close you were or how much you pleaded. Waylon is ruthless.Sure, we come from powerful families, but that doesn't give us immunity. He's not someone to provoke, Alexia. Just promise me you'll be careful.Keep your distance, okay?"


Alexia stared at Ada's pale face, something unfamiliar twisting in her gut-an edge of worry she couldn't ignore.



Ada had always been fiery and untouchable growing up-spoiled rotten, guarded by her powerful family and that hawk of a brother, Korbin. Nobody had ever dared mess with her.
And yet now, she was intimidated by Waylon.


Alexia replied calmly, "If he's really as unstoppable as you say, staying out of his way might not change anything. Some things find you anyway."


Noticing how worried Ada looked, Alexia softened her tone. "Relax. Honestly, I'm not a big deal right now.The Jenkins and Gibson families don't hold much value for someone like him. And if this is a setup,let him try. He's not the only one who knows how to play the game. Just because he starts it doesn't mean I'll lose."



Ada looked at her with visible worry. "God, I really hope I'm just being paranoid."



Later that day, they drove to Afoross University.



Despite the bright sky, the air cut sharp and bitter-it was January at its harshest.



Ada parked close to the entrance, and the two walked the remaining stretch toward the university gates.



Near the gates, Alexia noticed a tall guy leaning against a wall, hands tucked in his hoodie pocket,headphones resting over his ears. His head was tilted back slightly, like he was half-asleep or maybe just soaking in the weak winter sunlight.

Ada waved as they approached. "Nolan! Over here!"


He straightened at her voice and strolled over with casual ease.



Ada jumped in with introductions. "Alexia, meet Nolan Hayes. He's in your department. One of those early-admission prodigies."



Alexia glanced him over. Lean frame, sharp features,fresh-faced with just enough cocky energy to give away his age. His student ID hung around his neck like a blinking neon sign. She raised a brow. "What are you,sixteen?"



Ada almost burst out laughing but quickly held it in,while Nolan stayed perfectly calm and replied in the driest tone imaginable, "I'm eighteen. Senior year."



"Right." Alexia's lips twitched, mildly amused at herself.





Nolan continued, "Professor Ellis said you'd be here today.Asked me to meet you."



Alexia gave a small nod, a smirk tugging at her lips."Alright, lead the way."



They walked across campus to a quiet little restaurant tucked just off the main quad.
Inside, Damon Ellis was already waiting, seated in a private booth.



He was dressed down in simple athletic wear, holding a mug like a man deep in his weekend routine. But the second Alexia stepped in, the energy shifted.



He set the mug aside and stood up, his demeanor sharpening as his gaze locked on her.
###Chapter 19 | Know You And Waylon Have History
Spotting the silvery strands in Damon's hair, Alexia felt a swell of emotion that words couldn't touch. Her greeting came out earnest and quiet.


A gentle smile broke across Damon's face, his eyes gleaming as memories came rushing back.


Alexia had always stood out as his brightest student.Years ago,learning she'd walked away from biology for marriage had left him simmering with disappointment.


Family mattered most to Alexia-sometimes to the point of obsession. That much, no one dared challenge.



That same devotion, however, left her wide open to disappointment.


With a light squeeze to her shoulder, Damon gave her a welcoming pat. "Glad to see you again. Let's eat."


He'd gone all out, ordering a spread of her favorites.Tasting the familiar díshes, Alexia felt a gentle warmth seep into her chest.
Not once had the Jenkins family shown this kind of care for her likes or dislikes. Funny-her old professor remembered better than any of them ever had.


Ada and Nolan settled quietly into their seats. They concentrated on their food, wisely steering clear of the exchange.


Breaking the comfortable silence, Damon leaned forward. "You wouldn't believe the excitement in Afoross these days. Conferences, research breakthroughs, new contracts-our institute just landed a series of major projects. All of them trace back to that thesis you published back in the day."


Alexia's fork paused midway, surprise freezing her hand. "That's a big compliment. Sounds like a lot on your plate, though."


A sharp snort escaped Damon. "Another reason I need you back in the lab. These aren't just any projects.What we're doing is about to shake up the whole field.It's a technologícal revolution, and you could be at the center of it."



Yet even his enthusiasm failed to move Alexia. She nibbled her food, unhurried. "I've been out of the biotech loop. At best,I could do a few guest lectures.That's all I'm willing to promise."



Finance had swallowed her life for two years now.

Saving the Jenkins family, salvaging their reputation -those had consumed every waking thought. Science belonged to another version of herself.



With a dramatic sigh, Damon tossed up his hands."You're downplaying your talent again! If you hadn't married that useless man, you'd be a leader in the field by now. Instead of wasting time in that joke of a marriage, you could have been making breakthroughs.You deserve better-good riddance to him."



Ada chimed in with a grin, "That's right! With Roger out of the picture, maybe you'll finally spot a decent guy. Prof. Ellis, you must know some decent bachelors. Maybe set her up?"


Damon chuckled, eyes twinkling. "Actually, I might.But only if she's willing to put herself back out there."



Alexia shook her head,putting an end to that line of talk. "Not interested. I have other things on my mind."



An eager gleam appeared in Damon's eyes. "Does that mean you're ready to come back to work?"



Caught beneath the weight of their eager stares,Alexia let out a resigned breath. "Alright. I'll come to work."



Delight danced in the professor's eyes as he snapped his fingers, barely able to contain his excitement."That's settled, then. By next month at the latest,I  want your paperwork done and your position official.Nolan, fetch the contract."



Without hesitation, Nolan reached over, unzipped his backpack, and produced a folder. He slid it and a pen smoothly across the table to Alexia.


Those graceful, deliberate movements gave Alexia the unsettling sense that this had all been arranged well in advance.



No sooner had she touched the pen than Damon leaned back with his coffee, his tone breezy. "And if you ever find yourself wanting to date again, maybe give Waylon a try."



Her grip faltered, pen nearly scrawling across the page."What?"



Damon's eyes glimmered with mischief. "Come on,you know what I'm talking about. I know you and Waylon have history. If he wasn't still holding out hope, would he have funneled all those prestigious research grants into our department? I've heard the gossip. It's obvious who he's hoping to impress."



The shock left Alexia frozen, a tangle of emotion knotting in her chest.


Had Waylon really been quietly involved in her life all this time?
Disbelief flashed across Ada's face. "You're kidding.That doesn't sound like him Waylon at all!"



With an indifferent shrug, Damon brushed it off."That's for you to worry about. Either way, the deal with the government's already in ink."


After the meal, Alexia and Ada made their way out together.



Damon stretched out on the couch, tossing a look Nolan's way. "So, what's it like meeting Alexia in person?"



Sliding the signed contract into his backpack, Nolan replied, "She's even more striking in real life than in the pictures."



A laugh erupted from Damon. "No surprise there.When she was still on campus, half the students were smitten. It's no wonder Waylon..." He stopped himself,then spoke with extra weight. "Things get messy at Afoross University. Keep an eye on her. Make sure nothing happens."



Nolan tugged his cap further down, his bag slung over one shoulder. "Relax. I won't let anyone mess with her."


Ada navigated the car through city traffic, taking Alexia home.

While they waited at a red light, Ada glanced over and caught Alexia typing rapidly on her phone. "Who's got your attention?"
###Chapter 20 Roger Got Into A Car Wreck

"Roger's a complete fool." Alexia spoke with an icy calm, but a hint of irritation slipped through. "I've begged for that divorce a hundred times. He dodges my calls, ignores every message... He could just disappear for all I care. It'd save everyone a headache."


Strangely enough, fate seemed to listen. That same night, Roger got into a car wreck. He was rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery.



Panic swept through the Gibson family. Even the old patriarch, Allen, fighting through aching joints and stubborn pride, found himself hobbling into the hospital long after midnight.



Marilee showed up not long after, conveniently crossing paths with the family. She wasted no time putting on a display of heartfelt concern, flitting around like she couldn't bear to leave Roger's side Watching from the sidelines, Gloria leaned closer to Allen and murmured, "Marilee's a lovely girl-polite,no drama, and her career's taking off. Since Roger's interested in her, why not give them your blessing?"



Allen slammed his cane on the floor, clearly irritated.
That's what's on your mind right now? There are bigger issues. Has anyone figured out how this crash happened? He was driving a brand-new Rolls-Royce,top of the line. How does a luxury car lose control,blow a tire, and slam into a guardrail? That doesn't just happen by chance!"


Gloria's expression turned serious. "We've already got people digging intoit."



While the family speculated, Marilee nervously paced the hospital corridor. Eventually, she took out her phone and called her mother.



"Mom, something's happened to Roger. The injuries Look bad. He probably won't be able to show up for the Chamber of Commerce's gala this weekend."



A heavy pause hung in the air before Evelyn finally replied, voice calm and measured, "Forget the gala Clear your schedule and stay with him. That's your only job now."


"Mom!" Marilee blurted out, frustration edging her tone, before quickly lowering her voice so others wouldn't overhear. "There are nurses watching him every second. He doesn't need me hanging around.I've barely rejoined the family, and if I don't go to that gala, no one will even remember | exist!"


Having grown up in another household, she had  always felt like an outsider since coming back, never quite fitting in with the city's elite.


The Jenkins family might wield power, but one name alone couldn't open every door in those social circles.



More and more, Marilee sensed invisible barriers hemming her in at every turn. That gala wasn't just another party; it might be the only way to finally get noticed.



Evelyn's tone stayed soft, almost soothing. "This isn't some weekend charity ball. Only the top of the top get invited. The Jenkins family was given a single invitation-your brother will be representing us."



Marilee pressed her lips together, fighting back disappointment. "Isn't there any way he can give me his spot?"



A cod pause followed, then Evelyn let out a short,humorless laugh. "You can't be serious. I've already done more than enough for you. From the beginning,I was against you and Roger. I worked nonstop to get Alexia paired off with him so you wouldn't waste your future.I warned you-set your sights higher. You're my only daughter; you should marry into one of the city's four major families, not cling to someone as useless as Roger. But you didn't listen. You fell for him before you even understood the consequences. Do you have any idea how much you've jeopardized your chances for a good marriage? And now you're still hung up on Alexia's ex?"



Marilee protested "But I love Roger-"


Evelyn cut her off coldly. "If you truly loved him, you wouldn't be begging me for a way into the gala. You'd be by his side right now, and that would be enough.But if you really want to move up in this world, you'll have to leave Roger. Otherwise, you're on your own."


Just like that, the call dropped without warning.



Marilee stood in the harsh fluorescent light of the hospital hallway, clutching her phone, resentment flickering behind her downcast eyes.


So be it. If no one was willing to lend a hand,she would carve out her own path.



Hidden within Afoross' most iconic district, the Orchid Estate belonged solely to Waylon. The property stood as a symbol of prestige, blending elegant design with unmatched convenience.



Upstairs, Waylon lounged alone in his study,lost in the pages of a book. A Siamese cat with striking blue eyes weaved between his feet, demanding attention. At first, Waylon paid no mind, but the cat persisted,nuzzling against his leg with growing determination.



Eventually,Waylon gave in, setting the book aside to lift the insistent feline into his lap. As he stroked its fur, the cat settled comfortably, purring in contentment.



A gentle knock broke the quiet.


"Come in," Waylon called out.


Simon Lyons, Waylon's assistant, entered the room."Sir, everything went as you directed. He's still alive-barely,but alive."



The cat shifted in Waylon's arms, blinking up at Simon and letting out a soft meow. Waylon offered a distracted nod, then spoke with a casual air. "Send an invitation to the Braxton family for the Chamber of Commerce's gala."



Simon hesitated. "The Braxton family? After their falling-out with the Gibson family,they lost nearly everything. They're barely scraping by, and rumor has it, they're planning to leave Afoross for good.If they do turn up at the gala, it's unlikely they'll get a warm reception."



Waylon's gaze flickered upward, cool and unwav/ering "Leaving Afoross? Did I give them permission to leave?"


Simon fell silent,uncertain. Waylon leaned back, voice light yet chilling. "Hand the invitation to Matteo Braxton personally. Whether the Braxton family makes it through this or not-that'll be up to him."
###Chapter 21 Petty And Scheming

Simon gave a quick nod but lingered in the doorway,looking uncertain about leaving.


"Something else on your mind?" Waylon asked.


Simon steadied himself with a slow inhale. "This evening makes it the third time your grandfather has asked you to come back for dinner."


A cool, almost mocking laugh slipped from Waylon when he heard this.



Simon's posture grew stiff. He stayed rooted to the spot. A silence lingered between them until, at last,Waylon's steady voice broke through. "Just ignore him."



"Understood, Mr.Mason!"


Simon's answer rang out, and he left the room with respect, though the feeling of uneasiness trailed after him like a stubborn echo.


Back inside, the cat had grown tired of all the attention and wriggled in Waylon's hold, hoping for freedom.


Waylon didn't let it go so easily, and the creature responded by swatting at his hand. Only then did the cat use its nimble legs to leap out of his arms,landing with grace and pride before marching back to its own corner.


Witnessing such boldness from the cat, Waylon was reminded of Alexia, feeling both frustrated and amused. "You really do have a temper."


Meanwhile, Ada had just dropped Alexia at the hotel.She eyed the place with clear displeasure."Are you seriously planning to stay here? Come on, you could stay in one of my apartments."


Alexia shook her head. "Thanks, but I'm not struggling for a place. The hotel is just for now. I was weighing my options, and now that I'm set on joining Afoross University, I'll be moving over to Newhall

The mention of Newhall Garden worked some of the tension out of Ada's face. "So, how much did Roger actually hand over after the divorce?"


Alexia simply lifted a finger.


Ada's brows knitted together. "You got a hundred million?"



Alexia let out a dry laugh. "With two properties way out by the city limits, the total is barely ten million."


Ada cursed under her breath, "That's pathetic! Isn't he afraid of being laughed at? Is this all the heir of the Gibson family can offer? He's so cheap! That Newhall Garden place didn't come from him, did it?"


Alexia replied, "No, I bought it."


Ada let out a breath of exasperation. "You let him off too easy. If I were you, I'd drag Roger to court for a proper split. The Gibsons are rolling in money!Letting Roger walk away like this is a gift he doesn't deserve."
A hint of amusement crossed Alexia's lips as she thought back. "Roger had me sign a prenuptial agreement before we ever got married. Honestly,I thought it was all pretty ridiculous at the time."


Money had never been a concern for her, so she never cared much for Roger's fortune. She could only laugh at his habit of being so careful with money.


Ada's outrage spilled over. "He's unbelievably small-minded! Trying to cling to every coin he has! Alexia,why didn't you stand your ground and secure more for yourself?"


For a moment, Alexia just stared ahead before replying, "Maybe everyone was right about me.Maybe I was out of mny mind. After all those years-Roger, the Jenkins family-I let myself fade into the background. It's almost funny, isn't it?"


Sympathy flickered in Ada's eyes. "Don't talk like that. Those days are behind you now."


A new resolve showed in Alexia's expression.


 "Exactly. It's finished. So, Ada, you don't need to worry. Whatever Roger kept from me in the settlement, I'll find a way to get it back somewhere else."


With time, she had come to know every corner of the Gibson empire, its tangled shares, its hidden cracks.


Missing out on Roger's assets meant little. The way their family business was structured, Roger's grip wasn't as tight as he liked to think. Real triumph would be claiming a piece straight from Gibson Group itself.


Relief washed over Ada at those words. "As long as you have a plan of your own, I'm happy. Once you get settled in your new place, ring me up. We'll celebrate.Deal?"


As Alexia nodded in agreement, Ada pressed the pedal and sped away in style.


Turning to the hotel, Alexia was just in time to catch sight of Travis Jenkins coming out, his arm looped around a woman.
Their eyes met, and aflicker of surprise passed over Travis' face. Noticing his sudden tension, the woman at his side cast Alexia a curious glance, her unease quickly rising.


Not hiding her suspicion, the woman tossed a hostile glare at Alexia. She leaned in close to Travis and whispered, "Do you know her? Is this someone you've been keeping from me?"


Before she could finish, Alexia's cold stare sliced through her, sending the woman shrinking closer to Travis.


Without a word of denial or comfort, Travis continued to stare at Alexia, his gaze heavy with meaning. "So you're not even going to say hello?"
###Chapter 22 A Stroke Of Luck
Alexia kept her composure. "Tell me, what makes you think I owe you a greeting?"


Travis let out a laugh. "Still bitter, | see. You can sulk all you want, but nothing you do will change the truth. Marilee is my real sister, not you. No amount of envy can erase that."


He tossed a glance across the lobby and added,"Now that the Gibsons have thrown you out, a hotel is the only roof you have. Honestly, I almost feel sorry for you."


His performance didn't draw any response from Alexia. She simply studied him, unimpressed.


Of all the Jenkins siblings, Travis stood out as the unpredictable one. His love for chaos and the dramatic ran deeper than anyone realized.


From the start, he had gone out of his way to ruin anything she cared about. Dolls were ripped to shreds, her kitten never escaped his torment, snakes found their way into her desk, and once, he even poured acid into her milk. Afterwards, he would put on that mask of innocence and ask, "Aren't you going to cry?"


Travis only grew more excited when she stayed silent. He fished a card from his wallet, flashed a sly grin, and said, "Look, I can be generous. Act a little friendly, and this card is yours. Spend as much as you like."



The woman at his side looked stunned. Jealousy flickered in her eyes.


To anyone watching, Travis looked like the picture of a doting brother.


Alexia knew better, though. That act was just for show. And beneath that surface, madness simmered.


Alexia eyed the card, then asked, "What's the limit on this one? Ten million?" Travis wore the same easy smile.


"Maybe a hundred million?"


Still, his look stayed the same.


"Let me guess. A billion?"


That did it. The smile wavered, his face tightening at last.



Matching his grin, Alexia replied, "So, you think a card loaded with a billion is supposed to impress me?"



That single line cracked the charm Travis wore so well.


An uneasy silence hovered between them. Travis'companion caught sight of his clenched fist, the veins standing out, and she shrank back, frozen by fear.



His eyes locked onto Alexia, clearly agitated by the brightness of her smile-a smile he had always loathed.
 What Travis really wanted was to drag her through the dirt, to break her, to watch her beg. Her pain was his twisted reward.



But Alexia only smiled, refusing to let him have that satisfaction.She would never bend.



"You look down on me?" he asked.


With an arch of her brow, she retorted, "How can l respect a man who failed to defend his own inheritance?"


All color drained from his face. "You found out?"


She had already heard that the Jenkins successor had been chosen and that Zayne would represent them at the upcoming gala.


Alexia made no attempt to deny it. "Travis, ever wondered why you lost out?"


For a heartbeat, he almost looked hopeful.


"Because you're broken inside."


The words hit harder than any blow, reaching right into the heart of him.


He'd spent years pretendinng, but Alexia had seen through every layer.


A bitter laugh burst from Travis, cold enough to chill everyone nearby. The woman by his side went rigid,fear etched across her face.



"You really believe this is the end for me? Alexia,you'll pay for this.I swear it."


He wouldn't admit defeat yet.


With a light shrug, Alexia remarked, "Well, we'll see how this plays out. If you try anything, I'll just have Zayne handle you himself."


Catching sight of the storm brewing on Travis' face,she turned on her heel, feeling pleased.


Some people made provoking them far too effortless.


Later, sprawled across her hotel bed, Alexia glanced at her phone. Roger's chat window remained stubbornly silent, as usual.
Maybe he really had dropped off the face of the earth.


The encounter with Travis had already put her in a foul mood, and Roger's ghosting only added fuel to the fire. Irritation mounting, she began dialing his number repeatedly. At last, someone picked up.


Without skipping a beat, she taunted, "Roger, have you died or something? Because if so, just let me know. No replies to my texts or calls-how are we supposed to finalize this divorce? And how long do you plan to let Marilee hang around as your mistress?"



Before she could say anything more, Gloria's furious voice exploded from the speaker. "What are you saying? How dare you speak like that? Roger's in the hospital, barely alive after a car crash! He hasn't woken up, and you're here cursing him?"


Alexia blurted out, "Roger crashed his car? Well,that's a stroke of luck."


Gloria lost control. "You heartless woman! No wonder Roger wants nothing to do with you. Marilee is a thousand times better than you. Just so you know, l never liked you and I never will!"


Alexia remained perfectly calm, barely paying attention to the tirade. She even queued up an upbeat song and held the phone close to the speaker. The sound of the cheerful melody sent Gloria into hysterics.
###Chapter 23 Waylon Had Indeed Changed
Alexia didn't give Gloria a chance for another word.She ended the call with a quick tap.


A satisfied hum escaped her as she headed for the shower,feeling victorious.


Once she finished, she reached for her towel and began drying her hair. That was when her phone buzzed insistently on the bedside table.


She reached for it, noticing a notification on the screen.



A message popped up from Monica Wallace at AMOS Gallery. "Sirius? Please, get back to me! It's urgent."


Alexia replied in confusion, "What's the emergency?"


"Thank goodness you finally responded! The Chamber of Commerce just reached out to us.They've sent an invitation especially for you. They want Sirius-the genius painter-to attend their banquet."



Alexia answered, "You know I never show my face as Sirius. Sirius only exists for the art, nothing else."


Their relationship had always been straightforward and businesslike. She sent her paintings, signed the contracts, collected payments, and accepted the occasional trophy. Nothing more.



Something about this request set off an alarm in her mind.



She quickly asked, "You didn't say yes, did you?"


Monica replied right away, "Absolutely not! I know where you stand, but it's the Chamber of Commerce.Turning them down isn't so simple. That's why l thought-maybe we could submit one of your paintings for their charity auction. Showing your work is almost like you being there yourself."
Monica's meaning was obvious-a donation would help smooth things over.


Holding grudges wasn't Alexia's style. Even AMOS Gallery had to bow to the Chamber of Commerce.And with charity as the purpose, she saw no reason to refuse.



So she replied, "That's fine with me."


Relief poured out of Monica in the next message.


AMOS Gallery treated Sirius like their prized possession. Back when the gallery was staring bankruptcy in the face, a mysterious fourteen-year-old girl-Sirius-sent in her very first painting. That single artwork rescued the gallery from collapse.


Without Sirius, AMOS Gallery would have faded into obscurity long ago.


Time flew, and before Alexia knew it, the banquet held by the Chamber of Commerce had arrived.


Alexia intended to choose her own outfit, but Waylon had other plans, sweeping her away to an exclusive boutique filled with vintage gowns.


Surrounded by a row of stylists beaming at her, she felt a hint of nerves flutter in her chest-a feeling she rarely experienced.


Unlike the stylists, Waylon went straight to the point.Reaching for a sleek black feather gown, he offered her a gentle smile. "This one stands out to me.Would you mind wearing it?"


His unexpected warmth caught Alexia off guard.Waylon had indeed changed. There was a new ease in the way he smiled now. When making requests, his smile was flawless, making it nearly impossible to refuse.


"All right," Alexia answered, and with that, she took the gown and disappeared into the fitting room.


Once the final touch of makeup was applied, she stepped out, and every conversation in the boutique died on the spot.


Waylon's taste never missed the mark. The strapless black gown hugged her frame perfectly, turning her into something like a regal black swan-sophisticated and utterly mesmerizing.


The gown hugged her figure in all the right places,while the skirt floated with her everymove.Feathers and diamonds glinted under the lights, lending her a regal, almost otherworldly air.


To finish the look, the stylists swept her hair into a polished style, letting a few strands trail along her neck. The effect was hypnotic. Artistry met glamour,leaving her looking like a living masterpiece.


Exclamations of admiration burst from the stylists and designers. "Unbelievable! You're stunning! That dress could have been made for you!"


"Ms. Jenkins, may I get your contact details? I'd love to collaborate with you in the future!"



"Please, Ms. Jenkins, I'm in the photography business. My company's publications are well-known.Would you consider giving me your number?"
Overwhelmed by all the attention, Alexia glanced in Waylon's direction, hoping for a lifeline, but he simply watched,thoroughly entertained.


Left with no other option, she finally asked, "How do l look?"
###Chapter 24 The Woman Beside Waylon Was Alexia

It had been ages since Alexia last slipped into an evening gown. The feeling was strange, as if she had crossed over into a world where she didn't quite belong.


Waylon's eyes flickered with something he quickly concealed. With quiet sincerity, he told her, "You are absolutely breathtaking."


Those words caught Alexia off guard. For someone rarely flustered, she found herself fighting a faint blush. The room, once buzzing, fell into perfect silence.


Waylon gestured to his assistant, who appeared holding a velvet box. Inside, a sapphire necklace gleamed beneath the lights.


Linked gems formed a sparkling river, while tiny glass :vehicles lined the entrance. Guests glided past,dressed in glamour, the atmosphere pulsing with anticipation.


Marilee emerged from a polished car, gratitude in her smile as she turned to her companion. "Thank you so much for helping me tonight, Pierson. Without you,l wouldn't have even set foot at this event."



Pierson Simpson, a friend of hers, smiled warmly."You don't have to thank me, Marilee. I'm always here when you need me."


Marilee's lips curved into a sweet smile, a flicker of pride hidden in her eyes. "It's my first time at an event like this. I'll be relying on you all evening!"


Pierson offered a reassuring nod. "It's nothing.heard a bit about what's been happening in your family. Alexia is out of the picture now, isn't she?"


Marilee didn't hesitate. "That's right. She isn't my parents' real daughter. She had years of comfort and luxury, which should have been enough for her. If she stayed, where would that leave me? Nobody ever stopped to think about how I felt. It's just not right.Still, why are you asking about her all of a sudden?"


Brows knitted together, Pierson replied, "Something jogged my memory about her having ties to someone important at tonight's gathering."


That caught Marilee off guard. "You're talking about Waylon? How could Alexia have anything to do with him? Wasn't he overseas for years?"


Pierson explained, "My brother let it slip once.Apparently, before Waylon left the country, Alexia's name kept popping up in those exclusive circles."


A sharp laugh escaped Marilee. "Alexia? If she really had any pull in those circles..."


Surely, if that were the case, she never would have snatched Roger away from Alexia with such ease.


"Honestly, if she were so capable, society would have known her name ages ago. Alexia only manages to draw attention from men like Andre. She probably imagines she's irreplaceable, but in truth, everyone just sees her as a toy. She's chasing an impossible dream,thinking she could ever catch Waylon's eye!"


Marilee's tirade was cut short as a ripple of excitement passed through the crowd outside.


The arrival of four sleek Bentleys commanded attention, followed by eight men in black stepping out to form a perfect corridor. The assistant slid from the front seat, circled around to the back, and bowed deeply before announcing, "Mr. Mason."


A glimpse of tailored suit pants appeared first, and as the door opened wider, a strikingly handsome face emerged into the light.


Waylon stepped out first, immediately stealing the spotlight. Every eye in the plaza seemed drawn to him, as if the world itself tilted in his direction.


People around him naturally formed a circle of admiration, always careful to keep their distance yet unwilling to drift too far.


Marilee found herself unable to look away, caught up in the same magnetic pull as the rest of the crowd.


An unexpected gesture followed-Waylon reached back into the car, his movements polished and inviting.


A woman's hand slipped into his, feather-light and graceful.


The entire crowd seemed to pause, breathless with anticipation.


The next moment, Alexia emerged, draped in a black gown that shimmered under the lights. Shock rippled through the onlookers as they recognized her.


"Wait, is Waylon actually arriving with a female companion tonight? The woman with him is absolutely gorgeous!"


"Could she be an actress? But none of the invited guests were celebrities. Still, look at her! She and Waylon look incredible together!"


"I can't decide who I envy more right now, and that's the worst part!"
All around her, admiration filled the air, and Marilee felt her color drain. Her hands clenched tightly,nails pressing into her palms as disbelief and bitterness mingled in her chest. Seeing Alexia on Waylon's arm,bathed in the spotlight, felt like a dagger straight to her heart.


There was no mistake-the woman beside Waylon was Alexia.


###Chapter 25 | Hope She Has A Wonderful Evening

Was there any truth to what Pierson had said? Was there really some kind of history between Alexia and Waylon?


The question nagged at Marilee. Why would it be Alexia? What set her apart from everyone else?


No matter how hard she had worked for her invitation, all her efforts suddenly seemed laughable compared to Alexia, who now drew everyone's admiration without even trying.


Pierson couldn't hide his awe. "Waylon arrived with a companion tonight. Honestly, I can see why-she's stunning."


Silence wrapped around Marilee as she digested his comment.


Eventually, Pierson caught the strain in her expression. "Marilee, is something wrong? Do you happen to know who she is?"


A brittle smile broke through as Marilee replied,"She's Alexia."


That revelation seemed to catch Pierson off guard,but he let the matter rest.


Inside the banquet hall, floral scents mingled with the rustle of silk gowns and the soft clinking of glassware.


Carrie Kennedy approached Zayne and raised her glass in greeting. "Word is you pulled off a major deal overseas.Congratulations."


He met her toast with a modest smile. "That's flattering, but | wouldn't call it a major win. Let's just say I didn't return empty-handed."


Carrie laughed softly. "You always downplay your success. You're already quite accomplished. After all,no one can compare to Waylon."


At the mention of Waylon, Zayne's mood shifted, his expression turning thoughtful.


Within their generation, Waylon had always stood apart, his name carrying a certain weight.


Tonight, they had gathered for one purpose-to welcome Waylon back from abroad.


Carrie leaned in a bit closer. "If I remember right,there's a bit of history between your family and Waylon, isn't there? That goes back years-"


Zayne cut her off quickly. "That is ancient history.Truth be told, those days weren't exactly fond memories. Alexia always found a way to get under Waylon's skin, and he could barely tolerate her."


Carrie raised an eyebrow, clearly surprised. "Was Alexia really that fearless when she was little?"


For as long as anyone could remember, Alexia had stayed out of the spotlight for many years, rarely making appearances at social gatherings. Had Marilee's dramatic return not made headlines, most people would have forgotten Alexia altogether.
A shrug was all Zayne offered. "Boldness doesn't get you far if all it does is irritate people. Thankfully,she's not part of the Jenkins family anymore. If she were, I'd be stuck handling the fallout."


With a thoughtful swirl of her glass, Carrie kept pressing. "Still, the Jenkins family took her in for over twenty years. Why do you dislike her so much?Because she stirred up trouble as a kid?"


Zayne chose silence, refusing to revisit the subject.


Suddenly, the atmosphere at the banquet shifted as a disturbance rippled through the entrance.


The grand hall's chatter dropped off, all attention snapping to the doorway.


Waylon strode into the hall, Alexia by his side, both of them commanding attention.


Seeing the pair together sent a ripple through the crowd. Eyes followed Alexia, filled with interest and speculation.


Soft whispers drifted across the room, quiet but no less intense than those outside.



"Does anyone know who Waylon's companion is?She's stunning."


"Wait, is that Alexia?"


"Are you serious? Alexia? Wasn't she once married to Roger?"


"Can anyone explain what's going on? How did Alexia end up on Waylon's arm? What's the story between those two?"



Carrie shot a pointed look at Zayne, noticing the tension in his jaw. "Are you absolutely certain that Waylon could barely tolerate her?"


Had there truly been any animosity, Alexia would never have set foot inside, much less by Waylon's side.



On top of that, her divorce with Roger had been all over town. Who would risk inviting such controversy at an event like this?
The room seemed to pause, caught off guard by her poise.


Wasting no time, Bradly reached out his hand. "The pleasure is ours, Ms. Jenkins. We're honored you could join us."


Waylon's cool gaze swept the hall, and he spoke with a quiet authority. "Alexia is here as my guest. I hope she has a wonderful evening."


That single declaration sent ripples of shock across the room.
###Chapter 26 Welcome Back
Waylon's words sent a flutter through Alexia's chest,prompting her to glance his way and meet his eyes.


Their eyes met for a fleeting moment, and she quickly turned away, hoping no one would notice the flicker of nerves on her features.



Upon reaching a private lounge, Alexia settled into her seat and took in the arrangement around her.Never before had she witnessed so many heirs from distinguished families gathered in one place.



A pair of subtle nods from Elton and Korbin greeted her arrival.



Every person here carried the poise of old money,their watchful eyes quick to size up the room. It didn't take long for them to realize Alexia wasn't a stranger to influence, especially with her easy rapport with the heirs of the most powerful families.
With a sense of occasion, Elton lifted his glass in her direction. "It's good to see you back."


There was no mistaking the significance behind his words.


Glances full of recognition flickered around the room,and soon, everyone was joining Elton, lifting their glasses high.


"Welcome back!"


The room buzzed with genuine excitement, the greeting ringing out for her.


Such a reception left Alexia more than a little overwhelmed.



Waylon, on the other hand, stayed poised and unbothered, deftly guiding the energy in the room."Just juice for her this evening," he said smoothly.


That set off a ripple of friendly laughter and a round of winks among the guests.


"Looks like Waylon is keeping a close watch,"
someone teased.



Alexia just smiled, taking the good-natured teasing in stride.



"Let Alexia relax and have her fun."



"If juice is her drink of choice, that works for us. She can keep the mood, and we'll handle the liquor."


Watching the others sip their drinks, Alexia felt a wave of awkwardness wash over her. Under the scrutiny of Waylon's steady gaze, she picked up a glass of mild fruit wine and polished it off in one motion.



"Thank you." Alexia might have been proud, but she knew when to show respect. Good manners were never something she forgot.


Waylon wasted no time sliding her glass away."That's enough for tonight."


A small frown formed on Alexia's lips."You know,I can handle my drinks."
Waylon's lips curled in amusement, as if her claim was pure entertainment. "Is that so? Must be the same confidence people get when they're already tipsy."


He'd witnessed her inebriated before, and those episodes had been nothing short of a trial for him.


With one brow arched, Alexia asked him, "And what makes you think you know me so well?"


"Let's just say I've handled my share of some intoxicated troublemaker," Waylon replied, voice cool as ever.



Curiosity flickered in her eyes, but before Alexia could press further, several senior gentlemen approached in sharp suits. Waylon stood to greet them, exchanged a few formalities, then turned to Alexia. She nodded. "Go on. I'll be just fine here."


With Waylon mingling, the lounge kept its cheerful buzz. No one brought up the Gibson family,each guest careful to keep things smooth for Alexia.
Whenever Waylon's name popped up, Elton and Korbin made sure to keep the mood light, careful never to make her uncomfortable.



After a handful of lighthearted games, Alexia slipped away for a breath of air.


She found herself wandering into a quiet corridor,only to unexpectedly encounter Marilee, dressed in an elaborate embroidered gown.


As they brushed past each other, Alexia didn't so much as break stride, acting as though Marilee were invisible-until a firm voice stopped her in her tracks.


Marilee gave Alexia a slow, appraising look before breaking into a tight smile. "You've certainly found your way up the social ladder. I never pictured you clinging to Waylon's side. You must feel on top of the world making such a scene tonight, don't you?"


Not a flicker of emotion crossed Alexia's face. "It is pretty satisfying, actually. Why do you care?"


That blunt response brought a flash of anger to Marilee's eyes. "Enough with the act. Ever since you were tossed from the Jenkins family and dumped by Roger, you've been bitter. You couldn't stand losing your old life, so you threw yourself at Waylon. All this just for a littleattention and to prove you've still got backing,right?"


Alexia quirked a brow. "Sounds like you're jealous. Is that it?"



Her casual jab, delivered with cold precision, nearly sent Marilee over the edge.


Jealousy burned, no question about it.


But Marilee wasn't the only one. Alexia had become the object of envy for half the women in the banquet,all because she stood beside Waylon, bathed in admiration.



That realization made Marilee's sneer deepen."Don't let this go to your head, Alexia. Men like Waylon have women lined up for miles. It's only a matter of time before he gets bored. When he does, I can't wait to see you brought down a peg."
Any patience Alexia had was gone. "Well, you'll just have to wait and see for yourself."


Her cool dismissal left Marilee momentarily speechless, stung by the indifference.


Why did Alexia always act so untouchable?


What made Marilee so unworthy of even being considered her rival?



She seethed. How could a woman who'd been cast aside, who lost everything to her, still carry herself with such confidence?
###Chapter 27 | Call The Shots
Alexia didn't want to waste time with Marilee. "Step aside. I'm not here to play games with you."


Marilee was furious. "Where's that attitude coming from? Did you forget where you came from? You dare parade around after everything you've been through?Alexia, you're nothing but a fraud. You honestly believe you're-"


Alexia's hand shot out before the insult could land,fingers closing around Marilee's necklace.


The chain drew tight, yanking Marilee forwNard into a clumsy,humiliating bow.


Panic seized Marilee as the threat of choking drove every other thought from her mind.


Desperation flooded her expression as she looked up, only to find Alexia watching with a cold, almost taunting smile.
Completely in control, Alexia gave Marilee's cheek a gentle pat, as though scolding a stubborn child. "So you think you're superior? Funny, since you're the one bowing now. Maybe next time, you'll think before spouting nonsense. Right here, right now, I call the shots."



Alexia's grip only tightened, choking off any chance for Marilee to cry out.


Color drained from Marilee's face as her vision blurred. "Let... go..." The world went white as she struggled for air.


Satisfaction gleamed in Alexia's eyes as she leaned in. "Here's the thing, Marilee... I don't put up with pests. Don't mistake my patience for weakness. Next time you cross the line, you'll wish you hadn't."


Just like that, Alexia let go.


Marilee collapsed, clutching her throat as she coughed and gagged, fear etched in every feature.


Marilee coughed and retched, her eyes filled with fear and hatred.


Alexia gave her a cold glance and walked away.


Left behind, Marilee shivered, a chilling dread creeping over her.


She dragged herself to the restroom, eyes wide as she caught the angry red line across her neck in the mirror-already darkening with bruises.


She stormed out of the restroom, only to be stopped by a male voice.


"Marilee, what are you doing out here?"


Marilee's eyes widened at the sight of Roger-supposedly bedridden in the hospital-standing there in a sharp suit.



Burying the surge of panic, Marilee threw herself into Roger's arms, her tears shimmering. "Roger!"


His arms tightened around her, eyes darting over her features. "Tell me who hurt you. What happened to your neck?"
Tears streaming, Marilee cried out, "I was at the party with a friend when I ran into Alexia. She went after me without mercy. I'm terrified. She's never forgiven me for taking everything away from her."


Sympathy darkened Roger's expression. He reassured her gently, "Alexia's only lashing out because she envies you. I promise, I won't let her treat you this way again. But how did she even get invited here?"


A glimmer of bitterness flickered in Marilee's gaze."She always manages to use men to get what she wants. Every time, she cozies up to the right people and finds a way in."


That answer made Roger's temper flare. He replied with a scoff, "That woman never quits! Let's go settle this once and for all."



Meanwhile, Alexia had slipped out onto the balcony,letting the night air calm her nerves. Before long,a stylish woman approached.


"Excuse me, miss. Is the necklace you're wearing the Stellar designed by Edward Diaz?"


The unexpected question made Alexia's fingers drift to her necklace. She nodded. "Yes, it is."


"How lovely! Please hold still a moment. I just want to see it up close." The woman's admiration was obvious. "That necklace is incredible, and it matches your look perfectly!"


A little flustered, Alexia managed a small smile."Thank you."


Pushing her red glasses up her nose, the woman asked, "Did your boyfriend give you this necklace?"


"No, actually. It was a friend," Alexia said after a brief hesitation. Defining her connection with Waylon wasn't easy, so she settled for his description.


Surprise flickered across the woman's face. "Only a friend? Are you sure? The Stellar wasn't made to be given lightly. It's part of a couple's set-there's a matching men's ring designed for it!"


That revelation caught Alexia off guard. "What do you mean?"


"You must not know the whole story," the woman replied, her disappointment quickly shifting into enthusiasm. "Legend has it the designer found inspiration in a star called CX330-famous for its solitary beauty."


###Chapter 28 Don't Lay A Finger On Her
"Countless stars have companions, but this one drifts through the vast darkness alone. Some might call it lonely, yet the designer sees something different. In his mind, the star never pities itself.True wisdom, he believes, belongs to those unafraid of solitude, those who light their own way, untouched by the darkness around them. The largest sapphire in your necklace carries this very meaning-standing for honor, sincerity, and intellect. In the eyes of the designer, CX330 is just like that gemstone: regal and wise, a beacon that inspires admiration from all wwho glimpse it."


Studying Alexia's face with keen interest, the woman continued, "The matching men's ring is called the Companion. It was made to stand beside and protect the star. Not every star needs a companion,though-CX330 shines just fine alone. Still, the Companion ring symbolizes a love that never fades. That's what the whole set means: loyal, silent devotion. Isn't that just the sweetest thing?"

Alexia, still caught off guard, nodded as she found her voice. "It's beautiful-so romantic."


What a story of romance.


Admiration filled the woman's tone as she added,"When this set was revealed, collectors scrambled for it. The price went through the roof. Yet, the designer claimed it was truly one-of-a-kind-never to be sold. Instead, it spent years on display in a museum for the world to see. But today, seeing it worn by you feels like a stroke of luck!"①


A knowing grin appeared as she continued, "If this necklace was a gift from a man, don't let the chance slip away! You ought to ask him about his feelings.Maybe he's cared about you far longer than you realize."


A jolt ran through Alexia's chest, her pulse thundering in her ears. She shook her head,trying to brush it off. "No way."


Despite her protests, her gaze automatically swept the crowd, searching for any sign of Waylon.


Her eyes found him at last.


Even surrounded by admirers, Waylon's poise was unmistakable-cool, detached, every inch the nobleman.


A quick apology escaped her lips. "Sorry, please excuse me." She turned to head in his direction.


Her steps started slow but quickly picked up speed.


Suddenly, a grating voice cut through the noise."Alexia, don't move another inch!"


The words stopped Alexia in her tracks. She felt a chill settle over her.


As she looked back, Roger's figure came into view.He wore a sleek suit, but there was a pale edge to his features. Marilee clung to him, her face drawn and full of complaint.
A chill crept into Alexia's tone. "So you managed to survive, Roger?"


The sting of her words made Roger's cheeks flush.Coughing with irritation, he dropped his gaze. "Are you that eager to see me gone?"


Every eye in the room seemed drawn to Alexia that evening. Her radiance turned heads, and even Roger,ready to confront her, couldn't help but be caught off guard for a moment.


But suspicion clouded his mind. He wondered how someone without a job could afford such an elegant dress and the expensive jewelry.


Annoyance flickered in his expression as he spat out,"You could get in because you've found yourself a rich man, huh? Are you that vain?"


Without missing a beat, Alexia retorted, "Why is it any of your business? Shouldn't your focus be on wrapping up our divorce and finally making Marilee your wife, instead of keeping her in the shadows? At the rate you drag things out, Gibson Group is doomed under your watch."


Color drained from Marilee's cheeks, while Roger's anger boiled over.



He couldn't deny it-Alexia wasn't the same woman she used to be.



Gone was the quiet, accommodating wife. Now,every word she uttered seemed calculated to cut him to the core.



Moments like this made Roger question everything.


All of this fuss over an affair and a request for divorce? Did she truly despise him this much?


She used to love him deeply. Was it possible for one betrayal to erase everything? Or was she simply acting out, hoping to keep his attention?


His voice chilled as he said, "Our divorce isn't even official, and you're already scrambling for someone else. If you think being some man's plaything makes you special, you're just humiliating yourself."

With a determined look, he reached for Alexia's arm,intent on pulling her aside.


Before he could lay a hand on her, a heavy slap forced him to recoil.


A steely command sounded at her side. "Don't lay a finger on her."


Waylon had stepped up, standing solidly at Alexia's side.
 
###Chapter 29 Settle Things Right Here,Right Now
Roger's eyes narrowed as he took in the sudden confrontation.



Instantly, the chatter around them faded, and every head turned, curiosity and excitement burning in their eyes. A cold shiver crept up Roger's spine as he clenched his fists in silent frustration.



To Alexia's surprise, Waylon's usual composure had vanished, his features shadowed with anger.Furrowed brows and tight lips made it clear-he was truly upset.


She glanced away, keeping her voice casual. "You didn't have to come. Is everything handled?"


Towering over the group, Waylon replied, "It's finished. I just heard some commotion and thought l should see for myself."

Marilee trembled where she stood, biting down on her lip and shrinking from Waylon's frigid stare. One look from him was enough to make anyone shudder.


Roger, too, struggled beneath Waylon's presence.For a moment, he felt like a child again, powerless and exposed.


Bracing himself, Roger forced out a protest. "Alexia,we're not even officially divorced. Isn't it wrong for you to be so close to Mr. Mason?"①


Laughter spilled from Alexia before she could stop herself. The irony wasn't lost on her-Roger had Marilee on his arm, yet he dared to question her choices.



Before she could retort, Waylon's steely glare cut right through Roger. "What's wrong about it?"


A single look from Waylon was enough to make Roger feel as if he'd been cut to the bone, the man's presence as overwhelming as a crashing wave.


Not a word escaped Roger's lips. "I asked you a question." Waylon's tone cast a heavy stillness over the crowd.



Spectators found themselves almost pitying Roger as the tension mounted.


Commanding respect and emotion with nothing but his bearing, Waylon could easily set the tone-whether warm and gracious, or chillingly severe.


One question from him, and Roger's confidence evaporated-leaving only a cold sweat behind.


Allen's advice flashed through Roger's mind, helping him gather his wits. "Sorry, I was being rude. Mr.Mason, I'll take a glass of wine as an apology."Without waiting for a response, he snatched a glass of hard liquor from a passing tray and swallowed it in one go.


His body, still weak from illness, reeled under the harsh burn of alcohol.


Without missing a beat, Waylon gestured for the waiter to refill the glass. "Keep going."


Although no names were uttered, Roger stiffened from head to toe.


Tension gripped the hall, the only sound breaking the silence was the distant, unwavering music, making the air feel even heavier. Marilee clung to Roger, fear written across her features.


Stories about Waylon had swirled for seven years,painting him as a man who controlled the world around him with almost effortless authority.


Despite how far-fetched the stories became,everyone knew his influence was real. He didn't need rumors to prove his power.


Now, in full view of everyone, Waylon made it clear he was singling Roger out. There was nothing subtle or hidden about it.



Left without any hope of matching such force, Roger found himself completely outmatched.


Surrounded by onlookers, Roger swallowed his pride, his hand trembling as he reached for the glass again.


Once Roger tossed back the drink, Waylon's voice remained level. "Have another."


Several rounds later, Roger's legs barely supported him,his vision swimming.


Strangely, not a single soul spoke in his defense or tried to intervene.



From the sidelines, Elton and Korbin exchanged amused looks, clearly entertained.


Elton quipped, "Think we should get you an ambulance? I don't think you can last much longer."


Grinding his teeth, Roger spat out, "That won't be necessary"


Korbin only smirked. "Oh, so you want to keep going?A few more rounds might sharpen your senses, if anything."


Every sip burned Roger's throat and left his insides in turmoil, yet he recognized the ridicule behind their words.


No attempt was made to hide the insult. It was clear they wanted him to see just how powerless he was next to Waylon.



With the next drink poured, Roger paused,uncertainty flickering in his eyes.


Elton arched a brow, taunting him, "What's wrong?Thinking of quitting? You should know, the results are in for Griffinham's final legal gambling license.Only Gibson Group and Braxton Group made the cut."


Roger snapped back to attention. "Braxton Group?"


Right on cue, Matteo Braxton stepped forward from the crowd.



"It's been a while, Roger." Matteo, whose intense stare and sharp brow gave him a formidable presence, matched Roger's age but outmatched him in confidence.



At the sight of his old enemy, Roger felt his resolve slipping. Everyone knew the bitter history between the Gibson family and the Braxton family. Once, the latter had been brought low by Roger's family. Now, here Matteo was, fighting toe-to-toe for their state's last gambling license.


The situation felt almost absurd.


Tension hardened Roger's expression. "There's no way this is happening. How did Braxton Group even manage to get into the Chamber of Commerce? The Gibson family's casino has always outperformed the Braxton family's in every way."


"Decisions like that aren't for you to make," Elton replied smoothly, casting a glance at Waylon. "How about we settle things right here, right now?"


Turning away from the crowd, Waylon fixed his gaze on Alexia. "How would you like to decide?"
 
###Chapter 30 The Results Were Decided

One question from Waylon and the entire hall turned their attention back to Alexia.


An unexpected spotlight held her motionless.Waylon's gesture had caught her completely off guard.


Still, she managed to reply, "Alright."①


With a flash of excitement, Elton chimed in, "Let's make it interesting-a drinking contest. The winner takes the license."



Matteo nodded, his tone smooth. "Thank you for giving me this opportunity. I'm in."


Korbin glanced at Roger. "What about you? Are you in?"



That invitation sent a ripple of anxiety through the crowd.



Everyone knew Roger stood little chance; this was a challenge meant to break him. From every angle, the rules tilted against him, setting the stage for a public defeat.



Even Marilee's confidence wavered. "Roger, please.Don't do this."



Anyone could see he was being singled out and set up.


A cold sweat broke across Roger's brow as he weighed his choices.


If he stepped up, his body might fail him before the end,guaranteeing a loss.


Refusing to compete would be a public admission of weakness, and with the gambling license at stake,the future of Gibson Group hung in the balance. The shrinking real estate market left them desperate for new capital.


Disgust flickered across Waylon's face as he watched Roger falter. "If it's too much for you, step aside."


Determination hardened Roger's face. "I'm in, too!"


Elton clapped his hands, approval in his voice."That's more like it."


Moments later, a cart piled with vodka arrived,carrying twenty glasses.


Elton explained, "Each man gets ten shots. Whoever finishes first takes the prize. But don't risk your life over this.Health comes first."



Anxious murmurs rippled through the crowd as they pictured the consequences.


Preparing himself, Matteo twisted open a bottle of milk, settling his nerves and shooting a cold glare at Roger's pale, tense face. Hatred simmered in his chest.



Would Roger finally break under the pressure?


Old wounds between the Braxton and Gibson families still lingered, the sting of betrayal never quite fading from memory.


No contest, no matter how public, could compare to the humiliation Matteo's parents suffered-begging the Gibson family for mercy and finding none.


Tension simmered throughout the hall, every eye drawn to the impending showdown.


Glasses clinked and the contest was on-both men gulping down shot after shot with reckless abandon.①


Every swallow scorched Roger's throat, the burning liquid leaving his body howling in protest, but there was no room for weakness.



Losing was not an option, not while Waylon watched.


Every move Waylon made tonight made it clear-this was all for Alexia, and Roger's pride refused to yield.


He'd long sensed Waylon's interest in Alexia ran deeper than friendship. That certainty had nagged him since their teenage years. Still, what difference did it make? For the past two years, Alexia had been his wife, firmly in his grasp.


No amount of rivalry changed the fact-he was her husband, at least for now. Their divorce wasn't final,not yet.


Pure stubbornness kept Roger going, even as the hall spun and his vision blurred. Somewhere in that haze,he caught a glimpse of Alexia.


Bathed in golden light, she looked almost untouchable.





A gentle smile played on Waylon's lips as he turned to Alexia. "What does Roger mean to you now?"


Nothing in his face betrayed a hint of sarcasm; the question was sincere.


Conversation died around them, all attention fixed on Alexia's reply. Her words were steady. "He means nothing to me."


A sharp, audible crack broke the silence. That single word shattered the last of Roger's resolve. Rigid and pale, he watched helplessly as the glass slipped from his grasp and exploded on the floor. Marilee darted to his side, catching him as he faltered. "Roger!"


All eyes snapped toward the sudden scene.


Waves of pain racked Roger's body, leaving him gasping and clutching his stomach.


Watching him unravel, Marilee's heart twisted with resentment and helplessness. Her eyes shot toward Alexia-just in time to see Waylon offer Alexia his hand."Come with me."



Alexia's fingers slipped easily into Waylon's,choosing him without a second thought.


As they turned away together, the chaos slipped into the background, no longer important.


The results were decided.


All eyes followed Roger-crushed, humiliated, and left standing alone-while sympathy mingled with quiet scorn among the guests.


Guiding Alexia to the center of the hall, Waylon led her out onto the dance floor, ready to open the night with the first waltz.



Music floated through the air. Alexia rested her hand on Waylon's shoulder, while he gently took her other hand.


Her voice, soft but full of meaning, reached his ear."About earlier...thank you."


"Don't mention it. I've had enough of him for years."Waylon changed the subject with a teasing smile."I see you're a natural on the dance floor. Secret lessons?"



Together they glided to the rhythm, sometimes drawn close, sometimes spinning apart. Alexia lifted her chin, pride shining in her eyes. "Naturally. My teacher was top-notch."



"Let me guess-a man?"


"A woman, actually." Alexia's smile softened with memory. "We met in high school, back in Bymill. She showed me nothing but kindness. Sadly, she passed away three years ago." That last word dimmed her brightness.


Regret flickered across Waylon's features. "I didn't mean to remind you of something sad. I'm sorry."


A look of surprise crossed Alexia's face. "You don't have to apologize for that. Waylon, you never apologized before."


"That was a different time," he answered quiely."People aren't meant to stay the same forever."


A quiet pause fell between them. After a moment,Alexia asked, "Have you been alright these past seven years?"
###Chapter 31 That's Slander

It was the first time Alexia had ever asked about Waylon's past.


With a composed expression and that calm air he always carried, Waylon simply replied, "If we're talking about the results, yes-l've been alright."①


It felt like they silently agreed not to bring up those missing seven years.


"I didn't just learn the waltz for fun," Alexia said with a casual shrug. "I'm guessing you've forgotten the bet,though."


Back then, she had followed Waylon relentlessly from one competition to another. Always trying to catch up. Sometimes winning, often losing, but never backing down.


The waltz? That had been a penalty. A playful one,maybe, but it mattered. She'd lost a bet back then,

and the price was simple-she had to be his partner for his formal dance event.



But that dance never happened.


That year, a lot happened within the Mason family,and because of their reckless youth, they ended up going their separate ways.


Just when Alexia thought he wouldn't say a word,Waylon unexpectedly pulled her into his arms. She felt weightless, like a feather caught on the wind.


His arm wrapped around her waist as he lowered his gaze to meet hers."I remember."



The way he looked at her-focused, unwavering-made her heart skip a beat. His chiseled features were striking, but it was that quiet intensity in his gaze that stole her breath.


By the time the dance came to a close,the hall was filled with applause.


Just then, a deep voice rang out from behind them.
"Mr. Mason, it's been a long time!"


They turned to see a middle-aged man dressed in a pristine white suit. He had clearly been watching from a distance and only approached now that the music had stopped.


Waylon's expression cooled ever so slightly as he recognized the man. "Mr. Walsh. It has been a while."


"Yes, yes. The last time was... five years ago? In Aelholt, wasn't it? I must say, you've only become more impressive with time." Johann Walsh chuckled as he stepped forward, rubbing his hands together in an almost nervous gesture. His eyes shifted toward Alexia, and that initial politeness gave way to open admiration. "This young lady beside you is breathtaking. My own date tonight doesn't come close."



Waylon's gaze darkened the moment he caught Johann eyeing Alexia a bit too boldly. His voice turned frosty. "Do you have a reason for staring?"


Johann chuckled, caught off guard."Ahno offense meant. Just a bit of harmless admiration. Honestly,talking business with you is always difficult, Mr.Mason. Maybe I should've tried my luck with the lady first-might've had better odds."


Alexia smiled coolly. "Then you'd be making a mistake. Business and friendship don't mix when it comes to Waylon. If you want to work with him,sincerity's the only way in."


Johann's smile faltered. He looked at her more closely now, realizing this wasn't someone to be underestimated.



Waylon noticed the change in Johann's demeanor and raised a brow. "So then, what exactly brings you here tonight?"


Johann straightened his tie, trying to regain composure. "On behalf of Blackcurrant Group, I'm here to explore potential collaborations. From what I've seen, your company's shifted its focus to bioengineering in recent years, with quite a few major initiatives underway. We're extremely interested.After all, the future lies in biotech, and our firm is globally recognized for that. Especially our latest initiative, the Daylight Project-it's all about advancing human welfare. There's plenty of synergy between us,I believe."


As soon as he finished, Alexia let out a light laugh,clearly amused.


Johann's confidence wavered under her stare.Frowning, he asked, "May I ask what you find so funny?"


Alexia didn't soften the blow. "Over the past few years, Goldedge has seen multiple outbreaks-new viruses showing up one after another. Preliminary findings pointed to human-made biochemical tampering. And though the reports were conveniently buried, guess whose name kept popping up?Blackcurrant Group. So tell me, have you really turned things around in just two years?"


Johann's heart thudded uneasily. The hit had landed.


His tone sharpened as he leaned in. "That's slander.
Whether there's evidence or not, technology is neutral-it's how it's used that matters. If you let unproven gossip cloud your judgment, you'll only slow your own advancement."


Alexia's eyes gleamed with cool defiance. "Don't get it twisted. I'm not against biotech, and I'm not throwing baseless shade at your company. I'm pointing at you. As someone in charge, you either overlooked or enabled everything that happened in Goldedge. That's not unfortunate-that's incompetence. If you can't even control your own team, what makes you think we'd trust you here?A company buried in scandals pretending to serve humanity? Please. Save the PR for someone gullible."


Johann's face changed the second her words hit home. He clearly hadn't expected Alexia to be so blunt, but since she was, there was no point in pretending. "This world runs on power. There are leaders, and there are followers. Technology is just another weapon to keep the upper hand. I'm sure Mr.Mason knows that better than anyone."
###Chapter 32 Smart Choice, Mr.Mason
Johann's eyes lit up with fervor. "Mr. Mason, our project offers boundless potential. You'd be wise to give it real consideration."


Waylon answered coolly, "That won't be necessary.Alexia's decision is mine."


Johann's face turned red with anger. He couldn't believe Waylon was actually listening to her.


"What does she even know? You're passing up a major opportunity because of her? Have you lost your mind?"


Alexia's eyes narrowed dangerously, but before she could speak, Waylon gently rested a hand on her shoulder. "This is exactly why I don't waste time with you, Johann. You always bring nonsense with you.Alexia not just my companion and friend-she's someone I respect as a worthy rival. So tell me, what right do you have to bad-mouth her?"

Johann stiffened, staring at Alexia in utter disbelief.


A worthy rival? Had he really heard that right?


Could this woman truly be someone Waylon would place on equal footing? Was she really that capable?


Johann's face twisted in annoyance, and he sneered."Mr. Mason, we have the finest minds and the most advanced scientific equipment. What could she possibly bring to the table?"



Alexia gave a sly smile. "Advanced equipment? Oh,you mean the RA-1001? So, did you finally manage to find someone who knows how to use it?"



Johann went ghostly pale, staring at Alexia like she'd just revealed a dark secret.



How on earth did she know about one of their most guarded secrets?


Three years earlier, someone delivered cutting-edge equipment to Blackcurrant Group, but it was too advanced for anyone to figure out.
The machine was crucial to the Daylight Project.They came to Afoross hoping to find someone to unlock it. Whispers claimed its creator was an elusive genius from here.


Looking at Alexia now, Johann started to question if he'd just offended someone way out of his league.


Waylon gave a slight gesture to his bodyguard."Escort him out."



The bodyguard stepped up and held out a hand."This way, Mr. Walsh."


If he didn't move on his own, they'd have no problem tossing him out.


Johann was stunned by the disrespect. "Mr. Mason,your reputation for arrogance isn't exaggerated-you're as reckless as they say."


Today's rejection was a bitter pill he couldn't force down. Someday, they would regret treating him like this.


With that bitter thought, Johann turned and walked out, refusing to look back as countless eyes followed his exit.



Alexia turned to Waylon. "You turned him down because you trust me, right?"


"I trust both you and myself," he replied calmly.


Alexia grinned and gave him a thumbs-up. "Smart choice!"



Waylon stared at her and asked, "Care to explain how you know about RA-1001?"


"My professor once mentioned it during a project.Blackcurrant Group has a messy past. Years ago,they invited him to a seminar, and he nearly didn't make it back," Alexia said with a sigh. "He hasn't stepped out of the country since."


Waylon narrowed his eyes. "Anything else? Any other source of intel?"



"No way!" Alexia blinked innocently. "I've just been an ordinary housewife for the last couple of years."
Waylon shot her a cold, cutting look. "Maybe if you'd used your brain, you wouldn't have been so easy to manipulate."


"Please don't bring up those painful memories again,Mr.Mason."


"Mr. Mason, huh? I remember you called me Wally not long ago."


That comment caught her off guard, and for a brief second, her composure slipped.


Once the auction began, both of them took their seats in the center of the VIP section.



Not far behind, Marilee and Roger entered and found seats a few rows back. After Roger lost the drinking challenge, Marilee had tried to persuade him to go to the hospital, but he stubbornly refused.


To Roger, this wasn't just about losing a game-it was about losing face, and worse, losing the gambling license the Gibson family had always assumed was theirs. If he walked out now, the whole of Afoross Would say Waylon had sent him packing.


He couldn't stomach that kind of disgrace. Not now.Not ever.


Pale-faced and brooding, Roger stared holes into the pair seated ahead of him.


The auctioneer was already introducing the first item,but Roger barely heard a word. All he could see was Alexia, seated beside Waylon like nothing had ever happened. The sight made his blood boil."Unbelievable," he muttered bitterly. "She used to swear she hated him, and now she's all over him.Liar."



Marilee let out a soft, smug laugh and gently patted his arm. "Don't waste your anger on someone like her. She's born to climb ladders. Nothing she says ever means anything."

###Chapter 33 Adam's Heart

Taking a slow breath, Roger steadied his nerves. With tenderness, he reached for Marilee's hand, his tone gentle. "My mother has already told me everything.Marilee, you looked after me so well at the hospital,and I can tell your kindness is real. Tonight, if anything catches your fancy, just let me know. I'll make sure you have it."①


A blush crept onto Marilee's cheeks as her eyes wandered to the nearby display. Something dazzling drew her in. "Roger, over there-see that crown? Isn't it breathtaking?"


The brilliance of the crown captured not only Marilee's attention but aIso everyone else's. Its grand unveiling sent a buzz through the hall, and even the auctioneer's voice vibrated with excitement. "Now,feast your eyes on this exquisite creation-the Adam's Heart! The centerpiece is none other than the rarest, largest ruby in the world, a symbol of Adam's heart. This crown stands for Adam's everlasting, unbreakable love for Eve. Bidding will open at one hundred million."


A hush swept over the audience at such a staggering opening price.


Without hesitation, Roger lifted his paddle high. "One hundred fifty million."


Heads swiveled at his bold move, and murmurs erupted throughout the hall.


"Did you see that? Roger's making a statement tonight. Who's the lucky recipient?"


"It's obvious, isn't it? He's with Marilee, the newly acknowledged Jenkins daughter."


"She's a celebrity, after all. It's no wonder she's turned Roger's head."


Bathed in admiration, Marilee drew herself up, pride shining in her eyes.


Roger's offer set off a sudden surge of interest from the crowd.


A clear voice rang out. "Two hundred million."


Another chimed in, "Two hundred and fifty million."


Someone else didn't hesitate. "Three hundred and fifty million!"


Both Roger and Marilee were left wide-eyed at how fast things escalated. Roger, in particular, began to feel something wasn't quite right as more bidders joined in.


The new players were mostly from rising tech and finance circles, a starkcontrast to the old-money families like the Gibsons. When a pharmaceutical giant pushed the bid to four hundred million,the hall buzzed with speculation.


A handful of executives in tailored suits watched the crown as if nothing else existed. Tension, heavy and silent,passed between rivals.


A whisper escaped Marilee, her voice edged with disbelief. "Roger..." The bidding had soared to four
hundred million. Even with the Gibson family's wealth, that sum seemed reckless.


Deep down, she knew Roger wouldn't risk everything just to win her favor.


A shadow crossed Roger's face as he weighed his next move. When he looked up, his eyes landed on Alexia murmuring something to Waylon. The two of them fit together effortlessly, their heads nearly touching as they shared quiet words.


The sight hit Roger in a place he rarely acknowledged, and his fingers curled into a tight fist.


So that was Alexia's game-chasing a higher rung on the social ladder.①



Did she really believe this display would spark regret in him?


How absurd it all seemed. In Roger's eyes, Alexia meant nothing.


He made up his mind-everything he had to give would now go to someone else, if only to make a point.


With ironclad determination, Roger lifted his paddle,his voice clear and unwavering. "Five hundred million!"



That sum was fifty times more than the amount he had planned to set aside for Alexia's divorce. He wanted her to see that her years with him meant as little as a speck of stone in the crown's setting.


Never once did he consider her worthy of standing beside Marilee.


All around, the crowd erupted in gasps and hushed chatter, every gaze flicking to Marilee with curiosity and awe.



"Can you believe it? Roger's willing to drop five hundred million for Marilee? He sure never spent like that on his ex-wife."



"It's no wonder Alexia's so out of place now. The moment their divorce was announced, Roger was already parading Marilee around at business events,
treating her like royalty. Makes you wonder if Alexia ever felt loved at all."


"Honestly, what did she expect? Even the Jenkins family barely looked her way after the real daughter turned up. Two decades under their roof, and she was tossed aside without a thought. A house pet would have earned more loyalty. If Waylon hadn't shown up, who knows what would've become of her?"



"They're just friends, right? Waylon and Alexia go way back, childhood stuff. He's only helping her because he feels sorry for her."


A small, satisfied grin crept onto Marilee's lips as she overheard the whispers swirling around her.


Roger's bold jump in the bidding knocked the wind out of the other tycoons.


Few expected him to wade into such a cutthroat contest. To them, his actions bordered on lunacy.


Yet the hall's expectations were upended again when Waylon lifted his own paddle.


His words rang out steady and unbothered. "One billion. Spare me the incremental games."


The announcement sent a jolt through the crowd.


More than one bidder struggled to breathe, caught off guard by the staggering leap. For a heartbeat,the bustling hall went dead quiet-only to explode into frenzied commotion seconds later.


"Did you catch that? One billion? That's insane!"


"Waylon's pulling a wild card. But why is he after the crown? He's never shown interest in jewelry before!"


"Nobody's got the nerve to match that! He's changed the whole game!"


"Roger's out of his league now. Wait... Is Waylon doing this for Alexia's sake?"
###Chapter 34 Are We Watching A Royal Ceremony Or What
Whispers exploded across the room like sparks on dry grass, and every eye zeroed in on Roger, hungry to see how he'd respond.


In that instant, Roger felt the weight of the room pressing down on him.


Everyone was staring, silently questioning-would he dare to raise his paddle? And even if he did, could he actually afford it?


Marilee hadn't seen it coming-Waylon placing a bid,and such a huge one at that. Worried, she lightly tugged Roger's sleeve. "Roger, do you think Waylon's targeting you? Maybe Alexia's behind it,trying to humiliate you?"


Everyone knew the truth-if it came down to wealth,Roger couldn't outbid Waylon, not in a million years.

Roger shot daggers at Alexia's back, his jaw clenched tight. "Pathetic," he growled.


Whether Alexia was behind it or not, the moment Waylon stepped in, she had already won something-attention, favor, maybe more.


As soon as the auctioneer caught Waylon's bid, his voice softened with deference. He politely scanned the hall for any further bids.


But everyone knew the truth-once Waylon made a move, the game was already over.


This wasn't just a flex of wealth-it was a power move. Every person in the hall was here hoping to get on Waylon's good side.


He wasn't just rich; he was history's youngest president of the Chamber of Commerce, and his approval carried more weight than the ten billion price tag.


Even the powerful business tycoons who had placed earlier bids could only watch with regret. As for Roger, no matter how furious he was, he could only sit there and stew in silence.


With a firm strike of the gavel, the auctioneer declared the crown officially Waylon's.


Just then, someone leaned in and whispered something to the auctioneer. Moments later, an attendant was told to bring the crown straight to Alexia.



Alexia blinked in confusion and glanced at Waylon.He let out a soft chuckle and said gently, "Don't move."



Then, in front of everyone, he gently placed the crown on her head.



For a moment, the whole room held its breath, and then, a wave of gasps rippled through the crowd.Roger sat stiff, like he'd just taken a slap he hadn't seen coming.


"Perfect," Waylon murmured, clearly pleased.


That single word sent another ripple through the already shocked crowd.


"Oh my God, did he seriously buy it for Alexia?"


"And he didn't just buy it-he put it on her himself!Are we watching a royal ceremony or what?"


"I'm losing it. I actually can't breathe. This is unreal.I'd trade places with her in a heartbeat!"


"Alexia's so lucky! I'm starting to believe she dumped Roger, not the other way around. Honestly? Good for her.She chose right!"


As the comments swirled through the air, Marilee sat frozen, her gaze locked on the radiant woman with the crown. Jealousy didn't even begin to cover what she felt-there was a deep, bitter ache twisting inside her, one that left her breathless and furious.


Why did Alexia always end up taking what should've been hers? And not just quietly-no, Alexia had to take it proudly, with her chin up, with everyone watching.


Marilee's nails dug into her palm. She despised Alexia deeply.


Meanwhile, Alexia, still reeling, turned to the man beside her with a mix of surprise and amusement."Why did you just put it on me like that?"


Waylon remained composed, his tone as smooth as his movements. "Because I bought it for you. A crown isn't meant to sit in a box-it belongs on your head. Unless...you don't like it?"


"I love it," Alexia replied, lifting her chin with pride."In fact,I love it a lot!"



Waylon's lips twitched, almost forming a smile.


Back on stage, the auctioneer raised his voice once more. "Next up, donated by AMOS Gallery, we present a controversial masterpiece by the prodigious artist Sirius-titled Revenge,"The moment the artist's name was announced,murmurs broke out across the hall like wildfire.


And it wasn't hard to see why. The enigmatic artist had shot to fame early on, shaking up the art world with her bold, unapologetic style. People either worshipped her brilliance or loathed her work entirely -there was rarely an in-between.


Her work wasn't just art-it sparked debates, think pieces, and sometimes outrage. Her latest work,Revenge, was no exception.


In the painting, Pandora-used by the gods for revenge and blamed by humans for bringing disaster -stood over her husband's dead body. She leaned sweetly into Zeus' arms, the king of the gods, while secretly hiding a dagger behind his neck.


Sirius' style mixed expressionism with Dadaism. Her skillful use of composition and color brought out deep emotions, and she had a talent for telling layered stories through her art.


When Revenge was first shown, it caused an immediate uproar. Traditionalists were quick to criticize her, saying she twisted the myths with dark and intense ideas. To them, Pandora was nothing more than a beautiful figure created by the gods to tempt men-a shallow character, clueless but  dangerously curious, who only brought trouble to the world.


She was meant to be the first woman sent to humanity, yet in the painting, she dared to kill Zeus.


That was unthinkable to them. Who would even imagine such a thing, let alone paint it? Surely, they thought, no decent person could've created something like that.
###Chapter 35 Roger's Salvation
The newer generation of artists had a different take-they saw Sirius' art as bold and defiant, a rebellious voice in a conformist world. Many admired her deeply, almost to the point of obsession.


Alexia sat in silence, her gaze fixed on the canvas being displayed-her own creation.


Revenge had been born from the darkest ###Chapter of her life. Though always proud, she'd found herself suffocating in the mess of a crumbling marriage and family duties. Each day chipped away at her until she barely recognized herself anymore.


The painting wasn't just art-it was a scream, a raw eruption of every injustice she'd swallowed. A need to rip apart everything that had broken her.


Marilee sat among the murmurs, rolling her eyes internally at the praise. She never liked these so-called prodigies. "What's so amazing about Sirius way? Looks like she's just doing it for attention.Don't youI think so, Roger?"


She turned to him with a light smile, expecting agreement, but froze. His entire expression had shifted. The gloom was gone. He was now staring at the painting on stage with a sharp focus and a spark in his eyes she had never seen before.



"It's her..." Roger whispered in a low voice.


Marilee's smile faltered. A faint unease crept in."Roger, do you know her?"


He gave a slow nod, then shook his head,almost mocking himself. "I did once. I had the chance, but l ruined it."



Back when he was taken in by the Gibson family,Roger had carried the weight of his humble past like a curse. Surrounded by judgment, he assumed the world saw him as less, and so, he returned the sentiment.



Allen never eased up on him. The rules were rigid, the pressure suffocating. Roger had turned to boxing as an escape, something he could control. After putting in a lot of effort, he finally got into competitions, but he kept losing. There was even a time he got beaten so badly his face was left bruised and swollen. It was only when he was completely pushed to his limits that he managed to win a match or two.


He remembered those days all too well-walking into school bruised and disheveled, only to see Waylon's name gleaming on every honor board. He was always surrounded and admired by students and staff alike.Compared to Waylon, everyone else seemed to vanish into the background.①


It had felt brutally unfair. Some people didn't need to try-they just were, and the world couldn't help but be drawn to them.


Allen, bitter over Waylon's success, pushed Roger endlessly. If he wasn't berating, he was mocking.


"Boxing? What a joke! You should be hitting the books instead! Waylon's score is miles ahead of yours. I brought in top-tier tutors for you, and this is how you thank me?"


The butler tried to calm Allen. "Please calm down,Mr. Gibson. Roger is already quite intelligent, but Waylon has always been something else. A born genius..."


"So others can be geniuses, but not Roger? Look at him! Can't even win a fight. What use is that?"


Surrounded by sneers and criticism, Roger had no choice but to silently close the door and throw himself back into training.


He first crossed paths with Sirius during an early elimination match. That day, everything felt off-his body was sluggish, his mind filled with doubt. Every hit he took seemed to echo with Allen's biting ridicule.



By halftime, he was exhausted-physically and mentally. He shuffled toward his coach, tempted to call it quits, when a girl suddenly appeared and handed him a sketchbook.
"Hey, you're Roger, right? Someone wanted you to have this," she said casually.


He took it without much thought, but the moment he flipped it open, his breath caught.


Page after page held rough yet vivid drawings of him.His form captured in various matches-win or lose,battered or proud-each sketch held something more than lines.



No matter the outcome-victorious or defeated,bloodied or determined-she had drawn him like a hero, as though he were the centerpiece of his own story.


At the very end, a single name was scribbledd: Sirius.


Back then, the name meant nothing to him. The girl explained, "Sirius had to leave early and couldn't stay to watch the rest of your match. But she asked me to pass this on to you-life is like a game. There are no forever winners or losers. If y/ou give your all every time, you've already won. Keep giving it your best in the matches ahead!"
Looking back, it wasn't dramatic to say-she was his salvation.


It felt like being pulled from the depths just as he was about to drown-her words, that sketchbook, gave him the air he desperately needed.


He stepped back into the ring as if something had changed. It was like victory herself had taken his side. That round, he fought like a man reborn and won.



It wasn't long before he discovered the truth that Sirius was no ordinary girl. She was a rising star in the art world, already famous by the time they met.The first time he ever walked into an art gallery was for her.



When he walked into the gallery, his footsteps stopped in front of a massive painting.Around him,people whispered in awe about how much it had sold for-an outrageous sum.①


But none of that mattered. The moment he looked at the canvas, every other sound disappeared.

He had never met Sirius before, and he didn't know the first thing about art, but standing there, he felt it deep in his gut-Sirius was born for this. She belonged to the world of art, a world full of brilliance and creativity.


She was part of that rare group of geniuses, and someone like him could never truly reach her.

###Chapter 36 Fight To The End

During the finals, Roger crossed paths with the young woman again, and that time, he returned the sketchbook.



She glanced at him curiously. "Why are you giving it back? Didn't you like it?"


He looked away, eyes growing colder. "Not even a little.Tell her to stop drawing me. I never want her attention again."


The memory surfaced as Roger stared at the painting now displayed on stage. "Sirius is remarkable. No matter what people say, whether they mock or envy her,she's unmatched."


Marilee felt a quiet jab in her chest. She spoke lightly,but her jealousy slipped through. "Roger, do you like her?"



How could he speak with such admiration for someone he didn't even know personally?


Roger averted his eyes. "I just admire her, that's all."


As he finished, the auctioneer's voice echoed through the hall. "Starting bid for this painting-twenty million!"


Murmurs rippled through the hall as the crowd exchanged looks, clearly impressed by the skyrocketing value of Sirius' work.


The fact that a modern painting could fetch such a staggering price spoke volumes about its global influence.



Roger didn't pause for even a second. He raised his paddle confidently."Forty million."


Marilee froze on the spot. When she saw the unshakable resolve in Roger's eyes, frustration welled up inside her, and she bit her lip hard.


Alexia,too, was caught off guard. She couldn't quite make sense of Roger's sudden urge to get involved.Noticing that most of the crowd had gone quiet, and few dared to challenge Roger's bid, she lifted her paddle. "Sixty million."


Her sudden bid made Waylon turn to look at her,while murmurs and gasps rippled through the crowd.


"Wait, Alexia's bidding too? And against Roger?Wasn't he her ex-husband?"



"She must be doing it out of spite. Everyone knows Roger is bidding for Marilee. My husband said their affair has been an open secret for two years-Roger never even tried to hide it. Alexia was the only one who didn't know. It's no surprise she wants payback."



"What affair? Marilee's the rightful heiress of the Jenkins family. If there hadn't been that mix-up years ago, she'd be the one married to Roger, not Alexia.Honestly, Alexia was never meant to win. She's just some penniless stand-in."



"If Roger had loved Marilee so much, he wouldn't have married another woman to begin with!"
The murmurs around the hall reached Roger, and his face clouded over with growing irritation.


Meanwhile, Marilee's eyes welled up, portraying the image of a heartbroken victim all too convincingly.


Roger held her hand tightly and promised in a low,resolute voice, "Marilee, don't worry. I'll marry you and give you a wedding so grand the world won't dare question you again."


Marilee gave a small nod but still looked concerned."I believe you, Roger, but do you really think Alexia is doing this just to spite us?"


Roger sneered, shooting Alexia a contemptuous glance. "She really thinks she can challenge me just because she's hanging onto Waylon now?" His face steeled, and without hesitation, he raised his paddle again. "One hundred million!"



He refused to let Alexia walk away with a victory, no matter what it took.


A frosty smile tugged at Alexia's lips. She had no intention of letting Roger take that painting home.


"One hundred twenty million," she said calmly.


Roger's gaze sharpened. It was clear-Alexia wasn't backing down. She was in this fight to the end.


An invisible tension filled the air.



Watching from nearby, Waylon's eyes glinted with amusement. "Didn't expect you to be this generous.Looks like you've taken a liking to Sirius after all."


Alexia stiffened, momentarily speechless. "Yes, I like it," she said after a while. "That's why I'm going to win it."



Waylon raised an eyebrow with a faint smirk. "Is that so? Funny-because | like it too."


Alexia was briefly taken aback by his response.


Before she could say anything, Waylon raised his paddle. "Five hundred million," he said, as if it were nothing.


The crowd, already tense, was now completely stunned.


"What is going on? Why is Waylon suddenly bidding?"


"This is turning into some bizarre love triangle. I need a second look just to follow it all."



"ls that painting even worth this much? This is insane!"



Waylon's outrageous bid sent shockwaves through the entire hall.


Roger's confidence faltered for a split second after hearing that number.


Sensing the tension, Marilee gently took his hand and said, "Roger, maybe we should just step back. If Waylon wants it, let him have it. It's only a painting-no need to throw away money over this."


Roger didn't say a word.


For a moment, it seemed like he might back down,just like he had during the fight for the Adam's Heart.
But then, slowly and firmly, he slipped his hand out of Marilee's grasp.


As he did, Marilee felt her heart snk.
###Chapter 37 She's Nothing But Trouble
In a surprising move, Roger shot his paddle into the air. "Six hundred million!"



Shock rippled through the audience, jaws dropping all around.


Excitement that had just filled the hall instantly evaporated, replaced by a hush so heavy it felt unnatural.


Speculation darted from face to face-nobody could figure out what possessed Roger to act like this.



Why compete with Waylon now, after giving up the Adam's Heart? Was it truly about Marilee, or something more?



A wave of attention pressed in on Marilee, and heat crept up her cheeks.
No one else realized that Roger's battle with Waylon wasn't about her at all. At its core, this was for the artist, Sirius.


Roger paid no mind to the whispers or gaping stares.


This entire evening had left him simmering. Losing ground to Waylon-whether in business or over the coveted crown-gnawed at him.


But when it came to Sirius, his resolve was unshakeable.


One look from Roger told Waylon everything he needed to know. Recognizing that possessive glare,Waylon let a wry smile touch his lips and murmured something to the attendant. Moments later, the attendant stepped confidently onto the auction platform.



A bright smile spread across the attendant's face as she addressed the crowd. "For the painting of Sirius,Mr. Mason guarantees to top any offer by an additional three hundred million. Please, the bidding continues."
Waylon's unwavering intent became unmistakable with that single statement.


A wave of murmurs swept through the room,leaving all eyes and pressure trained on Roger.


Every bidder in attendance had already passed strict financial screening before being allowed in. Whether playing with their fortunes or chasing after a dream,there were hard limits here. Anyone who bid beyond their verified means would be disqualified.


Waylon had the luxury of limitless play, but Roger risked exposing his own vulnerability by pushing any further.



The Gibson fortune simply didn't mneasure up to the Mason family's might.


With furrowed brows, Alexia regarded Waylon,graveness settling in her features. "Are you actually serious about this?"



A quick nod from Waylon followed. "When it comes to money, I never joke."
Alexia, unconvinced, asked, "So, Sirius matters to you that much? Or is this just about proving a point?"


Waylon replied, "Why does it matter? I get what l want."



Nothing about his self-assurance surprised Alexia anymore. Her eyes drifted to Roger, reading the tension in his posture without letting her feelings show.



Not so long ago, she would have bent over backward just to see Roger's wishes granted.


Now, the person she used to be felt distant, almost unrecognizable.


Marilee's voice trembled with concern. "Roger..." For the first time, she questioned whether she truly understood him. She always believed she could influence him, but the night's auction revealed a reckless, unfamiliar side.


He was ready to sacrifice everything for a woman he'd never even met. The Adam's Heart-a prize Marilee herself had coveted-meant little to him compared to this.


A hint of worry clouded Marilee's eyes, though she managed to keep her voice gentle. "Let's not push this any further. If your grandfather hears about tonight, you know he'll explode. Waylon has made it clear-he's determined to own that painting.Challenging him here... what would that mean for the Gibson family's future?"


She found it hard to believe Roger could be this blind to their predicament, unless his obsession with Sirius had truly consumed him.


Her caution hit Roger with the weight of truth. He cast a sidelong glance at Waylon and responded with a bitter, hollow laugh.


Only men knew what it took to break another man's spirit. Waylon wielded his wealth and status like a weapon,smothering his pride for all to see.


Anything he set his sights on, Waylon snatched away with ease.
Silence settled across the hall as the auctioneer began the final countdown. When Roger didn't so much as flinch, the crowd shot each other looks of understanding.


No matter how stubborn he was, even Roger had his limits.


The sound of the gavel broke the tension, and with that, the painting belonged to Waylon-at the price of nine hundred million.



No one gasped, no one cried out, but a quiet ripple of conversation circled the room, eyes drifting back to Roger.


"Did he really just walk away from it all?"


"What choice did he really have? Refusing to back down would've forced Allen to apologize in person tomorrow. The poor old man shouldn't have to deal with messes like this at his age."


"Why did Roger even think he could challenge Waylon? Now he's trapped, and everyone's watching -what a mess for him."


"It's always about chasing after a woman, isn't it? In the end, Waylon's just better at this game. Men trying to outdo one another only end up looking ridiculous."


Every word, tinged with derision, pressed heavily on Roger's mood. His expression grew darker by the second, a deep resentment for Alexia flooding in,washing away any last trace of regret he'd felt for her.


In his mind, if she hadn't butted heads with him,Waylon would've stayed out of it, and he wouldn't be the joke of the night.


Eyes fixed on Alexia's retreating figure, bitterness twisted his features. "She's nothing but trouble."

###Chapter 38 Pissed Off

With the auction drawving to a close, Waylon found himself caught up in polite conversation with several distinguished gentlemen, while Alexia, guided by her assistant, made her way out to the entrance to wait.


She lingered alone by the fountain, the night air nipping at her skin. Marilee, spotting her, couldn't resist a jab. "So, the woman everyone stared at tonight ends up left out in the cold. Roger, why don't you offer her a ride?"


A cold look passed over Roger's face as he shot Alexia a glare. "Does she even need help from us?Alexia, you've really mastered social climbing. We just mentioned divorce, and you latched right onto Waylon. Now you've got Andre in tow too. Bet you're feeling proud of yourself."


His words dripped with contempt, meant to wound,yet Alexia only blinked, her tone calm and undisturbed. "That's right. So what are you going to do about it?"


The answer caught Roger off guard, his mouth momentarily hanging open.


Even Marilee was taken aback by her audacity, not expecting her to disregard her own reputation so completely.


With a nonchalant flick of her hair, Alexia continued,"Whether it's Andre or Waylon, either is an upgrade over someone like you. Everyone wants something better, don't they? Why shouldn'tl?"


"A man like me? Even at my worst, I'm still above a woman who would sell herself for a leg up."


A scornful laugh escaped Alexia. "You're in no place to lecture me. Tell me, where was your so-called morality when you and Marilee sneaked around behind my back? At least I'm open about being with attractive, wealthy men-and frankly, I'm enjoying myself. Is that what bothers you, Roger? That they outshine you in every way?"


For a moment, Marilee found herself at a loss,recognizing that after divorce, Alexia had become someone bolder and far more incisive than before.


Fury clouded Roger's thoughts after her biting words. "You're just leaning on other people! None of your success is truly your own!"


"That's nonsense. If I end up with what I want, that's ability in my book." Alexia leaned in, voice playful."And if we're splitting hairs, Roger, everything you call your own comes courtesy of the Gibson family.Connections, money, influence-tell me, what have you ever built yourself?"


He bristled, retorting, "I was born with those things!That's different!"


Her gaze turned cold. "Does that make you some kind of noble? You inherit everything, never feel a hint of embarrassment, and still judge me for taking advantage of what I have. Don't kid yourself-there are plenty of people out there with more brains and drive than you. Strip away your family's legacy and ask yourself what's left before you point fingers at me."


Anger flared in Roger's eyes-her last words had struck exactly where he was most vulnerable.


Even Marilee, who usually kept quiet in such spats,couldn't help lashing out. "You're banking on youth and a pretty face, Alexia! Let's see how long that gets you. One day, you'll be tossed aside just like anyone else!"


A spark of mischief lit Alexia's face as she arched a brow. "So you do see the value in beauty, after all?Good to know you're not completely blind."


Marilee's expression faltered, momentarily thrown off.





Irritation simmered beneath her calm, and for the first time, she could truly understand Roger's anger-her own thoughts scattered with frustration.


"What's got everyone so animated over here?"


Waylon's approach drew Alexia's attention, and she turned to find his keen eyes fixed on the group,
searching for answers.


She replied with a smile, "Nothing major. Just a bit of conversation, that's all."


Waylon's gaze swept over Roger and Marilee, then landed back on Alexia. "People like that will only drag you down. Best not to keep their company."


A visible tremor ran through Roger as those words landed.



With an easy movement, Alexia slipped her hand into the crook of Waylon's arm, nodding inagreement."Believe me, I'd rather not, but I still have to wrap up this divorce." Her attention shifted back to Roger,and her eyes turned frosty. "Be at the courthouse at nine tomorrow morning. Don't make me send someone to fetch you."



Roger struggled to hide the flood of emotion that washed over him-shock, humiliation, and even fear flickering in his eyes. Alexia caught every nuance.


Detecting the cloud over her mood, Waylon gently took her hand. "Let's get out of here."


Side by side, Alexia and Waylon strolled off, while Roger and Marilee were left behind, shivering beneath the chilly night air.


Soon after, the car carried Alexia back to her hotel.As the vehicle rolled to a stop, a thought surfaced.She reached for the necklace and addressed the man beside her. "I should give this necklace back to you now."
 
###Chapter 39 An Apology
Bathed in the gentle light, Waylon's features took on a golden warmth. "You don't have to give the necklace back. I want you to wear it."


Alexia shook her head. "I really can't keep it-it's far too extravagant."


"Alexia, consider it my way of making amends." With a small gesture, he lifted his phone and waggled it in front of her. "By the way, unblock my number."


Alexia retorted, "You were the first to block me,seven years ago. I only did it to get back at you."


"That's why the necklace is an apology," Waylon replied, a gentle smile touching his lips as he met her eyes. "I'll take the blame for everything. The person l was back then... let's just say, I wouldn't blame you for being upset. I'm asking for a little forgiveness."


Rarely did anyone see Waylon's guarded exterior fall away. The sudden tenderness in his tone left little room for resistance.



Looking into his earnest smile, Alexia found herself unable to offer a single cutting word.


Inwardly, she scolded herself for being so easily disarmed by his sincerity.


A sly glimmer entered her gaze. "You know, I'm not nearly as childish as you were back then." As the necklace's story drifted through her mind, she happened to glance down at his hand, noticing his fingers were bare, with no ring to be found.


A quiet breath escaped Alexia, though a peculiar uncertainty remained beneath her composure,something she couldn't quite name.


"I'll accept your apology gift," she said at last, "but l owe you a favor in return. If you ever need anything,just ask and I'll help."


Waylon offered an easy nod. "You can count on it.l won't hesitate."
She gave a simple acknowledgment. "Good."


The following day brought Alexia to the entrance of Elite Bar, where she was set to meet Andre.


Elite Bar, known throughout Afoross for its exclusive atmosphere, had always attracted investors from every corner of the city. Years back, the Garden of Eden had poured significant resources into securing a stake.



Making her way to the reserved booth, Alexia discovered Andre had not yet arrived. She ordered a pair of whiskies and settled in to wait. Not long after,a server approached, placing an unfamiliar bottle in front of her with care.



Her eyes landed on the label, confusion etching her brow. "I don't remember ordering this."


"Compliments of a gentleman, over there," the waiter explained, gesturing towards a direction.


Curiosity led her gaze across the room to a rough-edged man draped in confidence, a woman in striking, over-the-top attire hanging on his arm. The woman, with nails painted a dazzling red, drew a cigarette from a gold case and pressed it between his lips.


Drawing in the cigarette, he let smoke drift lazily from his lips. Noticing a pair of eyes on him, he shifted his gaze toward Alexia.


Alexia spoke up without hesitation. "Take this bottle back. I'm not interested."



A flicker of unease crossed the waiter's face. By then, the man had already sauntered over, intent clear in every step.


With every detail in place-hair meticulously styled,shirt hanging loose around his frame, a high-end watch glinting at his wrist-he gave Alexia a lingering look. His tone was casual, but his intent unmistakable. "You free later?"



Her reply cut like ice. "Leave."


For a heartbeat, surprise registered on his face, and a hush fell over the table. The waiter, caught between them, stayed rooted to the spot.


The tension hung until the man broke it with a low chuckle, eyes flickering with intrigue. "Do you know wholam?"


Alexia offered no reply, allowing the silence to stretch uncomfortably.


Right as he seemed ready to push further, another voice broke in. Andre appeared, words sharp."Darling, isn't this our date? Who is this guy?"


Both men locked eyes, each sizing up the other.


Andre didn't bother to hide his irritation. "Who are you? Why are you in our way?"


Mopping his brow nervously, the waiter interjected,"This is Mr. Vinson Hardy-he owns a stake in Elite Bar."



Recognition briefly flickered in Andre's eyes before he masked it with a calm stare. "Shareholder or not,you don't get to crash our date. Harassing customers isn't exactly good manners, is it? Is this the way Tripp Webster runs things around here? Go fetch him."


The mention of the owner's name brought both Vinson and the waiter up short.


Vinson's demeanor shifted, his confidence fading just a touch. "Let's not blow this out of proportion.Just a harmless mix-up. No reason to drag Mr.Webster into it. I meant no offense-only wanted to introduce myself. I'll cover your bill as an apology."


A roll of Andre's eyes said it all. "We can handle our own tab, believe me."


A storm cloud crossed Vinson's face. With a lingering, disappointed look at Alexia-who still refused to meet his eyes-he turned away and stalked off.



Andre sat down with a dramatic flourish.


Alexia wasted no time, her eyes sharp. "Vinson Hardy -does that name mean anything to you?"
###Chapter 40 They've Been Long Planning Her Comeback
Andre rubbed his nose. "You never miss a detail, do you? That man used to have quite the reputation in Edevor's financial world. He was tangled up with the Garden of Eden a while back, though I never dealt with him myself."



Suspicion glimmered in her eyes as Alexia asked,"Then why did he target me just now?"


With an easy shrug, he replied, "Chances are-he just wanted a bit of company. You know how men can be."



Alexia's stare grew colder. "Does this have anything to do with my identity as Luna?"


"No need to panic. Your cover is Tier 1 classified." He lifted both hands, all reassurance. "After everything we've survived together, you're still wary of us?"
 Deciding not to argue further, Alexia fished a slim chip from her bag and passed it over. "This is what you asked for."


The chip vanished into Andre's pocket as his eyes brightened. "You pulled it out on your own? And the crown?"



"I'm holding onto that."


A heavy sigh escaped him, all for dramatic effect."Are you telling me you couldn't part with the crown?The one Waylon paid a fortune for?"


Alexia didn't flinch. "The Garden of Eden never owned the crown. All you people wanted was the chip inside. It's simple-finish the work, and I take my share."



Andre's disbelief was plain. "You used to be more generous,you know."


She lifted her glass, letting the whiskey linger on her tongue. "This time, I owe someone more than I can pay back.I had to use Waylon's help to wrap this up.
Her C..That was a one-time thing. Don't ask me to repeat it."


"You're actually covering for him now? You two couldn't stand each other before, and suddenly you're friends?" Andre's face was the picture of heartbreak. He had once suggested Alexia get closer to Waylon, but he never thought it would actually work.



Alexia's warning glance was sharp enough to cut glass."The Garden of Eden has no claim on Waylon.He's got nothing to do with us, and that's how it's going to stay."


He blew out a breath, sounding exasperated."Why not use him for our benefit? You think he's too delicate? Be honest, you took this job to fix things with him, didn't you?"


She hesitated for a second before responding in an even voice, "If that's how you see it, I'm not going to change your mind."


In Andre's imagination, a tiny version of himself sobbed into a tiny handkerchief.
There was a swveet ache to all of it. That was the taste lingering in the air.


After all this time, the old Alexia was finally back. But now, her fierce devotion seemed pointed at the wrong cause.


Andre pouted, but only for a moment, before changing the subject. "Let's drop it. Did you remember what I mentioned about your history?There's new information."



His hand disappeared into his bag, and he pulled out a folder, passing it over.


As Alexia turned each page, her eyes grew sharper and more alert.



Noticing her reaction, Andre let out a weary sigh."Marilee's had the Styx Virus since she was born-a variant so uncommon that most doctors have never even heard of it. Years ago, Brookline had access to the top medical care, so they tucked her away there,keeping her existence under wraps. Security was tight. Secrecy was everything-after all, the Styx Virus carries a filthy reputation. If the truth ever broke out, the Jenkins family's reputation would have been ruined overnight. Until a cure came along,hiding her was their only option."


He paused, giving her a moment to absorb it all, then continued, "And the real reason they brought you in?Both you and Marilee share a blood type that's nearly impossible to find. No blood banks carry it, not here or anywhere else. Looking back, haven't you spent your childhood in hospital rooms, rolling up your sleeves? Every single drop was for Marilee."



A quiet confession slipped from Alexia. "They always said my blood went to one of my mother's distant relatives. Some girl who was supposed to be just my age."


Andre let out a snort, his tone laced with sarcasm."Typical. Grown-ups have a habit of feeding kids convenient lies."


Shadow crossed her expression. "If all I was meant to be was a donor, they could've just told the truth and adopted me. Why bother pretending I was really their
child?"


"Simple. Other families were interested in you back then. The Williams couple-they were right there in the running. Tell me, if the Jenkins couple hadn't gone out of their way to act like your real parents,would you have picked them?"


The truth was plain-she would not have.


She'd always favored the Williams couple. Without the perfect web of lies the Jenkins couple spun-creating an entire history and identity for her-there was no way she would have picked them.


Alexia's tone was sharp as a blade. "After the Styx Virus was cured, Marlee recovered and started her career in the showbiz, becoming a sensation soon...That was all orchestrated by them too? They've been long planning her comeback?"


Andre nodded. "Absolutely. Nothing draws the spotlight like a carefully crafted celebrity. When you can control the narrative, you control everything. The minute Marilee's fairytale return goes public, nobody will remember you were ever part of the picture."

###Chapter 41 Familial Love
"The Jenkins couple didn't stop there. They even arranged your marriage with Roger. Sure, the two families used to be friends, but that bond was broken a long time ago. The Jenkins family have since thrown their support behind other political camps. That marriage was never about unity. It was a scheme to push the Gibson family aside for good. The girl they chose for Zayne came from a family that openly opposes the Gibson family politically."



Andre let out a sigh, shaking his head. "Honestly,Alexia,things would have been so different if Marilee had any real ambition. Without her meddlingin your marriage and ruining her name in high society, she would have stayed the perfect girl, living off your blood since she was little."



Every move the Jenkins family made seemed to clear the way for Marilee, guiding her toward a life most people could only dream about.


Suddenly, the reason for all the snide remarks, cold shoulders, and constant belittling from the Jenkins family became painfully clear to Alexia.



Parents, after all, chart their children's futures with ruthless efficiency.

Yet she was never their real daughter. All they saw in her was a walking blood supply.


Their hearts had always been set on their true child.Whatever scraps of kindness they tossed her way felt more like charity than real affection. In their minds,giving a girl from nowhere the chance to climb higher was generosity itself.


A bitter smile tugged at Alexia's lips as these truths sank in.



"Now I understand why they discarded me at Marilee's birthday party. They'd squeezed out every last drop of use, so tossing me aside was easy." She knocked back her drink in one motion, setting her glass down with a determined thud.



Andre's expression softened. "You know, it's okay to cry if you need to."



"What reason do I have to cry?" Alexia clung to the glass. "I was foolish enough to believe that if I became someone else, I might finally matter to them."


She grew up trying to fix herself. Always second-guessing. Always wondering if she was falling short.And always believing that if she worked harder, they'd finally see her.


She once convinced herself that excellence would be the key. Striving to come out on top in everything, she gathered trophies and certificates. None of it mattered.What she received in return was a wall of cold indifference, her efforts swallowed up in silence. Not once did she hear even the faintest praise.



One time, with hopeful eyes, she asked her mother,"Mom, aren't you proud I got first place?"


Her mother looked past her, voice as cold as her stare "In this family, it's fine to be average."



Average.



The word haunted her. So she forced herself into the background, learning to live quietly, her achievements dimmed. To everyone else, she was a prodigy who burned out far too soon.



Thinking about it now, the truth almost made her laugh. They were never going to let her stand out. If she ever shone too brightly, Marilee would only be cast further into the shadows.



"Since it was nothing but a lie from the beginning,l want no part of it now," she declared.


Resolute as ever, Andre replied, "You're far too good for them. The Jenkins family will never understand what they gave up."



Years passed, and Alexia's efforts for the Jenkins family never went unnoticed by those around her. Her worth had always overshadowed Marilee's.


That all changed once the truth surfaced-she had no intention of lifting another finger for the Jenkins family.


Rising from her seat, Alexia threw Andre a look."Contact Bart Begum. Call off the international acquisition with Jenkins Group, and make sure the Jenkins family is forced out of Northbay."


Andre's eyes lit up, a grin breaking across his face."Consider it done!"



Both stepped into the main bar area, where a bold runway show was underway, music pounding through the room.



A burst of drama erupted just as the last bar girl strutted out. Some brute reached for her lingerie strap,only for her to retaliate by snatching a wine bottle and smashing it over his head.



The crash of glass echoed.



The party mood vanished instantly as everyone saw the man collapse, blood staining his hair.



Within seconds, the girl was thrown to the floor by the man's companions, and the scene turned to chaos,arguments and shouts filling the air. Staff scrambled to bring order, rushing to fetch the manager


Alexia's eyes locked on the woman sprawled on stage.curiosity flashing.


Watching her closely, Andre caught the shift in Alexia's expression and couldn't help but ask, "You seem to recognize her. Is she a friend?"



Without breaking her focus, Alexia answered, "We're not friends, but she's not just anyone. If I'm not mistaken, she's Dracfield Military Tech's chief engineer."



"Dracfield Military Tech? That's the up-and-coming arms company fighting us for contracts. That's top-secret information. Where'd you learn that? Don't tell me you two have some history?" Andre's curiosity was piqued.



She answered flatly, "That's between me and her."With that, she stepped forward to get a better look at the woman's face.



Drawing nearer, she noticed someone had draped a man's jacket over the woman's bare shoulders-and right next to her stood Elton.



The moment Elton spotted Alexia, a sly grin flickered as his gaze drifted from her to Andre. "Well, isn't this an interesting little reunion?"
###Chapter 42 | Want This Woman
Alexia brushed off a sudden sense of discomfort,steadying herself with composure. "Andre and I are just friends."



At that, Andre leaned in and added, "Friends for now."



With a smirk, Elton gave Andre a look up and down,clearly not convinced, and teased, "So you're pursuing her,huh?"



Andre scowled at the remark. "Why do you care so much?"



With a false air of seriousness, Elton shrugged."Doesn't bother me at all. I just wonder what Waylon would say if he caught wind of this."



Surprise flickered across Alexia's features. "He wouldn't bother with something like that."


Before Elton could continue,the manager appeared,his shirt damp from sweat and a nervous smile plastered on his face.



"Pardon me for stepping in, everyone. What happened today was never our intention. We'll handle the disruptive woman and make things right with Mr. Ortiz.Elite Bar will pay for all medical expenses."



Some of Healy Ortiz's crew, still angry, spoke up."Your money means nothing to us. She went after our boss. If we let her off easy, how can he walk into a room with his head held high? Stop wasting time and hand her over!"



Caught between a rock and a hard place, the manager hesitated.WVhile Healy had a bit of money, the girls trained by Elite Bar brought in far greater profits. And the said girl had a future worth protecting. Letting them have her would ruin all of that.



The manager hesitated.



"What's there to think about? You're holding on to her like she's worth more than our boss!"



Alexia's gaze drifted toward the woman, head bowed and features hidden, saying nothing. Right as she opened her mouth, Elton cut in, "You think your boss,looking the way he does, could measure up to someone like her?"



That comment set off laughter all around. Just as the group was about to respond, the manager bent at the waist before Elton.r. Clark, please don't take offense."



The moment that name left his lips, Healy's men grew uneasy. It was clear now that Elton wasn't a man they wanted to cross.



With the hall now silent, Elton offered a cold,dismissive laugh, then turned to the woman. "Look up.Let me see your face."



His voice left no room for questions, sending a chill through the crowd.



Uncertainty flickered across the woman's face as she slowly raised her chin.



The instant Alexia caught sight of those jewel-bright green eyes, a jolt of shock ran through her.



There was no mistaking the resemblance.



"She's breathtaking!"


"I've never seen anyone so beautiful. Now l understand why she saved her entrance for last-she outshines them all!"



Andre, caught off guard, found himself impressed.Still, unease crept in the longer he studied her.Leaning closer to Alexia, he whispered, "How could someone like the chief engineer at Dracfield Military Tech end up in a place like this? Even if she's undercover,putting someone that gifted at risk makes no sense. If anything happens to her, what'll become of their entire team?"
Alexia could only look at him, at a loss for words.


While whispers passed among the crowd, Elton knelt down,eyes fixed on the woman before letting a sly grin spread across his lips. "I want this woman."


Excitement stirred beneath the manager's anxious exterior, barely hidden by his mask of professionalism."To catch your eye is a blessing for her."


Elton brushed off the compliment. "And let me make this clear. I have no patience for people drooling over what's mine. Break their legs and toss them out."



The moment his words landed,fear swept through the group. "Mr. Clark! We'd never cross you, please believe us!" But the manager, following orders,summoned the guards and had them dragged away without hesitation.



Pained yells soon echoed from the entrance, chilling everyone left behind.


With the ordeal done, Elton was ready to lead the woman away when Alexia suddenly called out, "Kyra Francis?"



The name made Elton stop in his tracks, and the woman's steps faltered beside him.



He turned back and asked, "Who did you just call?"
Searching the woman's face, Alexia spotted uncertainty and offered a small smile. "I'm sorry; l thought you were someone else. May I know your name?"



"Bella Coleman," the woman replied. Her reply was gentle, her tone softer than anyone expected.


"Please forgive me," said Alexia, retrieving a business card from her bag and offering it. "If you ever need help,call me. I'll have your back."



Elton's jaw clenched as he struggled to maintain his polished smile. "Alexia, what are you trying to imply?"
###Chapter 43 The Real Trouble Is Just Beginning
With a light laugh, Alexia replied, "Honestly, there's nothing behind it. I just think Bella's really stunning."


Something in Bella's gaze caught Elton's attention as she looked at Alexia, her eyes bright. He pressed his lips together,reached for the business card, and gave it a once-over. Surprise flashed across his face."You've started working as a professor at Afoross University?"


"That's right. You're always welcome to sit in on a class,you know."



Not missing a beat, Elton shook his head. "That won't be happening. Academic lectures put me to sleep.And honestly, I'd rather keep my distance. Waylon would have my head if he found out."



A glint of playful challenge sparked in Alexia's eyes."You say that, but there was a time when you and !were thick as thieves, Beauty Elton."


"Alexia, stop calling me that, I mean it!"Elton snapped,clearly recalling some unpleasant memories.


"I'm only telling the truth! Back then, you were the best-looking boy in the neighborhood," Alexia said,pretending to be innocent.


Frustration crept across Elton's face as he remembered how playful Alexia could be.


"Just wait. I won't forget this," he grumbled, cutting the exchange short and marching Bella out the door.


Meanwhile,Vinson stood outside, taking in the whole encounter. He watched as Elton helped Bella into a waiting car before climbing into his own and turning the key.



Inside his car, Elton still simmered with frustration.He pulled out his phone and fired off a message to Waylon.



"Alexia was teasing me again!"



A few moments later, a short reply lit up his screen.



"Handle it yourself."



Elton stared at the message, letting out a humorless laugh. "You let her get away with too much," he muttered to himself.



Meanwhile, Jenkins Group headquarters stood bright against the night.


Behind the wide glass windows, the CEO's office glowed.Zayne slumped in his chair after a marathon of meetings, kneading his temples and wishing for a break.



A sharp knock interrupted his thoughts.



"Come in."



His secretary rushed inside, a stack of documents gripped in her arms and concern written all over her face. "Mr. Jenkins, urgent news from Northbay. Bart Begum just backed out of our multinational acquisition deal. Goldrose Consortium has withdrawn their investment from Jenkins Group. And the Wooddale factory is now facing forced closure next month!"



The moment the news landed, Zayne snapped upright.His eyes widened. "What did you just say? That acquisition went through just last month. We haven't even reached the second week since then. Why would Bart abruptly pull the plug and toss aside all cooperation?"


The secretary's face showed her confusion and alarm."We've tried to gather some clues quietly, but Goldrose Consortium won't say a word. They're keeping everything under wraps!"



Irritation boiling within him, Zayne wasted no time and placed an international call. When the line picked up,he pushed his temper aside, aiming to resolve things.
"This is Zayne Jenkins. Put me through to Mr. Bart Begum. What? He's asleep? At two in the afternoon?You want to speak instead? Can you really explain what's going on? This partnership means everything to Jenkins Group. We've bent over backward to show goodwill, and now Goldrose Consortium is bailing halfway through. Even a company with your reputation can't just walk away from a commitment like this!"



The secretary observed the tense exchange,staying quiet and not daring to interrupt.


A few moments passed before laughter crackled through the receiver, cold and mocking, slicing through the heavy silence.


"Mr. Jenkins, we see why you're upset, but frankly, we never considered Jenkins Group an equal partner. We hold the power here, and our decisions are final.You never had any real leverage in this deal."


Zayne's humiliation boiled over. He slammed his fist onto the desk, the sharp crack making his secretary flinch.



Through clenched teeth, he spat, "You have no shame at all!"



Unbothered, the other party replied, "By the way, Mr.Begum wanted you to know. While the Jenkins family's luck has run out, the real trouble is just  beginning."


That last line hit Zayne like a slap. His skin prickled as dread washed over him. He fumbled for a response,but the call ended without warning.


Reeling from the insult, he lashed out-one furious swipe sent a priceless vase tumbling, shattering into pieces on the floor.


The sound echoed in the office, as sharp and final as the blow to his pride.



Cradling his head in his hands, Zayne slumped in his chair,pain pounding behind his eyes.



No one knew the truth better than he did-Jenkins Group looked strong on the outside, but inside, every step forward felt like quicksand.
###Chapter 44 Blacklisted

For years, Jenkins Group rode high on the back of entertainment investments, raking in fortunes while the virtual economy boomed. Recently though.market winds had shifted. The digital landscape shrank overnight, leaving the group searching for solid ground.



Instead of retreating, Zayne plotted a bold new direction.Drawing from the expertise they'd gained in show business, he pushed the company toward tangible industries. He lounched beauty and fashion lines, using Marilee's celebrity status to promote their products both domestically and internationally.



Competition, however, was cutthroat. Even with production costs kept low, real profits and lasting brand power remained elusive. Every advertising dollar had to count, so Zayne set his sights on joining the World Luxury Association, hoping the stamp of approval would open new doors.



Gaining such recognition as a fresh, local brand,though, was an ordeal fit for a Greek tragedy Roadblocks rose at every turn, each more daunting than the last.



Waiting wasn't an option. Jenkins Group needed allies, and in Northbay, only one name held enough weight: Goldrose Consortium.Their network stretched everywhere, and their reputation was unmatched.



Frankly, Goldrose Consortium hadn't lied; Jenkins Group's credentials fell short of their standards. Still,why extend an olive branch if they truly saw the group as beneath them?



Just now, they'd ridiculed Zayne's efforts. Yet not so long ago, the same voices had praised his sharp mind and quick judgment. Had their admiration been genuine, or was it all an act?



Those thoughts bounced around in Zayne's mind until a single name interruptad-Luna


He still had Luna. She was a legend in the finance world, a mysterious presence he'd encountered online by sheer luck. Every crisisthat had threatened to sink him before, Luna had steered him through. Even the connection with Goldrose Consortium could be traced back to her.



If Luna agreed to lend her hand once more, there might yet be a way forward


Excitement replaced his doubts. Zayne's fingers moved quickly. He tapped into an old chat, searching for the familiar golden star icon, and sent off a message,hoping for a lifeline.
The message bounced back, undelivered.


Staring at the screen, Zayne felt a sharp rush of anxiety.





He had been blacklisted.



His secretary, catching the change in his expression.spoke up quietly. "Is something wrong, sir?"


Not a single word left Zayne's lips for several minutes.Fear held him still, rooting him to the spot.


She was the one who had asked for his friendship.Why was she the first to walk away?


Despite all the admiration and hope he'd placed in her,she vanished without leaving a trace or a reason.



Now that Luna had disappeared, what future did Jenkins Group have?



Confusion swirled in his mind. Luna had always been his guiding star. Now, she was gone, and he felt completely lost.



At Last, with a rawness in his tone that betrayed his desperation, he gave an order. "Let everyone know Search everywhere. Spare nothing-time, money,whatever it costs. I have to find Luna."



Morning arrived, and Alexia set her moving plans in motion.


With only a few bags in tow, she barely felt the burden-Newhall Garden was ready for her from the start. Even 5o, Ada's excitement about lending a hand was impossible to refuse.


Crossing into the property, they passed a woman whose makeup and hair seemed meticulouslyarranged.Not long after, the woman slowed her step, paused,and discreetly lifted her phone to capture a photo of them from behind.



The image went straight to Marilee's inbox.



Dina Hampton's fingers danced over the screen."Marilee, isn't this Alexia?"



A frown flickered across Marilee's face as she glanced at the image. "That's her. What's up?"


Dina answered, "She's just moved into Newhall Garden!Your family must be feeling extra charitable, handing over a place worth close to a billion. I've spent half my life in showbiz and I still don't have the credit to own a home there!"



Marilee replied, "You're giving us too much credit. We never gifted her anything-she must be renting."



Dina retorted, "Impossible. I watched her go into the exclusive section. Those properties aren't for lease.
just for sale."



"Then someone's footing the bill for her. She's probably living off some rich benefactor."


Dina didn't hesitate. "Who could it be? Which powerful player has pockets that deep?"


Marilee pressed her teeth into her lower lip. Talk about Waylon and Alexia always traveled quietly among the upper crust. People preferred to keep those suspicions under wraps rather than risk saying anything out loud.


Bringing up Waylon's name in casual conversation felt pointless to her It would only boost Alexia's image.


She responded, "Honestly, who can say? My guess is she's latched onto some older man with money and peculiar preferences. The way I see it, Alexia's got nothing of her own-no job, no prospects, and after her divorce, even less to offer. There's no way I could outmatch her knack for this sort of thing."



A rush of sympathy washed over Dina. "That woman has no shame. She's taken so much from you, yet she still gets to live the easy life. How is that fair?Whoever her backer is, he's probably just stringing her along. If Alexia's reputation wasn't still intact, she would've been left behind ages ago!"



As Marilee read those words, a clever scheme began to form in her mind.
###Chapter 45 You And Waylon Have Something Going On
Stepping into Alexia's new place, Ada looked around with surprise. "Impressive spot! Sunlight pours in, the view is gorgeous, and I have to say-your sense of style shines through. Shame it's not a little bigger,though!"



Handing over a glass of wine, Alexia smiled. "This is perfect for one person. More space would only echo with emptiness."


After taking a sip, Ada shrugged. "You know, if you're ever craving company, just bring a man around.They're good for something,right? People are saying you and Waylon have something going on. I honestly thought his invite to that gala was just a setup, but clearly, I was off the mark. Word is Roger embarrassed himself at the auction. Had I known, I'd have begged my brother to get me a ticket. What a scene l missed!"She gave her thigh a playful smack, the regret plain in her voice.



Calmly, Alexia lifted her glass and took a sip. "Roger had it coming."


 
That comment brought out a mischievous glint in  Ada's eye. "Still, wasn't it Waylon who gave him trouble? Did you ever corner Waylon about why he came to your rescue? Is he really interested in you,or is that just talk?"



In that instant, Alexia's thoughts flickered to Waylon's unadorned hand. "Why would he look my way? Even if he did, it wouldn't be in any romantic sense. I actually asked him, you know. He told me he was just doing his good deed for the day."



At those words, Ada nearly choked on her wine, eyes wide with disbelief.



A small smile tugged at Alexia's lips as she passed over a tissue. "The answer's plain as day. He spotted my struggles and stepped in like some Good Samaritan. Might as well call him the neighborhood's patron saint."



Ada, deflated by her friend's indifference, shook her head and said, "Waylon's in a league of his own. If anyone manages to land him, I'll be seriously impressed."



Suddenly, a sharp knock echoed from the entrance.



Answering the knock, Alexia found a young girl wearing bear pajamnas, cheeks flushed. "Um, excuse me! My cat took a flying leap off my balcony.I think it might have ended up on yours."
Both women hurried outside to investigate. There on the balcony, a frail-looking cat lay still, one leg at an odd angle. Blood had pooled beneath it



Without hesitation, Alexia scooped up the injured animal. Ada's voice rose in alarm. "That's awful! We need to rush it to the vet right now!"



Wringing her hands, the little girl pleaded, "Could you please help me?"


Her request hung in the air as a harsh call sliced through the moment. "Betsey! Where on earth have you gone this time? You're nothing but trouble!"



Fear flashed across the child's face. She shrank back,glancing nervously toward the doorway, where a stern -looking middle-aged woman had appeared.



The woman swept into the room, face twisted in anger. "So this is where you've been hiding!"


Reacting instantly, Betsey Adams slipped behind Alexia for protection. Ada, catching the storm brewing in the woman's eyes, retorted, "Are you her grandmother?"



A flicker of irritation crossed the woman's face.I'm the nanny."


"So you're the nanny? You sure act like you're her grandmother." Ada's gaze traveled up and down the woman, her voice dripping with sarcasm.


Realizing Ada wasn't someone to cross, the woman's bravado faded. Instead, she settled for shooting daggers at Betsey. "Get over here!"



A tiny, wavering voice came from Betsey. "| just wanted them to help take thekitten to see a doctor."



A quick look at the injured cat in Alexia's arms drew nothing but a cold smirk from the woman. "Still fussing over that ragged little creature, are you?"



Disgust sharpened her tone. "You're seven, aren't you?Shouldn't you know better by now? All you ever do is make trouble for your mother."



That struck a nerve with Alexia. Her eyebrows drew together as she scoffed, "Is that really the way you speak to a child? At your age, I'd expect you to know basic decency."



A flush crept up the woman's neck. "You've got a lot of nerve, talking back to me. Whatever's going on here, it's none of your business. Family matters don't need outsiders meddling!" 2



Without waiting for a reply, she lunged for Betsey's ear. "How many times do I have to call you? Are you pretending not to hear me?"
###Chapter 46 The Legendary Luna
Ada blocked Betsey with a swift movement, batting away the nanny's hand. "You really have some gall! My own nanny never dared to make decisions for me,let alone treat me this way."



Bending down, Alexia extended her phone toward Betsey. "If saving this cat really matters to you, talk to your mother yourself. Tell her what's happening. After that, I'll bring it to the vet."



Tension stiffened the older woman, and Betsey looked completely thrown, uncertainty flickering across her features.



Alexia fixed her with a sharp stare. "No one else can do this for you. If you want change, you've got to be the one to act first."



Betsey's gaze dropped. "But Mommy's so busy. She's always at work, always in some meeting. I don't know if | can..."



The woman lunged for the phone. "Why bother?Betsey's mother is the general manager of Cosmo Biotech. She barely slows down long enough to breathe, let alone deal with a pet. She won't care about any of this!"


Alexia reacted quickly, pulling her phone away just in time. "If you refuse to call, there's nothing left to say.To be honest, this cat doesn't have much time. You might want to start thinking about where you'll bury it."


As the words hung in the air, small fingers tugged at her skirt. Betsey, eyes brimming with tears, whispered,"I'll make the call."



Alexia offered her the phone without another word.



Meanwhile, Cosmo Biotech's conference room felt heavy with pressure.



At the head of the table, Serena Adams wore a crisp black suit, her attention fixed on the presentations unfolding before her.



"Our latest innovation made it through development,but now we're up against fresh trouble. There's a mysterious group out there spreading rumors and attacking our reputation. They've joined forces with hedge funds, shorting our stock and trying to sink our value for their own gain."



"They're betting against us! At this pace, we might be heading for disaster. Who did we cross to deserve this?"


A worried voice rose from the group. "Ms. Adams,what's our next move?"

Serena paused, her silence stretching across the table."When you stand above the rest, you're the first to get hit. This wave has already knocked over several biopharma firms, here and overseas. Now, they're coming straight for our new launch. We have to brace ourselves."



Resigned sighs echoed among the shareholders."That's easier to say than to pull off.Where would we even turn for backup? We're in the middle of major changes. We're nothing like those financial heavyweights-we're just scientists and developers.This isn't our arena!"



"If we want someone who can actually outmaneuver Wall Street, it has to be Luna. She's at the top of the game right now. There's no one better."



Just hearing Luna's name sent a ripple of energy through the room.



Skepticism quickly followed. "But Luna's a legend for a reason-nobody's met her, not in person. How would we even get her attention? Big-money players have tried and failed, offering fortunes just for a meeting Nobody's figured out how to contact her."


"Let's not waste time chasing shadows. We should look for answers within reach."



Tension hung heavy over the table as Serena's phone  started to buzz.



Her frown deepened at the sight of an unfamiliar number, but she rose from her seat and slipped out to take the call.



"Hello?" Serena answered, uncertain.



"It's me, Mommy." Betsey's voice sounded small on the other end.



Relief softened Serena's features the moment she recognized her daughter. "'What's the matter, love?"



"Ginger fell off the balcony and hurt his leg really bad.There's blood everywhere. I want to ask the lady downstairs if she can bring him to the hospital.Would that be alright?"



"Of course it is. But you really don't have to bother someone else. Couldn't Chloe handle it instead?"



Betsey hesitated before replying, "Chloe probably won't want to help."



Serena's concern grew as she listened, a frown knitting her brow. Something about this felt wrong.



Alexia then took charge, her voice steady as she spoke into the phone.


"Yes, Ms. Adams? I'm Alexia. I'm giving you my number. I'll look after thecat for now. As for the vet bill, you can forget about it. But if you really want to pay me back, you can compensate me for the headache instead."



While she spoke, Alexia glanced sideways at Chloe Barnes, the nanny, who looked as if she might bolt at any second.



"To be honest, I couldn't believe what I saw. Your nanny strutted around, tossing out commands like she ran the building, and the poor girl kept apologizing.For a minute, I almost mistook Betsey for her maid. So you can imagine how surprised I was to learn she's just a nanny."



Chloe's cheeks drained of color at the accusation."That's not true! I never acted that way! How could you twist my words like this?"



Alexia clicked her tongue. "See that? She's coming unglued all over again."
###Chapter 47 Waylon Was Clearly Making A Move O...

"That nanny's temper is downright vicious. Poor Betsey-so soft, so fragile-she couldn't even get her injured cat to a vet. Honestly, how she endures that environment every day is beyond me," Alexia said.



The message couldn't have been more obvious Serena,quick on the uptake, recalled the uncertainty in Betsey's voice from earlier. Rage simmered beneath her calm. "Thank you for letting me know. I'll deal with this personally. Appreciate it, Alexia."



"No trouble at all."



As soon as the call disconnected, Chloe exploded. She lunged at Alexia with all the fury of someone unhinged. "You cost me my job, you bitch!"



But Alexia's reflexes were swift. Chloe's wrist was caught in an iron grip, then forced backward with brutal efficiency.



A cry of pain ripped from Chloe's lips as she collapsed to the floor.



Betsey recoiled, eyes wide. Alexia, her expression like ice, looked down at the woman sprawled in agony.
"Ada, get security up here. Let them know there's been a break-in and I've been attacked. Have this woman thrown out and barred from the property for good. If they hesitate, I'll call the police myself. She doesn't own an apartment here, yet she stormed in and tried to attack me. I doubt Newhall Garden wants that stain on their reputation."



Ada sprang into action, her voice edged with disdain."She's lucky all you're doing is calling security. People like her forget where they stand!"



A mocking smile curved Ada's lips as she added, "At your age, your own kids must be grown by now.Where do they work, I wonder? Which companies? No answer? That's fine-I'll dig it up myself."


Chloe finally seemed to realize the gravity of her actions.Fear replaced anger. "Please! I lost control! It wasn't on purpose! Don't punish my children for my mistake. I'm begging you!"



Alexia's smirk was merciless. "Oh, now you're frightened? Maybe you should've thought about that before mistreating someone else's child."



Chloe fell silent, stricken with dread. Security soon arrived, wasted no time, and escorted her off the premises.



The security staff rushed over,bowing their heads with  apologies. "Please forgive us for what happened,ladies. We'll be stepping up patrols to make sure nothing like this ever occurs again."



Turning her attention to Betsey, Alexia spoke gently."Head home now. I'll handle getting the cat checked out. Once it's all healed, you and your mom can come collect it together."



Tears shimmered in Betsey's eyes, gratitude written across her delicate features. "Thank you so much!"



With Betsey safely sent off, Alexia and Ada carried the injured cat straight to the vet.



On the ride over, Ada fumed, unable to let go of her anger. "That wasn't any accident. I'd bet anything that woman chucked the poor thing off the balcony.Cosmo Biotech, I know the name. The girl's mom must be Serena Adams. Who'd believe someone like her-such a powerhouse-could be fooled by someone so despicable?"



A puzzled look crossed Alexia's face. "Serena Adams is really that important?"


Ada didn't hesitate. "Absolutely. There aren't many women who've built their own empires in this business,but she did it. The whole Adams family is still standing because of her. Prof. Ellis's lab is even slated to collaborate with them on future projects."

Alexia grew quiet, mulling over Ada's words-right as her phone began to ring. Waylon's name lit up her screen.



"Where are you right now?" Waylon asked.



"I'm heading to the hospital," Alexia replied.



Her answer was barely out before Waylon's concern came through, sharper than before. "Are you hurt?"



With a quick glance at the ginger cat curled up in the pet carrier, Alexia reassured him, "Not me-a cat.I'm taking it to the vet. What's going on? Is there something you need?"



A moment of silence stretched between them,almost as if Waylon had let out a sigh of relief. "It's fine. Take care of your cat for now."



Alexia didn't let it slide. "Hold on. You wouldn't have called if there wasn't something up. Out with it!"



From the driver's seat, Ada glanced over, clearly intrigued.


Waylon's next words carried a soft, husky undertone that made his smooth voice even more captivating."It's nothing urgent. I'm in the middle of making glazed ribs and hit a wall. Figured you could help me out."
Ada's eyes widened in disbelief.


Could he be serious?



No one could deny that Alexia's glazed ribs were unforgettable-tender, rich, with just the right blend of sweetness and tang.



Still, for someone like Waylon-who could summon a Michelin chef with a single call-to need help in the kitchen?



Shock registered first for Alexia, realizing he was actually cooking. But then, concern replaced surprise as she picked up on the roughness in his voice. "You sound off. Are you sick? Did you run a fever and forget to take something?"



"Not yet," Waylon replied casually.



"And why haven't you taken anything?" Alexia asked.



A trace of stubbornness colored his answer. "Because I want glazed ribs, and nothing else will do."


Alexia's mind flashed back to the favor she still owed,and resignation crept in. "Alright, you win. Don't lay a finger on anything else. I'll get there as soon as I can!"



The call ended, and Alexia turned to Ada with a sheepish grin. "Ada, could you drop the cat at the vet  for me? I'll swing by as soon as I handle this."



Ada let out a long sigh. "Sure. It's not like anyone tells Waylon no. But honestly-are you even aware that



Confusion flickered in Alexia's eyes. "What are you trying to say?"


Waylon was clearly making a move on Alexia. Though the words hovered on her tongue, Ada thought better of voicing them. Some things were just better left unspoken.
###Chapter 48 Cooking For Him
Before heading over, Alexia made a quick stop at the pharmacy to grab something for a fever.



Stepping up to the front door of Waylon's home, she gave a gentle knock. He answered, wearing an ivory sweater, all long lines and quiet confidence.



There was something different about him here, away from the world. Gone was the hard edge. At home,he seemed softer-like a summer moonbeam, gentle and quietly striking.



When he noticed her standing frozen on the doorstep,he leaned closer, studying her face. "Why are you staring? You're blushing."



The sound of his voice snapped her out of it. She quickly pushed at his chest. "Back up. You're way too close."



He didn't bother resisting and let her through without complaint. Once inside, Alexia took in her surroundings. "Where's your housekeeper? Isn't she supposed to be looking after you?"



"She had to leave for family reasons," he said, the  words slipping out as though it barely mattered.



"What about everyone else?"



"None of them can handle glazed ribs right." A hint of annoyance flickered across his features. "And I can't stand strangers lingering around anyway."



Alexia reached into her bag and produced an electronic thermometer, pressing it to his forehead.



Her eyes widened as the numbers blinked on screen."You're burning up! And you still refuse to take medicine?"



"It's just a fever. I'lI be fine after some sleep." Waylon Looked as relaxed as ever, like it was nothing to worry about.



Alexia shot him a sharp look. "What if you end up frying your brain and can't think straight?"


A little smirk tugged at his lips. "Even then, I'd still be smarter than most."



Rolling her eyes, Alexia sighed. Trying a different approach, she warned him,"If you don't take your medicine, I'm not cooking those ribs."



Waylon didn't argue. He just fixed her with an intense stare. Even as her cheeks threatened to flush under his gaze,Alexia fought to keep calm. "Fine. No medicine,no ribs. I'm out."



She turned around and started for the door. But before she could leave, a firm hand caught her by the wrist.



She glanced over her shoulder, eyebrows raised.



With barely a word, Waylon finally reached for the fever tablets and moved to pour himself a glass of water.



Alexia watched him, satisfied. "That's more like it." She turned her attention to the kitchen.



Waiting on the counter was a plate piled with something mysterious. Brow furrowed, she called out,"What exactly is that mess supposed to be?"



Waylon trailed after her, hesitating before answering,"That was meant to be steak. Are you telling me it looks that bad?"



For a mnoment, Alexia just stared. She prodded at the plate, lifted a piece to her lips, and braced herself for the taste test. One bite in, her face twisted in horror.It took all her willpower not to spit it out then and there.
Noticing her distress. Waylon blinked in genuine confusion. He stepped closer, giving her an awkward pat on the back-a rare crack in his usual self-assurance. "Did it really taste that awful?"



Alexia waved him off, stumbling sideways as she chugged glass after glass of water.



When she could finally speak, her face was a patchwork of disbelief, accusation, and secondhand embarrassment. She muttered, "After seven years,your cooking still feels like a crime!"



He didn't reply right away, his expression shuttered and impossible to read.



Disasters in the kitchen had followed him for as long as anyone could remember. Even as a kid, his so-called "kitchen curse" was legendary.



That summer at camp, Alexia had been his unwitting partner in disaster. Both eager to impress, they had ended up on the same outdoor survival team,brimming with misplaced confidence and ready to show everyone up. They collected wild mushrooms with pride, eager to shine as model campers.



Waylon handled the cooking, while Alexia tried to help,unaware of what was coming.



Disaster struck in the form of food poisoning.
It might have stopped there, if not for the bonus round of wild hallucinations after she ate some mushrooms. Alexia could still recall her own outburst -tears, laughter, frantic dancing, and clutching Waylon while saying through tears, "Daddy, please don't leave me." Never before or since had she embarrassed herself quite so thoroughly.



Waylon had insisted the mushrooms were poisonous.Later lab tests revealed the truth-the mushrooms were safe. The problem was that they were undercooked.



People like Waylon, used to excelling at everything,found it impossible to accept defeat. He was convinced his next kitchen experiment would succeed.



Alexia, poor soul, became his unwilling taste tester again and again. It took her losing a noticeable amount of weight before he finally surrendered his spatula.



These memories made Alexia sigh



Tying an apron around her waist, she stepped up to the stove once more. Waylon hovered at her side, far too interested, watching every move as she worked on the pork glaze.

Finishing the sauce, Alexia handed him a spoonful.His eyes lit up with reckless anticipation, as though tasting victory for the first time.



Alexia shot him a look, clearly on guard. "Don't get any ideas."



Waylon angled his head thoughtfully."What if I tried a little more spice? It could really take the flavor up a notch."



Her voice left no room for argument. "Out of the question. Rule number one-just follow the recipe."



A visible wave of disappointment swept over him."That takes all the excitement out of it."



She rolled her eyes, hiding a smirk.



Honestly, who in their right mind tried to make cooking a thrill ride?
###Chapter 49 We're Friends Now

Once the glazed ribs were done, Alexia whipped up a pot of porridge to round out the meal.



Hunger seemed to wake something in Waylon. Even at the table, the habits drilled into him since childhood surfaced-his every bite neat, every gesture graceful.


Resting her chin on her palm, Alexia took a quiet moment to simply observe him.


Some people really did get all the perks. Even watching him eat was strangely captivating.



Waylon didn't miss her gaze. He took his time with the next bite, letting a smile play at his lips. "You keep looking over here."



Quickly, Alexia looked away, her tone as breezy as she could manage. "What's wrong with appreciating a nice view? You're easy on the eyes-it's just normal for anyone to stare. I doubt you'll be scarred for life by a little extra attention."



A glimmer of amusement sparked in Waylon's eyes "Is that so? Does everyone with a pretty face get this much of your focus?"

Alexia's posture stiffened as she answered, "It's just how people are wired. Who doesn't appreciate something-or someone-good-looking?"



Waylon's mouth quirked in a smile she couldn't quite read. "Interesting. So, say, Andre-would you say he's good-looking too?"



That caught Alexia off guard, but she took the question seriously and gave an honest nod. "Sure.He's basically a ceebrity in the racing world."



Waylon's tone stayed smooth, but a subtle tension crept in. "So is that how you two hit it off?"



Alexia shrugged, honest again. "Not the only reason,but it probably didn't hurt."


A spoonful of porridge later, Waylon spoke in an offhand way, though something else lingered in his words. "Guys like Andre have it made. They flash a smile and everyone melts, doors just open up. Me,though? Guess I don't have that kind of luck."



For a second, Alexia froze, caught off guard by his words.Something about his tone unsettled her, setting her pulse racing. Her response came quickly, almost on instinct. "It's not really like that. Andre and I just crossed paths and wound up helping each other out.Things unfolded on their own. Besides, we're friends now,aren't we?"
A faint, skeptical arch of Waylon's brow followed as he regarded her."Is that right? Weren't you the one who declared, 'Out of everyone in this world, there's no one I despise more than Waylon Mason'? Is that how you still feel?"


Heat crept up Alexia's neck, embarrassment rising "Seriously, bringing up old arguments just ruins the mood. I only said those things because I was angry back then. Let it go, will you?"



A soft laugh escaped Waylon as he met her eyes, the look in his gaze dark and impossible to read-like midnight with secrets swirling beneath. "Unfortunately for me, that's not something I can let go. And I don't want to be your friend."



That admission made her heart stumble again. "What's stopping you?"



Waylon finished his meal, set the spoon down with quiet finality, and got to his feet. His face gave nothing away. "No special reason. Thanks for dinner.You should head home."



She sat watching as he walked away, a knot of frustration twisting in her chest.


Truthfully, Waylon's reluctance to play at friendship shouldn't have come as a shock.

Too much history lingered between them-arguments,missteps, wounds that still ached. Seven years had done nothing to erase any of it, despite all the efforts to pretend otherwise. Starting over, as if none of it had ever happened, was only a comforting lie.



No matter how hard Alexia tried to reach him, Waylon always slipped just out of reach. He never let her get too close-one moment radiating warmth, the next retreating behind cool indifference.



Back in his teenage days, Waylon was impossible to miss. Arrogant, sharp with words, always at the center of attention. But at least he owned his flaws and brilliance alike-he never pretended to be someone else, even if it stirred jealousy.



These days, he hid his sharper edges beneath a veneer of smooth confidence. To the world, he was the picture of poise, a charmer who made everything seem effortless. Underneath, though, she sensed the threat that still lingered-like velvet hiding a blade.



She didn't like this version of him.



Time slipped by as Alexia lingered in the living room Just as she decided it was time to go,her gaze fell on the unused cooling patch tucked away in her bag.


Impulse took over. She snatched it up and headed upstairs.

A push on the bedroom door revealed Waylon on the balcony, standing in the wind, face turned into the icy night.


Alexia set the patch down and marched toward him."You know it's freezing, right? Stand out here any longer, and you'll be even sicker than you already are."


Waylon didn't move, voice steady, a stubborn note threading through it. "Just a minute. The cold's good for clearing my head."



"You're burning with fever-of course you're spouting nonsense. The more you freeze out here, the worse you'll get."



Alexia moved to tug him back inside, but Waylon's hand shot out, catching her wrist. She glanced up,finding a hint of mischief flickering at the edges of his mouth.



Waylon looked downright pleased by her annoyance."You don't hold back, do you?"



Annoyance twitched in her jaw. She twisted his wrist with practiced ease and yanked him toward the bedroom. "Inside. Now."



He offered no resistance, allowing himself to be hauled back in, and she tossed him onto the bed.
Without a pause, Alexia ripped open the cooling patch,pressed it onto his forehead with a sharp smack, and stepped back with satisfaction. "There. Maybe now you'll think straight."



Waylon lay stunned, the chill spreading across his skin as he stared at her, momentarily robbed of words.
###Chapter 50 Are You Making Fun Of Me Again
The look of stunned confusion on Waylon's face made Alexia break into laughter, all her earlier frustration melting away. "I'll let you off easy since you're sick," she said, teasing him lightly.



Before he could offer a reply, she tucked the blanket around him, spun on her heel, and exited the room,closing the door behind her with a soft click.



Waylon remained motionless for a few moments,his fingers drifting absently over the cooling patch on his forehead while a quiet sigh slipped out.


Illness truly had a way of making a person reckless.Odd how a fever could loosen the tongue or spark foolish bravery.



The medicine worked quickly, and the exhaustion washed over him in heavy waves, sweeping him toward sleep before he could resist.


A pang of regret tugged at him just before he slipped under.



Maybe letting her come here had been a mistake.Maybe inviting Alexia back into his life was a door that should have stayed closed



Seven years had passed, but she was unchanged-straightforward, bold, never afraid to show exactly what she felt.



He, on the other hand, was tangled up in knots he couldn't begin to unravel.



The afternoon passed by unnoticed. Waylon slept until darkness filled the house.


By the time he finally woke, the fever had broken and his thoughts had cleared.



Waylon peeled the patch off his forehead,headed downstairs, and discovered Alexia still there.



Curled on the sofa, she hugged a pillow, fast asleep and peaceful.



Waylon crossed the room quietly, stopping at her side.Moonlight spilled through the window, draping her shoulders in soft silver, as if a gentle veil had settled around her.



No effort was made to wake her. He simply stood there, holding himself in that careful space-close enough to watch over her, but not quite close enough to reach out.



Eventually, Alexia stirred awake. She yawned, rubbing at the sleep gathered in her eyes before murmuring "You're awake, huh? Hold on, let me check your temperature."



She fumbled for the thermometer gun, still blinking away the last traces of sleep, and aimed it at his forehead.



After the beep, she breathed a sigh of relief. "Finally,your fever's gone."



Only a breath separated them now. Waylon caught the subtle, comforting scent that lingered in her hair.


His gaze grew gentle, drawn to the way relief softened her features.



Waylon dipped his head, edging a little nearer.The warmth of his breath swept across her cheek, and she went rigid. Her eyes rounded in surprise. "What's going on?"



Waylon kept his silence. His steady, searching eyes never wavered.



It made perfect sense to him that she had chosen to stay.



Responsibility and kindness came naturally to her. No matter who needed her, she would always step in to help,especially if illness was involved. That sense of fairness, her ability to extend the same warmth to anyone, sometimes made his chest ache.



He resented that generosity. It never belonged to him alone.



For a heartbeat, his face shadowed with frustration,but the mood vanished as quickly as it came. "About that favor you mentioned... is it still on the table?"


Without pausing, Alexia answered, "Yes. I meant it.Just tell me what you need."



For a brief moment, he pressed his lips together before saying,"Seven days of glazed ribs."



She faltered, blinking in confusion. "Come again?"



He didn't hesitate as he explained, "Make glazed ribs for me for an entire week."



With narrowed eyes, Alexia looked at him,suspicion plain in her voice. "You really like them that much?Are you sure you won't get tired of eating the same thing?"



"Never. And you have to join me at the table, every day."


While waiting for her answer, he watched her face for any hint of refusal.
She matched his gaze. "Waylon, I have to point something out... You just landed back in town, and suddenly you need company for meals? That's new for you."


The corners of his mouth turned up with a sly smile "Why not? Is there some unwritten rule about that?"



"Not quite. But I don't eat with just anyone. If youstill insist we're not friends, then I guess glazed ribs are off the menu. Admit we're friends first. Otherwise, no deal." Clearly, she was still holding on to his earlier claim about not wanting her friendship.



With arms folded tightly across his chest,he offered only a small shake of his head. "Are there strings attached to paying back a favor now?"



Pinkness bloomed on Alexia's cheeks, leaving her looking uncertain.



"Alexia, I'm not the type to haggle."


Disappointment flickered through her, but pressing her case would only be a waste of breath.


People learned quickly that Waylon never bent once he'd drawn his line in the sand. Compromise simply was not in his nature.


 
"Alright," Alexia muttered, waving him off as she pivoted away. Yet she barely managed a step before his grip found her hand, and he pulled her back to the couch without a word.



She landed awkwardly, feeling the pressure of his knee between hers and his arm resting solidly behind her.She was going nowhere. He held all the cards.



Deliberate and slow, Waylon let his gaze drift over her features, pausing when his eyes settled on her lips.



Even with him so close, Alexia refused to let herself rattle. After the first flash of surprise,she gathered herself and met his stare with cool resolve. "Are you making fun of me again?"
###Chapter 51 Walk Away With Nothing


Alexia still remnembered Waylon's last prank-it had left her utterly embarrassed and fuming.

Waylon's lips curved into a faint smirk as he leaned in, gently tucking a loose strand of her hair behind her ear. His warm fingers grazed her cheek, slid past her ear, and slowly traveled downward,leaving Alexia flustered and completely thrown off.

Her cheeks turned visibly pink, and it wasn't long before she looked like she was about to blow.

Just then, he pulled back, that teasing energy disappearing as he gave her an innocent look. "Your hair was out of place."

She smacked his shoulder, her face burning with embarrassment. "This is all your fault!" she huffed,awkwardly squirming out from under him. "You're seriously such a pain now, Waylon!"

But despite her scolding, Waylon looked completely unbothered.

As Alexia walked off, he leaned casually against the doorframe, a teasing look in his eyes."Don't let the door hit you on the way out," he said, not even bothering to walk her out.

Fuming, she marched away, her thoughts made up.

This guy was awful and definitely not someone worth getting close to.

The following day, right outside the courthouse, Alexia sat quietly on a bench in her bold red coat, catching more than a few glances from people passing by.

It was human nature-when someone looked that stunning, people couldn't help but look twice.

Her mind wandered back to her wedding with Roger.

That day had been heavy with tension. Roger hadn't even wanted the wedding. She hadn't really understood what it meant to be married or even how she truly felt. Her so-called mother's words had nudged her along, and she had gone with it, thinking it was the right thing to do.

All she'd wanted was her family's approval, to feel loved. She thought marrying Roger would check all the boxes.
But she now realized that what she truly needed was something marriage could never give her.

While she was still lost in thought, Roger's chilly voice snapped her back. "Here already, Alexia? In such a rush to get rid of me?"

Alexia looked up and saw him standing a few steps away, perfectly dressed, as aways.

She didn't even have the energy to argue and replied coldly, "Since you've already figured everything out,let's just get the paperwork done. That way, we won't have to cross paths again."

Roger's expression turned darker at her sharp response.

The woman in front of him-bold, stunning, completely unbothered-was nothing like the quiet, obedient girl he once had at home.

She had become someone fierce, magnetic, and dangerously beautiful.

And when a woman held that kind of powerful charm, it was the kind of attraction men couldn't help but chase.

Even though Roger had always looked down on her for being money-minded, he couldn't deny that if Alexia had shown him this real, unfiltered version of herself from the beginning, maybe things wouldn't have ended in divorce.

As far as he was concerned, if it couldn't be Sirius, it didn't really matter who he married. Marilee just happened to be the most convenient option.

For him, marriage was nothing more than a matter of picking the better one.

Without much emotion, Roger pulled out a document from his briefcase and handed it to her. "Just sign this,and we won't have to cross paths ever again."

Alexia took the document, gave it a quick glance, then tossed it straight back at his face without hesitation."You're unbelievable, Roger! Absolutely shameless!" she snapped.

The document slapped against,his face with a loud smack, drawing curious stares from people nearby.

The so-called agreement he handed her was basically asking her to walk away with nothing.

Alexia let out a cold laugh. "You're the one who cheated, and now you're hiding behind a prenup to twist things your way? The original division of property was already unfair and now you want me to leave empty handed? What's that supposed to mean?"

Roger didn't even flinch. He picked the document up and said in a low, sarcastic tone, "So you do care.1thought you were above all this by now. You've got Waylon backing you, right? Your future's looking golden.Why stress over some leftover cash? Just sign, and you're free to run into your bright new tomorrow."

Alexia's brows knit together. "I don't care how bright my future might be-it doesn't excuse your betrayal.And you think I'll walk away empty-handed lie it's nothing? Roger, is this really all you've got? Throwing this agreement in my face just to humiliate me?"

Even if Roger had barely been present and their relationship had faded long ago, Alexia had still given her all to the Gibson family over the past two years.

Even Gloria, her difficult mother-in-law, had enjoyed her meticulous care for two years.

And now, expecting her to walk away with nothing? It was like spitting on every sacrifice she had made.
###Chapter 52 Three Slaps


Roger scoffed with a smug grin. "Back then, I had the woman Waylon treasures now wrapped around my finger. You may look all high and mighty today, but don't forget-once upon a time, you did whatever | told you.No hesitation. No defiance."

Alexia didn't reply immediately. A faint, bitter smile tugged at her lips, one that held no warmth. Whether it was aimed at herself or him, even she wasn't sure.

Then,without a single word of warning, she took a step forward and slapped him hard.

The crisp sound of the slap echoed across the hall. Roger's head turned with the blow, and for a moment,he looked stunned, as if trying to process what had just happened.

"That was for the girl I used to be," Alexia said in a steady, icy voice."The foolish one who thought the boy was her hero just because he once stood up for her."

She hadn't forgotten. When Roger first came back to the Gibson family, there was a timne he'd stepped in to protect her, taking on a group of guy's and walking away bruised and bloodied. That moment,along with Eleanor's warmth and wise, grandmotherly advice, had left a deep mark on her heart.

Even as Roger grew colder and more distant afterward, she held on to that early memory, convinced that deep down, he was someone worth holding on to. Again and again, she tried to reach him, doing everything she could to keep him from feeling alone or pushed aside.

Roger was still reeling when the second slap hit-this one even harder, more cutting.

"And that one is for the woman who endured your so-called marriage. You were never a real husband, never tried to hold our home together. You gave me zero respect. If Marilee was your everything, then why didn't you fight for her? Instead, you married me, betrayed me, and acted like the poor, heartbroken man. Who were you trying to fool-me or yourself?"

Every word she spoke chipped away at the fake dignity Roger tried so hard to maintain, leaving his hypocrisy out in the open.

As expected, his face twisted with anger. His jaw tightened, and his hands curled into fists, itching to slap back. But Alexia didn't give him the chance. Before he could even react, her third slap came down-sharp,
fast, and merciless.

"That last one is for the woman I am now-for finally seeing you for what you really are and acting like you deserve. You talk about me leaving with nothing? Roger, you're the real loser here-just a coward trying to play the victim."

Those three slaps weren't just physical, they shredded his pride, each one a clean cut straight to his ego.

By now, a small crowd had gathered. Courthouse drama wasn't unusual, but watching a woman deliver three brutal slaps to her ex with this much fire? That was a spectacle nobody wanted to miss.

Roger's pride lay in ruins, crushed beneath her heel for the world to witness.

His breath came in short, angry bursts before he finally choked out, "How dare you?" His fists trembled with rage.

Alexia lightly flexed her wrist, easing the sting in her hand, but her expression stayed cold and firm. "There's nothing I won't do. We're getting divorced and more than that, you're going to give back everything you took that was never rightfully yours. You and your family have enjoyed stolen wealth and borrowed glory for far too long. It's time someone pulled the curtain back."

Roger's face contorted with fury. "You think you can just make that call? Who the hell do you think you are,throwing threats at me? Are you planning to drag Waylon into this? Have him target the Gibson family for your little revenge game?"

"Please!" Alexia gave him a slow once-over, her lips curling into a cool, predatory smirk."You think you deserve his attention?"

Roger winced, clearly shaken. Her words had struck deeper than any slap could have.

As Alexia turned to leave, her face grew even colder."Wait for the court papers," she said without looking back.

Outside the courthouse, Alexia pulled out her phone. Calmly, she logged into an anonymous forum and typed out a post.

Without missing a beat, she made a call.

Inside a glossy high-rise nestled in the city's financial core, the sharp ring of a phone cut through the office's ambient calm.
A woman with rich, flowing waves of hair glanced at her phone. Her face lit up instantly as she answered.

"Well,well,Alexia. What do I owe the honor today?" she asked in a playful tone.

Alexia's lips curled into a faint smile. "Any chance your royal schedule has room for one more case?"

The woman's eyes sparkled, and her tone was soaked in fake humility."Oh, please. People are practically camping out just for the chance to have me take their case. My schedule? Good luck squeezing in."

Across the room, a young intern glanced up, curiosity flickering across her face as she overheard the exchange.

It wasn't every day the office's untouchable legal queen dropped her usual steel demeanor and acted this playful. That voice was way too soft for her usual courtroom bite.

Was that a charming guy on the other end of the call?

Unbothered,Alexia replied coolly,that so? Guess I'll have to look elsewhere then."

"Whoa, whoa, don't hang up!" the woman blurted, dropping the tease. "You know I'm messing with you.You calling me? I'm honored. So? Let me guess-divorce?"
###Chapter 53 Luna Takes Action


Alexia let out a weary breath. "You summed it up perfectly."

"Roger's antics during the marriage made this outcome obvious." With a knowing smile, the woman brushed her hair from her shoulder. "I'll handle the case. Let's arrange a meeting to go over the specifics."

Once the call ended, she spun her golden ring around her thumb, then glanced at her assistant. "Get the car ready.I'm feeling generous today-let's head out early and celebrate."

As midnight crept in, a secretive financial forum lit up with a sudden surge of excitement after a single message appeared.

The elusive Luna-once the most talked-about strategist in the business-broke her two-year silence,posting snapshots of her winning portfoliosfrom both domestic and global markets

Within just ten minutes, the thread exploded with thousands of responses.

"First reply! Wait, is this real? Luna's actually back!"

"Luna disappeared for two years, but her returns speak for themselves. Those tech stocks she scooped up back then turned tiny startups into market giants. No one else is pulling off profits like Luna."

"She's on another level! And did anyone notice? She's moved out of her old-school investments and poured a ton into biotech recently."

"She's dumped Lady Cat from Jenkins Group, and she's cut Black Dawn Tech from Gibson Group too.Dropping Lady Cat isn't much of a shock-I always thought it was a stretch for Luna to invest in that brand in the first place. But cutting ties with Black Dawn Tech? That's a surprise. Gibson Group was calling it teir flagship innovation, and their share price keeps climbing. Why doesn't Luna see what everyone else does?"

"Does this mean there's trouble brewing at these companies? Is anyone here sitting on inside info? Spill it if you've got it."

Eyes glued to the screen, Zayne felt his blood pressure rising with every new post. He smashed out a reply,fingers flying.

"Lady Cat is killing it in the market, and with Marilee's endorsement, sales are through the roof! Don't you people keep up with trends? Marilee is everywhere right now. Enough with the scare tactics-or you'll be hearing from our lawyers."

"Well, someone's pressed! Let's see how things shake out when trading opens. My money's on Luna's picks. No matter how big Marilee gets, she can't outshine Luna's track record. Take your celebrity worship somewhere else-this forum's for real investors."

Getting called a fanboy online lit Zayne up with outrage

What stung even more than the taunts was the proof, plain as day, that Luna had turned her back on Jenkins Group.

Message after desperate message went unanswered, each one disappearing into the void.

Meanwhile, Roger sat in front of his own computer, troubled by the same news.

Rage surged through him as he scrolled through the forum. "What are they trying to pull?"

The company's future hinged on Black Dawn Tech,a venture that had shown nothing but profit from the start, thanks to its groundbreaking vision.

It stood out as one of Roger's rare accomplishments that even his grandfather had publicly praised.

Having the project's worth questioned out in the open left him seething.

"Black Dawn Tech's growth speaks for itself. Luna's opinion changes nothing. This company's headed for the top, with or without her blessing!"

That declaration sparked a fresh wave of debate on the forum.

"I'm with you. Black Dawn Tech looks like a powerhouse in the making. Maybe Luna missed the mark this time."

"She's never steered us wrong. She posts her portfolio for those who know how to read the signs.I'm following her advice, as always."

Roger scoffed at the blind loyalty and retorted, "Never made a mistake, huh? Then Black Dawn Tech will be her first. Let's see who's right when the dust settles."

While Roger was still riding the high of defending his point, a user with a night-sky avatar dropped a response beneath his comment.
It contained only one word.

"Really?"

A single, snide word carried the weight of pure mockery.

Once the forum recognized the user with the constellation-themed icon, chaos erupted on the thread.

"No way, it's Moon! Luna's post was enough to drag Moon out of hiding!"

Everyone in the financial world knew the difference between these two giants. Luna-the market's mysterious strategist-could move stocks with a whisper, while Moon was a mastermind when it came to managing risk. As Luna's legend grew, so did Moon's, each victory fueling the rivalry.

Their head-to-head battles had become the stuff of market legend.

Rumor had it, Luna had dismissed Moon in private as an unworkable oddball, while Moon, on his end, once called Luna the single most confounding opponent he'd ever faced.
###Chapter 54 Rivals Face Off


Moon's appearance in the forum thread sent the entire comment section into an uproar.

Curiosity ran wild, and someone finally asked outright,"Moon, how do you really feel about Black Dawn Tech? Is it a long-term play or a sinking ship?"

His answer came fast and without hesitation. "A sinking ship."

Agreement between Moon and Luna was practically unheard of. Renowned for their legendary rivalry and constant sparring in financial circles, these two rarely landed on the same side of a bet. Yet here they were-both seeing nothing good in Black Dawn Tech's prospects.

Speculation spread at lightning speed after that. Two giants raising red flags? Clearly, something big must be brewing behind closed doors.

Meanwhile,Roger's glare bored holes into his monitor, his mood growing darker with every new comment.

What the hell was going on? One after another, these titans kept lining up against him. Did they truly think Black Dawn Tech was so weak, or was it just personal contempt?

Worse than the negativity itself was the sheer weight Luna and Moon carried. Their opinions had the power to move mountains-or topple them. With their influence and hordes of followers, the market's faith could crumble overnight, sending Black Dawn Tech's shares into free fall the next morning.

Meanwhile, Alexia logged into her account. The thread had already exploded, comments racing past ten thousand.

She scrolled the replies, stopping as soon as Moon's name appeared.

A sly grin crept across her face. "I even managed to drag him out of hiding."

Moon's reputation preceded him. One of the few players who could keep pace with her, no matter how wild the game got. Luna-her alter ego-loved stirring chaos in the markets, while Moon fashioned himself as a self-styled guardian of order, always swooping in to rein in loose cannons.

Eyes narrowing at his message, Alexia murmured, "Not bad at all."
In a world ruled by profit and power, Moon stood alone as the only rival she ever truly admired. Their clashes in the financial arena stretched back years, each one more intense than the last.

Black Dawn Tech's polished image never fooled her. Outsiders might fall for the buzz, but all she saw was a hollow facade. Just anotheroncept stock" whipped into a frenzy-an empty promise on the verge of collapse.

When she shared her latest portfolio, it was little more than a courtesy. The real onslaught had only just begun.

Alexia scrolled through the avalanche of opinions, letting the chatter wash over her, until a flood of messages from Zayne broke through her focus.

She didn't waste a second. Without opening a single one, she blocked him outright.

Barely a heartbeat passed before another chat popped up-this time, Moon's name flashed across the screen.

"Are you shorting Black Dawn Tech?"

A spark of excitement danced in Alexia's eyes as she typed her reply."That company's nothing but hot air.Leaving money on the table would be the real crime. What's the plan, Moon? You here to play sheriff again?"

"No interest in policing you."

A quiet laugh escaped her. "Oh? And what if Black Dawn Tech tries to hire you to go after me?"

"They wouldn't have the budget."

A sly grin played at the corners of Alexia's mouth. "Funny coming from you. Didn't you once leap to the rescue of a handful of mediocre firms? Seemed like you just wanted to mess with me."

"That was personal. I just couldn't stand you."

A laugh nearly slipped from Alexia, but before she could type out a comeback, a fresh notification interrupted her.

"But Black Dawn Tech? That company annoys me even more."

Almost immediately, a file attachment landed in her chat. Alexia clicked it open and her whole demeanor sharpened. The file was packed with privileged data-a deep dive into Black Dawn Tech's shadowy dealings, the sort of analysis reserved for executives.

What truly rattled her wasn't the dirt inside-it was how perfectly it matched her own secret findings, point for point.

Clearly,Moon's reach matched her own.

Alexia let her gaze linger on his username, the spark of a challenge in her eyes."So,you've been busy."

Waylon snapped his laptop shut and turned to Simon. "Everything on track for tomorrow's opening bell?"

"All preparations made, just as you requested," Simon responded with a crisp nod.

Waylon's fingers drummed an unhurried rhythm on the tabletop. "Excellent. Time to surf Luna's wave."

A trace of a smirk pulled at his lips when he thought of Gibson Group. That one was ripe for the fall.

The following morning, chaos erupted the moment markets opened. Black Dawn Tech's shares collapsed-panic selling everywhere. The company's staggering losses set off alarm bells. Enraged, Allen rang Roger and tore into him with a furious barrage.

After weathering the onslaught, Roger pressed his hands to his forehead, fatigue hitting him like a tidal wave.


A sinking dread gnawed at his insides. Every instinct screamed that this plummet was just the first sign of much bigger trouble looming.

Alexia followed her daily routine-she glanced over the markets, then drove over to Afoross University for the day's work.

She hadn't even turned off the engine when her phone started to buzz. Ada's name lit up her screen."Alexia, have you seen what's trending? Marilee's back at it!"

Annoyance creased Alexia's brow as she unlocked her phone and scrolled to her social feed.

The latest trending topic was impossible to miss-#StolenLifeForTwentyYears was climbing fast.

Curiosity piqued, she tapped on the hashtag. The first video to appear was Marilee, eyes glistening as she delivered a heart-wrenching interview for"Power Playersa high-profile feature. Through tears and shaky breaths, Marilee painted herself as the victim-a privileged life stolen by an imposter from the slums, lost for two whole decades. Her fragile act pulled the online crowd to her side, a tidal wave of sympathy flooding every comment section.
###Chapter 55 Orchestrated Online Hate
In the video, Marilee played the ideal victim, who had lost everything and was now bravely trying to get her life back.

As the interview wrapped up, the reporter delivered the question everyone had been waiting for."Do you hate her?"

Marilee looked straight into the camera, paused for a long time, then wiped her tears and quietly said, rather not answer."

And just like that, the internet lit up like wildfire.

"Marilee is way too soft. If someone stole my life for twenty years, I'd be out for revenge!"

"That other woman is disgusting. If Marilee hadn't stood up, that fake would still be enjoying the rich life that wasn't hers!"

"Does anyone know where Alexia's really from? I heard she was raised in the slums-no surprise there.Places like that only turn out garbage. She's just a rat that clawed her way out of the gutter."

"She's a teacher at Afoross now? You've got to be kidding. A school like that hiring her? We should start a protest!"

Marilee's fan club didn't waste time. They launched a campaign with the hashtag #ProtectTheRealPrincess,filling social media with hate aimed at Alexia.

Things only got worse. Gossip pages, bloggers, and online news kept spreading the story in different ways.But the main idea stayed-everyone felt sorry for Marilee and wondered why Alexia was even in the picture.

Ada sounded worried on the phone. "Alexia, my brother's trying to shut this story down right now. Marilee set this up for sure-she probably has fake accounts making it go viral."

Alexia stayed calm. "If we shut it down now, she'll just say rich people are trying to hide the truth. This going viral means she has more planned. I'll wait and gather proof. Let her make the next move."

Ada exhaled sharply. "I'm seriously worried. Her fans are ruthless. Have you seen the stuff they're saying?Some of those comments have gone viral. I couldn't even finish reading them."
Alexia spoke without hesitation. "Calm down. Bad press still puts me on the radar. If she wants to give me free publicity, I'd be a fool not to take it. You should focus on your job and try looking at things that won't make your blood boil."

Ada let out a frustrated sigh, but deep down, she was a little amazed at how unbothered Alexia seemed.

Sliding her phone back into her coat pocket, Alexia turned and walked toward the classrooms, only to bump into Brandon, who was sweaty and carrying a basketball.

"Seriously? You're actually showing up here?" Brandon gave her a once-over, smirking. "If I were you, l'd be hiding under my bed."

Brandon was the type who loved watching drama from the sidelines. With the scandals blowing up online,seeing Alexia get roasted was pure entertainment to him. He couldn't stop liking every hateful comment.

Alexia didn't even blink. "And what's any of this got to do with you? You barely got into this university on an athletic scholarship, almost failed out because of your grades, and let's not even talk about the gambling debt that nearly got you expelled. And you think I should be embarrassed? If it weren't for your grandfather crawling to the board and begging them to give you another chance, you'd have been long gone."

Brandon's face turned red, and he retorted, "You act all high and mighty, but don't forget that you were the fake the Jenkins family kicked out. Even my brother didn't want you. If I wasn't feeling nice, I'd have called campus security to drag you off already."

Alexia stepped forward, looking down at him with calm authority. "Be my guest. Let's see who security sides with-a student on probation or a faculty member?"

Brandon stared at her, then snorted. "You? A faculty member? What do you do-serve food in the cafeteria?Hand out trays?"

Before she could reply, a calm male voice came from behind. "Ms. Jenkins, there you are."

Brandon's shoulders tensed. He turned and went completely still.

A tall guy in a black hoodie walked toward them, backlit by the sun. His presence practically demanded attention.
"Nolan Hayes?" Brandon was shocked. The campus genius-brilliant, reclusive, and nearly mythical.Most students only heard his name, not saw him. And now here he was, heading their way.

And he was actually talking to Alexia with respect.

Wait, was she really a teacher here? No way! That couldn't be right.

Brandon just stood there, stunned, as Nolan walked right past him and stood next to Alexia.

Even Alexia looked a bit caughtoff guard."Oh, it's you? Didn't expect to run into you here."

Nolan gave a subtle smile. "Not quite a coincidence. I came to find you."
###Chapter 56 Shouldn't The Weak Be Phased Out
Alexia raised an eyebrow. "Wait, you came to find me? Don't tell me you actually enrolled in my class?"

Nolan nodded without a second thought. "Wouldn't miss it for anything."

She chuckled. "It's really not that exciting. Just a basic course to help students get their credits."

"Doesn't matter," he said with a small smile. "Still wanted to be here."

Brandon stood nearby, silently fuming as they talked like he wasn't even present. "Nolan, have you completely lost it?" he asked, sounding annoyed and confused.

Nolan didn't even look at him properly. "If you're confused, start by asking yourself why you think it's okay to mouth off to a faculty member. You think that's going to end well for you?"

Then, turning back to Alexia, he added, "Ignore him. He's all muscle, no mind."

Brandon's face turned red with shame. He couldn't stand smart guys like Nolan, who always made him feel small.

"Shut your mouth, jerk!" he snapped, throwing his basketball aside and charging at Nolan. But Nolan moved like lightning. His eyes sharpened, and in one quick motion, he swept his leg behind Brandon's knee.

With a loud thud, Brandon hit the floor. The noise was enough to turn heads-students nearby stopped to see what had just happened.

Nolan didn't bat an eye, even with all the stares on him. "If that hurt your pride, file a complaint. Or go cry to your grandfather again-those seem to be your two go-to moves. Honestly, you act like a spoiled kid who never grew up."

He said it so calmly, but every word hit Brandon's pride like aknife.

A wave of whispers and stifled laughs spread through the students watching. Brandon, humiliated,scrambled up and growled, "You'll regret this!" before darting off like he couldn't get away fast enough.

Alexia raised an eyebrow, slightly amused. "Huh. Didn't know he could run that fast."

Nolan shrugged like it was nothing. "Huh, that was light punishment for someone who can't grasp common respect. Come on, I'Il walk you to your lecture."

Alexia nodded and walked alongside him.

When they arrived at the lecture room, students were already starting to take their seats.

It was her first time teaching this class, and Alexia made sure to be fully ready.

As expected, whispers followed her into the lecture room. The scandal about the "fake daughter" was clearly the hot topic. She even noticed a few students trying to secretly take pictures of her.

But Alexia stayed unfazed.

As soon as the lecture started, the room calmed down. Alexia took control with ease, skipping the usual boring style in favor of simple, relatable teaching that made tough topics easier to grasp.

The students gradually stopped zoning out. Their blank stares turned into interest as her lesson drew them in.

Midway through class, Alexia brought up some exciting new developments in gene editing and how they were now being used in cancer treatment.

A student quickly raised his hand. Alexia looked over and saw a young man with glasses, tidy clothes, and a respectful demeanor. "Yes?" she prompted.

He spoke in a calm, thoughtful tone. "Since gene editing has shown such strong results in clinical trials, it seems like the field has a bright future. So with that in mind, do you think ethical restrictions might loosen up? More specifically, should editing human embryos to remove inherited diseases be allowed at some point?"

His question stirred instant whispers across the room. Even Nolan leaned forward slightly, clearly curious to hear Alexia's answer.

Alexia calmly shut her textbook. "It really depends on the situation. If we start loosening ethical limits around gene editing in human embryos, we open the door to things like 'designer babies.' And let's not forget-cutting-edge technology always comes at a cost. If parents could design their children's looks, IQ,or talents... who's really getting access to that? The wealthy. And what kind of world does that build?"

The student paused, thinking it over. "It'd probably make social inequality worse and maybe reduce diversity too."
Alexia gave a faint smile. "Exactly. Tech pushes us forward, but it's not all upside. People are complex,and because of that, there's always going to be conflict. And that tension? It's what keeps innovation alive."

She paused for a beat, her voice tightening. "But if the wealthy start perfecting their children from birth through gene editing, that tension will vanish fast and not in a good way. Ethics exist to protect those who don't have power. Without those boundaries, we're not evolving-we're wiping out options for millions."

The student let out a slow sigh. "But doesn't that slow down science? And honestly, why keep protecting the weak? Isn't survival of the fittest how nature works? Shouldn't the weak just be phased out?"

His words hit like a brick. The room, buzzing just moments ago, went completely still. Everyone turned to look at him, their faces full of shock and disbelief.
###Chapter 57 Alexia's Wisdom


The stunned silence didn't last long. Within seconds, the room burst into loud protests.

"He's completely lost it!"

"Liam Whitmore, did all that studying melt your brain? What happened to basic decency?"

"What good is science if it doesn't serve everyone? Is it just some toy for the elite?"

The uproar swelled until Alexia tapped the lectern. Her voice didn't rise; it was calm and firm. "That's enough."

She'd met people like Liam before-brilliant minds, always two steps ahead in thought, yet blind to the emotions and realities of others. Cold brilliance, she called it. Dangerous when left unchecked.

Still, she didn't see him as a lost cause. He was gifted, no doubt about that. But talent without empathy?That kind of brilliance burned itself out, fast and ugly.

She looked at him and said calmly,"Liam,tell me something-how do you define the weak?"

"Poverty. Ignorance. Arrogance," he said flatly.

Alexia nodded. "Fair enough. But what makes you so sure you're not one of them?"

His jaw tightened, but the words didn't come right away."1"mnot," he said after a pause. "Not compared to them."

"Maybe not," Alexia said, her voice even. "Getting into Afoross University means you've already outpaced most people. But there's always someone smarter, better. Let's say we put you in a room full of the smartest people alive. Where do you think you'd rank then?"

Liam's confidence flickered. He didn't answer. Alexia leaned on the lectern, eyes sweeping across the classroom."Everything's relative-wealth, power, status, even intelligence. Your position can change the moment your surroundings change. One day you're at the top, the next you're not even on the map."

Then her voice deepened, each word landing with clarity. "Ethics aren't a roadblock to progress. They're what keep progress from becoming destruction. Without boundaries, science can strip away dignity,ruin the environment, and tear apart society. Innovation without understanding leads nowhere. We don't just push science forward. We have to think about what it leaves behind."

Silence returned, but this time, it held weight.

Nolan was the first to applaud. A second later, the other students snapped out of their daze as a wave of thunderous clapping followed.

By the end of class, Alexia had completely won them over.

Students swarmed her, eager to talk, ask questions, and simply be near someone who made science feel like more than facts and formulas.

"Ms. Jenkins is the full package-smart, stunning, and real."

"Best class I've taken. She actually mnakes science make sense. Finally! God, we've had our fill of those dull,lifeless lectures. She's the best thing to happen to this department."

"Those trolls are clueless. 'Fake daughter'? Please. She's thoughtful, sharp, and kind. Unlike Marilee,who just rides her fame and manipulates the narrative whenever it suits her."

"Come on, Marilee is basically a walking PR campaign. With all that money backing her, she sells the 'perfect girl next door' image like she's clocking in for work. I can't stand the fake act."

Nolan listened as the praise flew around him, eyes resting on Alexia still surrounded by students. Only then did he let out a quiet breath.

Around lunch, he approached and invited her to join him and Damon. She smiled, but gently turned him down.

He tilted his.head as she gathered her things. "Got plans?" he asked.

She gave a small nod while closing her notebook. "Yeah. My lunches are booked all week."

"Busy social life," he said, narrowing his eyes playfully."Friend?"

"Not quite." She hesitated, trying to explain the strange mess her connection with Waylon had become."More like a headache."

He blinked, then laughed."A headache?"
Alexia gave a small shrug. "Yeah. He's arrogant. One minute he keeps his distance; the next he's suddenly there, dragging you into something. He's exhausting."

"Do you hate him?" Nolan asked, like it was a casual thought.

Her hand froze halfway through zipping her bag.

He caught her pause and smiled knowingly. "Didn't think so. Doesn't sound like hate."

She raised an eyebrow. "You think you know me that well?"

"Educated guess. And since you're all booked up this week, I'm claiming your time for Prof. Ellis next week."Nolan gave her a playful wave and wandered off, content with her nod.

After leaving campus, Alexia pulled out her phone and scrolled through the flood of online chatter. Her name was everywhere.

She smiled, just a little. And she wasn't about to let free publicity go to waste.

In a few minutes, she had official, verified accounts across all major platforms. Her first post went up without hesitation.

"Two-faced? Gold digger? Scheming bitch? I've heard worse. Twenty years playing the perfect understudy -no one does 'fake daughter' better than me. Curious about my side? Catch my live stream tonight at 8.Don't miss it."
###Chapter 58 She's Clearly Trying To Destroy You


Since Marilee wanted to stir up a media war, Alexia figured she might as well join the game.

After her post, it didn't take long for the internet to explode with reactions. Within minutes,her follower count exploded.

Marilee's supporters were quick to attack, flooding Alexia's inbox with hateful messages. Onlookers were stunned that Alexia, branded as the 'fake daughter,' still had the guts to announce a live stream despite the backlash. But once people actually watched what she posted, they were drawn in. It was surprisingly entertaining, enough to make them hit that follow button.

It was clear that tonight's live stream was going to be wild.

While thousands were setting reminders for the broadcast, Alexia pulled up outside Waylon's company building.

Inside, Waylon stepped out of a meeting room, followed closely by Simon.,regarding today's lunch arrangements..."

"Didn't I say to cancel this week's lunch orders?" Waylon said, checking his watch. "And make sure the front desk doesn't delay Alexia's entry."

Simon quickly nodded. "Already taken care of. She'll get in without any holdup."

Alexia stepped into the elevator and headed straight for the top floor without any issues.

When the elevator doors slid open, she unexpectedly came face-to-face with Waylon.

He stood tall and composed, the light behind him casting a long silhouette across the floor. Dressed in a charcoal-gray shirt with two buttons left open, he looked effortlessly refined and striking.

But when he saw Alexia, something changed-his usual distant look softened, and a faint smile appeared on his lips.

Alexia's heart gave a small jolt.

She couldn't help but wonder if Waylon smiled that gently at everyone or just her.
They stepped into his office together. Waylon glanced over and said, "Right on schedule, as always."

"Of course, I'm never late," Alexia replied, briefly eyeing the stylish furnishings. "Nice decor, by the way."

Waylon didn't comment, instead, his eyes shifted to the lunchbox in her hands, clearly more interested in what she'd brought. "So, what's on the menu today?"

"You'll find out in a second," Alexia said cheerfully, pulling out a five-layer lunchbox with flair. "Surprise!"

Waylon peeked inside and spotted his favorite sweet glazed ribs, along with a spread of other neatly prepared dishes.

They weren't gourmet, but they clearly took time and care to make them.

"That's quite the spread," Waylon said, looking a little impressed. He hadn't expected her to go all out.③

Alexia chuckled. "Of course, it's not just for you. I'm eating too!"

She'd promised to have lunch with him-there was no way she'd bring just ribs.

Waylon gave a low chuckle. "So the ribs were the only thing you made with me in mind,huh?"

Alexia shot him a look. He stopped talking and reached for a shrimp.

Alexia watched him intently. "Well? How is it?"

He chewed slowly, wearing a serious expression, but didn't respond right away.

"Is something wrong?" she asked, growing concerned. "Too salty? Did I mess it up?"

Looking uncertain, she took a bite herself and chewed slowly, but she didn't taste anything wrong.Watching her confused face,Waylon finally laughed. "It's amazing. Best food I've ever tasted."

Alexia froze for a second, then smirked and gently nudged his shoe with her foot.

Waylon noticed the soft pink tint creeping up her cheeks and ears. His eyes narrowed slightly as he watched her in silence.

After a moment, he quietly looked away, but not before the thought crossed his mind-she was even more adorable than he remembered.

Alexia missed the way. his expression shifted. "Best food you've ever had? That's a big statement," she said with a playful smirk, lifting her chin proudly. "But let's be honest, my cooking skills are way ahead of yours.You know it, I know it."

Cooking was the one domain where Alexia had Waylon completely beat. She didn't brag about it often, but catching Waylon off guard like this was always satisfying.

Waylon let out a quiet huff, noticing how pleased she looked. "There's time. I'll catch up eventually."

Alexia grinned and teased, "Try learning to fry an egg before making big promises."

Waylon gave a strained smile. "Instead of roasting me, maybe you should focus on how to handle Marilee's online smear campaign."

Alexia's smile faded a little. "You've been reading those posts too, haven't you?"

Waylon nodded. "I saw some of it during a break this morning. Alexia, this isn't some harmless joke. She's clearly trying to destroy you."

"I know," Alexia said, still keeping her calm.

He looked at her steadily, his gaze heavy with meaning.there something you want to say to me?"
###Chapter 59 Doesn't She Remind Anyone Else Of Marilee


Alexia leaned back, thinking hard. "It would be great if you could catch my live stream tonight!"

That caught Waylon off guard.

Noticing the tension in his eyes, she quietly nibbled on a shrimp. After swallowing, she said, "I really don't need your help this time. I can handle everything myself."

Waylon's stare grew sharper. "If you're pushing me away, who do you expect to rely on?"

In a matter-of-fact tone, Alexia answered, "Nobody. I can manage just fine by myself."

"Don't you think it makes sense to use the help you have around you?" Waylon asked, a flicker of impatience showing.

Alexia paused and stired her soup, her thoughts drifting. Finally, she looked up and said, "What the Jenkins family did still leaves me feeling both ashamed and furious. All these years spent trying to win their approval, it haunts me even now and keeps me awake some nights. I feel like there's a knot | can't untangle.If I look back and count the good memories I have, they happened with you. Even though I was always running after you, always trying to match you and sometimes making you mad, being around you gave me an escape. For a while, it was as if home life, with all its coldness and pressure, faded away."

Waylon looked at her with eyes that held layers of feeling.

Alexia leaned forward, resting her chin on her hand. She studied him closely. "Seven years have passed.You've accomplished so much, but I'm not weak either."

She never let anything keep her from pressing onward.

Her determination would never go unnoticed.

Waylon furrowed his brows slightly. "Alexia, I've never seen you as weak."

No one grasped the depths of brilliance quite like another mind cut from the same cloth. When it came to Alexia, he saw what the rest of the world missed-raw, relentless talent. Whatever challenge crossed her path, she handled it fast and finished it flawlessly.
Without all the burdens her family piled on her, all those sacrifices and compromises for her brothers,Alexia's reputation would have soared by now.

Her lips curved into a soft grin. "You just have to believe in me."

Waylon didn't offer a reply.

Once Alexia was gone, Simon noticed Waylon standinng in silence, fixed on the sprawling city through the tall window.

"Sir, she's got a fire in her. You might want to just let her do things her way," said Simon.

Waylon didn't move his gaze. "When have I ever held her back?"

Simon gave a small laugh, more uneasy than amused. "It's not like you stop her. But maybe you guard her too closely sometimes. She might start to think you're doing it out of pity."

Waylon gazed forward with captivating eyes, but an undercurrent of irritation showed clearly in his stare."The world is full of people who suffer. Did you ever see me try to protect anyone other than her? It's because she's Alexia-that's why I'm set on shielding her. I don't need reasons, and nobody can tell me otherwise."

Coming back home, seeing Alexia drenched and alone beneath the pouring rain, he understood that no one had stood up for her all these seven years.

Alexia had fought silently, carrying the burden entirely on her shoulders.

Opinions meant nothing to Waylon. In his eyes, extraordinary individuals deserved to remain untouched,never to fade or lose their brilliance.

"She'll go her way, I'Il go mine. We're each on separate journeys," Waylon said with an indifferent air, clearly unwilling to pursue the conversation.

Simon paused, wrestling with his own unease.

He had hoped Waylon would realize the real issue-their unclear connection was the pressing matter.

Without an official relationship, Waylon kept stepping forward for Alexia, putting them both in an awkward situation.

What would she think of him now? They had once stood on opposite sides, and now they hovered in a space that was neither warm nor hostile. If he stepped in, it would feel out of place and she would undoubtedly wonder why.

For the longest time, Waylon had ruled from a cold height, gripping authority like it was owed to him. The gentle ways of a woman often escaped him, and he found it hard to read what lay beneath softness.

At 8 PM, Alexia launched her stream without delay.

Her livestream was overflowing, and the viewer count shot up like sparks from a flame.

Above the buzz and rising chatter, she finally clicked the camera on.

The moment her face lit up the screen, the chat stalled. Words hung in the air as her beauty pulled them all into silence.

The lens caught her perfectly. Her skin looked soft as silk, her features carved with precision. Loose waves of hair slipped down to her collarbone, the ends grazing her skin with effortless charm.

Then the silence snapped. Comments surged like water breaking a dam.

"Hold on. Is she really not using any filters? How can anyone look like that?"

"She looks absolutely breathtaking!"

"I can't take this. Someone screenshot this for me!"

"How is it possible for someone to be this stunning? If only I couuld have her looks for a day."

"She could outshine any actress on the screen with that face."

Then,amid the endless praise, a jarring message slipped in.

"Doesn't she remind anyone else of Marilee? I wonder if her beauty is all hers, or if she had a little help to look like Marilee."
###Chapter 60 Counterattack
The instant Marilee's name popped up in the stream, the whole chat caught on-tonight's entertainment would be all about the showdown between the true and the fake daughters.

Alexia, midway through prepping her ring light for a makeup stream, froze as she caught sight ofthe message. Eyebrows drawn together, she replied, "You think I look like Marilee?"

With a loud snap, her compact case hit the table. "Honey, maybe it's time to getyour vision checked. My face doesn't need to match anyone else's. And if I did copy her? Please, I would be downgrading."

Marilee's loyalists were waiting for a fight. Like clockwork, they flooded the chat, unleashing a barrage of angry comments.

"Who do you even think you are, acting all superior around Marilee? She's the queen of the four rising starlets, and you're nothing but a wannabe!"

"Stop pretending you're some kind of socialite. The Jenkins family tossed you out!"

"And now you're just a knockoff influencer? Are things so bad you're renting some dump and begging for coins from your followers?"

A sly smile crept onto Alexia's lips as she leaned into the camera, chin resting on her hand, lashes fluttering for effect. "Did the sour grapes taste especially bitter tonight? Ever heard the phrase-the crumbs of the rich still feed the poor. Even if I was stuck renting..."

Drawing out her pause for dramatic effect, she casually lifted her phone and swept it around the room.Gilded carvings glimmered along the Baroque ceiling, the penthouse's glow bathing everything in soft gold.She let the silence linger. "I'd still be living in a duplex penthouse."

Viewers zoomed in, instantly spotting the wall of designer bags stacked in the corner. The live chat went eerily quiet.

Anyone watching could tell-she wasn't rushing for tip money.

Yet Marilee'sfans wouldn't let it rest.

"Still Jenkins cash! You stole Marilee's life for two decades!"
"Do you even hear yourself? You're nothing but a fraud!"

"Thief! Once a thief, always a thief!"

Alexia's smile sharpened."Oh, I was waiting for that. How about a little appetizer before the real main course?"

A few taps and she switched to screen sharing, flashing years of bank records from her time with the Jenkins family.

Every tuition payment, every livingexpense was laid bare-tiny deposits, embarrassingly small,lined up year after year.

"Are my eyes working? You mean to tell me she got lessspending money than me? A thousand a month? In this city? That's a joke."

"This is plain neglect. In a city like Afoross, the Jenkins family could have offered Alexia a palace, yet she was left to bunk in school dorms. Every other wealthy kid had drivers or keys to penthouses."

"And all of this happened even before the entire fiasco about her being the fake daughter came to light.What reason did they have for being so miserly with her right from the very beginning?"

"The Jenkins family is nothing short of a complete disgrace. How could they possibly justify treating Alexia in such a manner? Everyone in her social circle would undoubtedly sneer at her because of this."

Packing up her makeup tools, Alexia tossed in a casual remark. "You know, the gossip blogs loved saying the Jenkins family froze my assets, but if anyone had checked, they'd see every car and apartment was always in the company's name. My actual share of the assets? Zero. No way that family would ever give me a real home like this."

A laugh escaped her. "Honestly, I used to ask myself why I was always left out. My brothers ended up with luxury cars and big houses, and the family poured resources into sending them to elite schooIs.Me? I got the leftovers. Everyone keeps insisting I lived like a princess for twenty years, but honestly, it was just normal. It's not the jackpot they make it out to be. If I could trade, I would."

Across the internet, users started piecing together the Jenkins family's blatant favoritism. Daughters? They didn't seem to count for much.

"No way! Alexia's resume is just as good, maybe better, than her brother's. She finished both a bachelor's and a master's in biology at Afoross University. That's a real accomplishment! Meanwhile,her brothers only made it through school thanks to Daddy's wallet."

Instantly, a Marilee fan tried to defend their idol. "Hley, Marilee went to a media college! Why act like that's not good enough?"

Sarcasm filled the replies. "Are you joking? Marilee's 'media college' is just a pretty label-no real admissions process, nowhere near the top universities in the country. The bio program at Afoross University is world-famous. Comparing the two is like putting a supermarket coupon up against a Michelin chef."

Actual students chimed in, exasperated, "As someone from Afoross University, I can't believe how clueless some of you sound. Please, stop embarrassing yourselves."

While the arguments boiled over in the chat, Alexia set a large package on the table. "Let's hit pause on the drama, before we start with the makeup, time for an unboxing. Full disclosure: I didn't buy anything recently,so your guess is as good as mine. If I'm going to freak out, might as well do it on camera. Let's see what's inside."

All eyes went to the battered box. But as the camera zoomed in, sharp-eyed viewers began to notice somethingsinister, dark, dried stains clinging to the corners of the cardboard.
###Chapter 61 Public Opinion Shifts


"Holy crap, something's not right about this box."

"Wait, is that blood on the edge? That color doesn't look right at all."

"No freaking way! You've got to be joking."

With thousands watching in tense silence, Alexia dragged the utility knife across the tape. The sharp blade screeched against the cardboard, cutting through the silence like a scream. Before the box even opened,a sickening wave of rot and decay hit them all.⑪

Her face twisted in disgust as she quickly covered her nose.

A few seconds later, four dead rats spilled out, their bodies slashed and bound together in a grotesque mess.

Pinned crudely to their shredded bodies was a note, scrawled in all caps.

"FRAUDS DESERVE TO BE CUT TO PIECES."

The livestream chat blew up immediately. Warning symbols popped up nonstop as viewers jumped past the three-million mark.

"Oh God, I feel like I'm gonna throw up."

"This is beyond messed up. Marilee's fans have gone completely unhinged! Online drama is one thing, but now it's spilling into real life?"

"The blood is fresh. I can't stop gagging. Poor Alexia. She's dealing with that in person."

"This is criminal! Someone better get the police involved right now!"

With gloves and a mask on, Alexia forced herself through the nausea and closed the box again.

"I need a few minutes to clean up and sanitize everything. I'll be back soon."

As soon as she stepped away from the livestream, the internet exploded. Fan wars lit up every social platform.

#MarleeJenkinsFansCrossTheLine

#MarleeJenkinsMustTakeResponsibility

#FakeDaughterOrFamilyScapegoat

#JusticeForAlexia

Legal experts quickly stepped in, emphasizing that harassment, whether online or in real life, was a serious offense with real legal consequences. Social media lit up with not-so-subtle jabs, aimed straight at a certain celebrity. A lot of users demanded she step up and take responsibility instead of letting her fans run wild and attack innocent people.

Meanwhile, the financial documents Alexia shared lit a fire under the internet. People didn't hold back,slamming the Jenkins family for their obvious favoritism-pampering the sons while treating their only daughter like she didn't exist. The injustice hit home for many, sparking outrage and triggering a massive wave of public criticism.

Tons of people in the chat started calling themselves Alexia fans and went after Marilee's supporters.

"It's wild they're calling Alexia a fraud. She was four when the Jenkins family found her. Didn't bother with a DNA test? That's their mistake, not hers."①

"This is nuts. You're saying the hospital faked the DNA results? Great-show us proof. Name the hospital,show the lawsuit, court ruling,anything. No receipts? Then zip it."

"No court ruling, no facts-just ganging up on a private citizen. If Marilee's upset, maybe she should look at the parents who lost her in the first place. They lost their daughter, raised the wrong one, spoiled the sons,and tossed the fake daughter aside like she was nothing. That kind of neglect seems to be a family trait. No wonder their so-called genius daughter couldn't even handle simple math on national television."

"Marilee's fans are still blaming bad editing for that scene. But she admitted she's terrible at math and science. She only got into college with an art exemption. As an art major myself? I'm honestly insulted."
"And they have the nerve to come after Alexia? She's got brains and looks. Your favorite actress doesn't even come close."

Deborah Sullivan, Marilee's agent, was in total meltdown, watching in horror as the online conversation flipped on its head overnight.

Marilee furiously scrolled through the trending posts and snapped, "Why aren't those threads taken down yet? They're ruining my reputation! Is my fan club full of idiots or what? Totally useless!"

Deborah was sweating bullets. "I've already contacted the platform, but they said the takedown requests were blocked by someone higher-up."

Marilee stared in disbelief. "The platform? They'll do anything for cash-just pay them! We're VIPs. Why would they turn us down?"

"The order came from way above. No removals for three days. No exceptions." And for someone who'd been in the industry this long, even Deborah had never seen a shutdown that firm.

Marilee's cheeks turned red with rage. "So I'm just supposed to take the fall? Let Alexia ride the sympathy train? And what about that actress trying to snatch my movie role? She'll milk this for all it's worth. Fix it.Now!"

Despite her fame, Marilee had racked up a long list of enemies. Her sneaky moves had burned one too many bridges. And she knew this scandal was the perfect opportunity for them to come after her.

Deborah forced a strained smile and said, "No need to panic. We are already shifting the blame onto your fans. Let them take the heat. This is Alexia's fault anyway-her livestream flipped the whole script. We didn't expect her to fight back like this."

The moment Alexia went live, right when the hate hit its peak? That was bold, and Deborah now realized just how badly she'd underestimated Alexia.
###Chapter 62 A Reputation Crisis


Deborah knew their enemy this time wasn't someone to take lightly.

When Alexia rejoined the livestream, the chat had already exploded with comments flying in nonstop.

But she didn't seem fazed. Even though some remarks were clearly meant to provoke, she let them stay.Instead of reacting, she picked up her makeup brush and got to work. "Let's do a simple office makeup look today. And since you're all here for the drama-yes, I'll spill a little tea about the rich and powerful while we're at it."

Just then, a bunch of new accounts started popping up in the stream. Within moments, tips came flooding in, so many that the chat barely kept up.

The leaderboard lit up. Some viewers started competing for the top spots, but one name stayed firmly planted at number one. The top donor-someone going by the name Shepard-was tipping ridiculous amounts, so much that the others didn't stand a chance of catching up.①

Viewers were stunned and hyped. The guessing game started immediately.

"Wait, what's happening? Did all the rich heirs show up just to keep their secrets hidden?"

"No joke, I checked some of their profiles. These people are loaded!"①

"Who is this Shepard guy? His profile's locked, but he's throwing money like it's nothing."⑰

"New account. Zero posts. Only follows Alexia. That's gotta mean something."

Alexia didn't comment. She just held up a bottle of foundation to the camera with a faint smile. "This shade reminds me of theexact same shirt Zayne Jenkins wore when he took my math competition results to his university interview."

The moment she said that, the chat went wild.

Marilee's fans swarmed the stream. "Stop making things up! Where's the proof?"

Alexia gave a low chuckle and pulled open a drawer. She dropped a worn-looking gold medal onto the table with a sharp clink. On the back, instead of her name, Zayne's was faintly engraved, just barely covering up the original.

"Just a few days before the ceremony, I was grounded. The family pulled some strings and had Zayne collect the medal for me. He posed with it, took credit, and never returned it. Later, they tampered with it and swapped out the name. Faking a website, editing records; and tweaking transcripts wasn't hard back then. Ten years ago, it was actually pretty common for rich families to buy their way into top schools with fake documents. But taking your own sister's achievements and passing them off as yours? That's just plain pathetic."

By now, the internet detectives had done their job. All the pieces were falling into place.

"Just checked the official records. Alexia was on the gold medalist list for the International Math Competition ten years ago!"

"She was a legend back in middle school. But instead of going to a top high school, she chose an regular school in Bymill. I remember teachers used to talk about it like it was the biggest waste of talent."

"Ugh, the way some parents play favorites is disgusting."

Right then, a stream of generous tips began pouring in from an account named CarrieK, grabbing Alexia's attention mid-stroke.

Alexia paused her eyebrow drawing and glanced at the camera. "The one tipping non-stop... Miss Kennedy,right? Back when the Jenkins and Kennedy families were arranging a marriage, did Evelyn ever brag to you about Zayne's genius and how he got accepted early into a top university?"

The chat instantly blew up with reactions.

"Wait, this ID looks familiar! Is she talking about Carrie Kennedy-the daughter of that real estate mogul in Afoross?"

"OMG. It is her! She just posted pics from some fancy party, and Zayne's right there, standing by the champagne tower!"

The CarrieK account replied almost immediately, "Yeah, they said Zayne was super smart and a child genius. They hyped him up all the time."

Alexia casually went back to doing her brows. "That's funny. He didn't even qualify to take the same entrance exam as me."
While most of the chat cheered her on, a few critical voices popped up.

"If that's true, why didn't you say anything back then? Why wait until now?"

Alexia placed her brow pencil down and stared straight into the camera. "That's a fair question.Why didn't I fight back? Because no one in my family would've listened. No one stood by me. My parents told me to stay quiet, not to mess up Zayne's future. They said he was the pride of the family, and I was just supposed to support him. They even promised me that if I kept quiet and played along, they'd finally show me the love I'd been desperate for."

She went quiet for a beat, then spoke in a softer voice. "I really believed them. But I was wrong. They lied to me."

That one line hit hard, and a wave of sympathy washed through the chat.
###Chapter 63 Are You Declaring War On Us Now


"Poor thing. Alexia has already been through enough, and now she's getting dragged even more. Some people just have the worst luck."

Just as netizens started venting their outrage, the chat was suddenly flooded with warnings. "Stop spreading slander or face legal consequences!"

Alexia noticed the ID clearly marked as part of Jenkins Group and let out a mocking smile. "Looks like someone's getting nervous."

Her lips curled into a cool, confident smile that caught everyone's attention.

"Wait, was that someone from Jenkins Group? So they were lurking this whole time? That's shady as hell."

"You all saw it, right? Jenkins Group said she's slandering Marilee. She's just bitter because they kicked her out, now she's making up lies!"

"Calm down. Zayne's old application files were already found. They did list him as an International Math Competition gold medalist!"

Completely unbothered, Alexia shot back, "Go ahead and sue me. Let's see what lands first-your legal notice or my court summons."

Jenkins Group's PR team clearly didn't expect Alexia to be so fearless. She wasn't backing down in the slightest.

The live chat was practically on fire.

It was obvious that Jenkins Group had completely lost the upper hand in this public showdown.

Right as the livestream kept heating up, Alexia's phone screen lit up with an incoming call from Evelyn.

Without hesitation, Alexia held it up for everyone to see, a sly smile tugging at her lips. "Well, well, our ever-affectionate mother's on the line. Should I take this call live? What do you all think?"

The viewers flooded the chat, urging her to pick up. But before she could, Evelyn hung up.

"That was fast. Did she get scared?"
"Of course she's scared. A live call would've been a total disaster for her. Gotta say, Alexia's smart for flipping the script."

"She really knows what she's doing. She's playing this perfectly!"

Now that her makeup was done, Alexia looked flawless-her beauty and elegance had the whole chat mesmerized.

She gave the camera a playful wink. "That's all for today, folks. I've got a few confrontations to take care of.I'll stream again when I can. Thank you for the generous tips, everything will go to charity after this. Bye!"

With a click, the stream ended, leaving viewers hooked and begging for more.

"Wait! You can't just leave! I wanna hear the showdown too!"

"The idea of Alexia walking into a showdown with the Jenkins family? I'd pay to watch that happen live!"

"Please, at least post an update later! I need to know how it goes, even if it's just a text post!"

The excitement hadn't even cooled before Alexia picked up her phone and returned Evelyn's call.

Evelyn answered immediately, her voice sharp and angry."Alexia, if you have a problem, take it out on me.Why are you dragging Zayne into this?"

That tone-tight with fury-actually amused Alexia.

This so-called mother-no, foster mother-had spent over two decades treating her like a stranger. Cold,distant, emotionally unavailable.

Since the day Alexia got married, Evelyn hadn't-so much as asked how she was doing. Not once. Even after they cut ties publicly, Evelyn never brought her name up, not even by accident.

But now? All' that icy composure melted away the moment Zayne got involved. How ironic.

With a mocking laugh, Alexia said coolly, "Take it out on you? Isn't that what I'm already doing? Open your eyes. The more I go after Zayne, the more worked up you get. And when I humiliate him publicly,do you really think I'm doing it to hurt Marilee? She's just collateral. It's you I'm aiming at."

There was a brief pause on the line before Evelyn's voice returned-sharper this time, practically seething."We gave you everything for twenty years, and this is how you repay us? Aren't you afraid of the consequences of being so ungrateful?"
Alexia's hand slammed down on the table with a loud crack, making Evelyn jump.

"Ungrateful?" Alexia snapped. "Do you even have the right to say that to me? You humiliated me in front of everyone at Marilee's birthday party-publicly disowned me without warning. Did you ever once stop to consider my feelings? No? Then why should I care about you guys now?"

Evelyn bit back, "That still doesn't give you the right to go after Zayne! You promised me you'd take this secret to the grave!"

Alexia let out a dry laugh. "And I only made that promise because you told me family scandals should stay private. But guess what? You aren't my family anymore. So why should I protect your lies? And besides,you promised me plenty of things too. Did you ever keep any of them?"

Evelyn had no response. The silence dragged on until her voice returned, cold as ever. "Alexia, are you declaring war on us now?"
###Chapter 64 Alexia's Winning Streak In The PR War


"Declare war?" Alexia scoffed. "Here's the deal. Keep your preoious kids in check and make sure they steer clear of me. Otherwise, I'll expose more of your dirty secrets to the public. Is that clear?"

She decided not to reveal everything just yet. She had already discovered the Jenkins family's real motive for taking her in. For now, she kept the knowledge that they only wanted a living donor under wraps, saving it for a time when it wvould serve her best.

Evelyn, too blinded by pride, missed the warning buried in Alexia's tone. Her voice iced over as fury took the reins. "Mess with Zayne's future and you'll find me standing in your way every step."

With a laugh that held no warmth, Alexia answered, "Isn't it something? Your world starts and ends with your son, and anyone who dares cross you gets an earful. Feels like a never-ending fight, doesn't it? Save some of that spirit for Jenkins Group's plummeting shares. Maybe run the numbers on what your beloved business is about to lose."

Rage made Evelyn's voice tremble, and her next words barely broke free. "You little-!"

Alexia bore no resemblance to the girl she had once controlled. She had once been quiet, eager to please,and desperate for scraps of kindness. Evelyn barely had to try to keep her in line.

That ###Chapter was over. Alexia now brimmed with steel and impatience, refusing to tolerate nonsense.

This stark contrast left Evelyn feeling quite uneasy. Forcing herself to bite back, she snapped, "Don't fool yourself into thinking Waylon Mason makes you important. Women like you-always counting on a pretty face-get tossed aside as soon as the novelty wears off."

The words rolled right off Alexia. That tired accusation had lost its sting long ago. With a scoff, she retorted,"Twisting things must be your favorite hobby. Let's be honest-who's getting played here? If there's ever a wedding, trust me, it'll be Waylon chasing after me, not the other way around. Remember that."

Evelyn was left speechless. Alexia had truly lost it. Did this girl have any idea how absurd she sounded?

"Go pamper your fragile son. He must need it," Alexia quipped, then ended the call right away.

Fuming on the other end, Evelyn slammed the phone down so hard it rattled the table. Her rage took over,
and she sent a trail of glassware crashing to the floor. The servants hurried in, tripping over themselves as they scrambled to clear the chaos, all unnerved by a tantrum she almost never showed.

"Somebody better tell Marilee to drag herself back here!" Evelyn barked. "All she does is stir up trouble for her brother!"

Alexia returned to her screen, where a flood of new notifications filled her feed.

Her audience shot past half a million in what felt like a blink, and the numbers just kept ticking up.

Brand offers began pouring into her messages, all hoping to get a piece of the action with deals and partnerships. She turned every one of them down.

The charts topping every social site told the same story-the fake daughter fiasco and Zayne's doctored credentials had gone viral. While Alexia set the first spark, even she never pictured the wildfire reaching this far or burning this fast.

A notification lit up her phone. Ada was sending message after message, barely giving her time to reply.

"I caught your live. You totally killed it! Alexia, your knack for drama is wild. You broke the internet tonight."

"Guess what? Carrie lost her mind after your stream and went off at her folks. She's already saying she'll call off the engagement. Sounds like she never cared much for Zayne anyway. Now she's got a perfect reason to walk away. If she does, that's the end for the Jenkins family-trouble inside and out."

Alexia smirked as she responded, "Things aren't so cut-and-dried. Families like that don't drop engagements over just one video."

Almost instantly, Ada replied, "Maybe, but Carrie's stubborn to the core. Anything can happen. But hey-what's up with the Jenkins family talking about lawsuits? Are you really taking this to court?"

"They're bluffing. All threats, no follow-through. Even if they try, it'll crash and burn before it gets anywhere."

She could pinpoint exactly where the Jenkins family was most vulnerable-Zayne's shaky public image. If she dragged him into the spotlight, they'd spend all their energy trying to mop up his mess, not chasing after her in court.

And who didn't know how to make threats? The Jenkins family was loud but harmless.
If they'd truly had what it took, they wouldn't still be stumbling through life, barely keeping their heads above water, even after all the years she'd spent quietly laying out a path for them.

Back-and-forth messages buzzed between Alexia and Ada while chaos brewed for the Jenkins family.

Desperate, Zayne and his crew pleaded with social media teams to make the trending stories vanish, but they heard the same thing Marilee did-no chance. The pushback from up top was too strong. Nobody dared step in.

Trying to drown out the noise, they unleashed armies of bots across the web, but their rivals had already called in their own digital reinforcements, clogging the feeds even more.

Yet the biggest threat didn't come from behind-the-scenes tactics. Regular people lined up behind Alexia,turning the tide on their own.

Inside his office, Zayne pressed his fingers to his aching temples, fighting off a pounding headache.But Alexia's words from the livestream wouldn't stop echoing in his mind.

"He didn't even qualify to take the same entrance exam as me."
###Chapter 65 What If She Managed To Rise Again


Nothing left a deeper scar than words that cut right through to the core.

Night after night, the sting of the International Math Competition never left Zayne alone. It lingered in the shadows, creeping into his thoughts when sleep refused to come.

He could still remember the day Alexia joined the family and enrolled at his school. That was when he first realized what it meant to share his world with someone who made brilliance look effortless.

All his life, he had been called gifted, especially in numbers. Teachers singled him out. He enjoyed being at the top. Then Alexia stepped into the spotlight. Watching her in action, the self-assurance he once felt drained away, replaced by a quiet, gnawing doubt.

Being the Jenkins family's firstborn was supposed to mean leading the way. Instead, next to Alexia's talent,he shrank back, unsure if he would ever truly belong in the spotlight.

If only the family's expectations had landed elsewhere...

If Alexia hadn't chosen to step aside, turning her back on elite universities, marrying early and becoming a housewife...

He probably wouldn't be sitting in that chair right now.

As Zayne was lost in those thoughts, his phone rang. His mother was calling.

"Don't bother with the gossip online, Zayne. It's nothing. I'll make sure Alexia pays for this. You have my word."

He paused, uncertain, and finally changed the subject. "Mom, what made you pick me? When the family had to pick an heir, why was it me?"

With a dismissive laugh, Evelyn barely hesitated. "Why? Because you're my son. Who else would I choose to take over?"

"And Travis? He's your son too."

"He's just not up to the task. And Alexia? Even worse. Just look at her now-she's nothing but trouble. If we'd handed her the reins, she'd have swept everything away before we even knew it."

Zayne wasn't convinced. "But Alexia has always outshined me."

"Enough. Don't let foolish ideas distract you. Whether you like it or not, you're the head of this family now.You can't falter, not for a second. As for Alexia, she sealed her own fate the day she married Roger. Nobody expects a divorced woman to recover from that, not with her reputation. You have nothing to worry about."

What if she managed to rise again? The thought ran laps in his head, yet Zayne swallowed the words,unable to give them life.

Time after time, his mother had brushed Alexia aside. She spent years planting the idea that Alexia was finished, locked in a loveless marriage with no real future orinfluence.

However, ever since the divorce, support had started to gather around Alexia. Instead of fading into the background, she was turning into a force that nobody could brush aside.

Letting out a quiet breath, Zayne treaded carefully into a new topic. "After the livestream, Carrie insists on ending the engagement."

"She can wish all she wants. The Kennedy name doesn't give her the freedom to play games. This engagement is about business, not romance. Her father wouldn't dare risk it." Resentment flared in Evelyn's chest. "So Alexia wants to stir up trouble, does she? Let her do her worst. You stay focused on the company.I'll deal with everything else."

"Fine."

Once the call ended, Zayne saw Travis leaning against the doorframe, arms folded, a lazy grin plastered on his face as if he'd been standing there forever.

With a look that could curdle milk, Zayne demanded,"What do you want?"

"Just here to visit the star of the shnow. You're all over the internet. Didn't you hear? You're basically a household name." Travis wandered in, flopped down on the office couch, and produced a cigarette with the air of someone who owned the place.

Ignoring the provocation, Zayne demanded, "Not in my office.Put it out."

Travis lit up anyway and exhaled a ribbon of smoke as if Zayne hadn't spoken at all. "Perks of being the CEO -making up your own.rules."
With eyes like storm clouds, Zayne responded, "If you're so bored, I'll send you to one of our remote sites.You could use something to keep you busy."

"And end up stuck in the middle of nowhere, with no signal and nothing but dust? Pass." Travis let out a laugh. "Let me ask you something. Was all that fuss about getting into that fancy university really about ambition? Or was it simply because it was Alexia's dream university?"

A flicker of anger flashed in Zayne's eyes. "You're talking nonsense."

Unbothered, Travis searched for an ashtray, then crushed the cigarette out in the trash. "Touchy,huh?You tanked that deal with Goldrose Consortium. Dad's been fuming ever since. Guess who he shipped off to clean up your disaster? Me. Had me flying all over the globe for new partners. Don't you think you owe me for that?"

Zayne kept his tone cold. "Dad's giving you a shot. You ought to be grateful."

Travis's laughter rolled out, low and full of irony."Grateful? He promised me the whole overseas branch if l land this contract, and even dangled that ten percent stake."

The words seemed to catch Zayne off guard, his face stilling for a moment before he found his footing."Then you'd better not disappoint."

"Don't worry. I won't. By the way, remind me to send Luna a thank-you card. As long as she's not on your side, she's practically my good luck charm." Travis grinned wickedly. "Look on the bright side. Mom's still got your back, fixing all your screw-ups. Must be nice, being her favorite."
###Chapter 66 My Boyfriend Could Handle It


A surge of irritation ran through Zayne as the mockery sank in, his fist balling tight at his side.

With a swagger and a smug look, Travis made his exit soon after making his point clear.

Once Travis had departed, Zayne's secretary placed a cup of coffee on his desk.you shouldn't let his comments get under your skin. Northbay is a challenging market. No one knows if he'll actually manage a win out there."

After a long sip, Zayne asked, "Have you found Luna?"

The secretary shook his head. "Not yet."

Zayne refused to give up. "Don't stop searching. I need to find her, whatever it takes."

By the next morning, Jenkins Group's stock dropped just as many had feared.

Desperate to change the conversation, Evelyn dialed up her media contacts, feeding them salacious stories about well-known celebrities, hoping the public would shift their focus.

Things didn't turn out as she hoped, though.

The celebrity camps hit back hard. Their fans unleashed a tidal wave of accusations and rumors about Marilee, pushing her PR team to the brink.

Later that evening, Marilee sat nursing one drink after another at a bar.

Across from her, Dina looked immaculate in a sleek black designer dress, clearly annoyed by the scene. just a little gossip online. Why let it get to you? That's not like you at all."

"You have no idea." Lowering her glass, Marilee let her head sink into her palm, cheeks tinged with pink. "I can lose to anyone out there, but I refuse to lose to Alexia."

"Is it just because she was married to Roger?" Dina questioned, a crease between her brows. "Roger chose you in the end. Isn't that what matters?"

That answer didn't satisfy Marilee. "Having his heart isn't enough for me. Alexia's name is on everyone's lips, and people can't stop defending her. Meanwhile, all I get is criticism. The internet is against me, my parents nag, and my brothers keep calling me out. How am I supposed to accept all that?"

She honestly believed that her fame would be enough to steer the crowd against Alexia. Instead, everything blew up in her face, leaving her in an even worse position.

Dina thought it over for a moment. "You can't blame yourself for everything. Nobody expected Alexia to be so clever. At least your fans still stand by you. Give it a little time, and things will go back to normal. If you're desperate for help, my boyfriend could handle it. I believe you've heard of the Black Tiger Gang."

Marilee knew her so-called boyfriend was actually her sugar daddy. She lifted her glass and gave Dina a playful grin. "If you actually manage this, what kind of thank you would you like from me?"

With a dazzling smile, Dina replied, "You know, he's been hoping to meet you for ages. Why don't the three of us share a meal sometime soon?"

When Marilee's expression wavered, Dina reached out and squeezed her hand. "Relax. He's got a sterling reputation and is well-connected across the industry. I wouldn't have gotten this far if he hadn't treated me right. He's genuinely interested in meeting you, and maybe he'll want to back your next project. You've got a huge following now, so many investors would line up just for a meal with you. Please, say yes, for both our sakes."

Flattered by the praise, Marilee tapped her glass to Dina's. "Alright, you've convinced me. I'll doit."

Meanwhile, Alexia arrived home after a long day, spotted a fridge full of fresh ingredients, and felt a sudden urge to whip up a feast.

After slipping on her apron, she started to hum, moving easily from one task to the next in the kitchen. In the middle of her preparations, a soft, deliberate knock interrupted her rhythm.

Opening the door,Alexia found herself face-to-face with a woman exuding grace and sophistication.

Standing just beside the woman, Betsey offered a timid greeting. "You remember me, right? Mom and I came to pick up Ginger."

With a gentle smile, Alexia patted the top of Betsey's head. "How could I forget you, Betsey?" She gave the girl's hair a playful ruffle, then turned to the woman at her side. "You must be Ms. Adams."

Serena acknowledged her with a nod. "Yes, that's right. I've been meaning to thank you for what you did. 1really appreciate you stepping in for Betsey-coming here to thank you in person felt right."
Brushing it off with a light wave, Alexia stepped aside. "It was really nothing at all. Please, come inside and make yourselves comfortable. I'll fetch Ginger. He's been on the mend; you'll be glad to know."

With a kind smile, Serena replied, "Thank you so much, and sorry to trouble you."

They soon settled on the sofa, making polite conversation.

Not long after, the unmistakable scent of something burning drifted in from the kitchen.
###Chapter 67 Serena's Dilemma

When Alexia still hadn't shown up, Serena stopped waiting and hurried to the kitchen.

A short while later, Alexia walked out holdng Ginger in her arms, stroking its fur. "You little rascal,hiding under the bed and making me look all over for you."

As she entered the living room, she was surprised to find Serena busy in the kitchen.

Serena turned her head with an awkward smile. "I smelled something burning while you were gone. When I lifted the lid, the stew looked a little charred, so I thought I'd try to fix it before it got worse."

Understanding what had happened, Alexia smiled gratefully. "Thank you, really."

Ginger jumped down from her arms and wandered over to Betsey, who immediately began petting and playing with it happily.

When Alexia stepped into the kitchen, she noticed Serena had already cut away the burnt sections of the ribs.

"Thanks again," she said warmly. "If you're not in a rush, why don't you stay for dinner?"

Serena paused for a moment. "Are you sure? I wouldn't want to impose."

Alexia's tone was light and welcoming. "Absolutely! We're neighbors, aren't we? I ended up making way too much food tonight-no point letting it go to waste. And besides, I really like having Betsey around. Betsey,do you want to stay and have dinner with me tonight?"

Betsey's eyes sparkled with excitement. "Really? We can?"

"Of course!" Alexia grinned.


Seeing Betsey so happy, Serena couldn't say no. "Thank you for inviting us."

As the food finished cooking, a delicious aroma filled the entire space.

Alexia's cooking was exceptional, and even Serena, who rarely ate much, found herself reaching for seconds.
Betsey,meanwhile, was completely focused on her plate.

"Ms. Jenkins, you're seriously talented in the kitchen. Did you learn to cook on your own?" Serena asked earnestly. "These ribs are honestly the best I've ever tasted. Do you have a secret recipe or something?"

Alexia smiled and replied, "Of course. If you enjoyed them that much, I'll gladly share the recipe with you."

Serena's eyes lit up, and she looked at Alexia with open admiration. "That would be amazing. Oh,and I heard you teach at Afoross University? Under Prof. Ellis, right?"

Alexia nodded. "Yes, I did.Do you know him?"

Serena nodded with familiarity."Cosmo Biotech has been working with Afoross University quite a bit recently. Prof. Ellis's lab has played a major role in developing one of our company's newest projects. He's someone I deeply respect."

Alexia smiled. "He mentioned that Cosmo Biotech's newest product might be a game changer in the medical field. Congratulations in advance, Ms. Adams."

But to her surprise, Serena's expression dimmed. The excitement Alexia had expected didn't come. "It's still too early for congratulations. Right now, I just hope Cosmo Biotech survives long enough to even see the summit."

Alexia caught the change in tone and tilted her head, slightly puzzled. "Wait, is something wrong with Cosmo Biotech?"

Serena gave a faint, bitter smile as she began explaining how an unknown force had been targeting Cosmo Biotech through the stock market.

"That foreign short-selling force already crushed several biopharma firms overseas, and now it's our turn.We've tried to build up a defense bybringing in outside help, but honestly, it's an uphill battle." Serena exhaled. "Cosmo Biotech just doesn't have the clout to get backing from any real heavyweights."

Alexia seemed to read between the lines. "So you're banking on the summit, right? With all that international capital and attention, you're hoping to showcase the new product and attract a powerful backer to pul Cosmo Biotech out of this crisis."
Serena admitted, "it's the most realistic shot we have. Every company that's been hit by this short-selling group ended up bankrupt. If wetry to handle this alone, we won't make it."

Alexia suddenly saw Serena in a new light-she hadn't expected her to be this daring or ambitious. "But have you thought about what happens if this doesn't work?"

She moved her fork in a circle, then cut through it as if making a point. "That summit next month? It's not just a business meet-up. It's a power game between top political and corporate players. Whether it's Afoross or Dorbarrow, they already hold all the cards. Their networks are deep-rooted, and they play by their own rules. You think Cosmo Biotech can bounce back with one new product and suddenly draw in big investors and influential allies. But all that-your product, your data, your pitch-that's just your ticket to enter the room. The real battle starts after that."

Serena looked at her, slightly stunned by the clarity of her words. "I didn't expect you to understand financial politics so wwell."
###Chapter 68 How Was That Even A Compliment


Alexia offered a slight smile. "I took up economics as my minor during college."

Serena nodded, gripping her cup a little tighter. "I don't have a choice-I have to bet everything on this.Cosmo Blotech is under attack, and there's no one to fall back on. That summit is the only hope we have."

Alexia spoke plainly, without softening the blow. "If Cosmo Biotech no longer belongs to the Adams family,can you really accept that?"

Serena's shoulders tensed slightly as she slowly put down her knife and fork.

Even Betsey, who had been eating quietly, noticed the sudden tension and glanced at her mother in confusion.

Serena gave a low, dry chuckle after a long silence. "That was brutally honest."

"That's just how this world runs-winner takes everything. Capital doesn't hand out mercy. If you're not ready to risk being gutted, then you're not ready to play. Otherwise, you'll end up like everyone else-served on a platter, picked clean." Alexia's expression didn't change.

Serena's voice was steady but heavy with meaning. "Cosmo Biotech was my grandfather's creation. It's the heart of the Adams family. And as his chosen successor, I won't let it fall into someone else's hands."

Alexia just looked at her for a long moment and said nothing.

She had picked up fragments of Serena's story through Ada here andthere.

Serena hadn't exactly drawn a winning hand at birth. As the overlooked third child of the Adams family, she had no support until Cosmo Biotech was on its last legs. Then she stepped up, tossed out her useless brothers, and took the reins herself.

If she hadn't stepped up back then, Cosmo Biotech would've been history five years ago.

Her personal life wasn't much better-rushed into a marriage, divorced just as fast, and now raising a child on her own while carrying the company's burden.

Alexia, deep down, felt an unexpected flicker of empathy. As a woman, she understood that struggle all too Well.

Dinner wrapped up, and Serena left with Betsey it tow.

Back at her desk, Alexia logged in and shot a message to Moon. "You there?"

The reply came quickly. "Talk."

One icy word-typical Moon. She didn't waste time and forwarded the latest stock chart for Cosmo Biotech.

"Foreign vultures are already circling the company like it's a buffet. And you plan to sit and watch?"

Moon replied, "Not my concern."

"How are you still alive with a heart that cold?"

"You called it a buffet. That means it's meant to be eaten."

Alexia's gaze hardened as the meaning hit her. The message couldn't be clearer.Powerful players in Afoross were all watching Cosmo Biotech struggle, like spectators waiting for the kill.

The real danger wasn't foreign forces, it was the insiders sharpening their knives.

Someone behind the scenes was pulling all the right strings.

Alexia typed back without hesitation. "What if I make a move?"

His response was immediate. "You don't even have a seat at this table."

A quiet laugh escaped her lips.

So that was it. He didn't just think she couldn't help-he was flat-out saying she didn't belong.

"You really think I'm not capable?" she muttered to herself, the corners of her lips curling in a half-smile.

Still, that short exchange told her everything she needed to know. If she jumped in now under the name Luna, Moon would push back instantly.

They'd end up in another head-to-head, and that would only waste time.

No,there were better ways to play this game.

Meanwhile, Waylon closed the financial forum tab and initiated a cross-border video call. A wel-dressed man appeared on screen, skimming a document in a sharp silver-gray suft. "Waylon, I heard you just sank billions into a new energy startup. First time using Ravenwood Financial Group to fund a domestic project. That's unexpected."

Waylon's voice was as even as ever. "It's a solid opportunity. I believe in the sector. Nothing surprising about thai.

The man adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses. "Uh-huh. But here's the kicker-Cowant has been busy playing matchmaker, right? Word is, he lined up a few polished heiresses for you. And one of them? Her family runs deep in energy. So, you respond by investing a fortune into her biggest competitor? Even for you, that's ice cold."

Waylon didn't blink. "I you're that concerned about her feelings, Ryan, why don't you marry her?"

Ryan's expression didn't change. "Hard pass. Been there, done that. Once was enough."

Waylon let out a quiet chuckle. "You're flying back next month for the summit. After that, you'll be stationed in Afoross permanently."

Ryan Walker's brow furrowed. "Why?"

"We're opening a branch in Afoross. You'Il oversee operations and keep tabs on Cowan's people."

There were still unfinished battles with the Mason family, and he hadn't forgotten.

Ryan didn't respond immediately.

Waylon saw the hesitation and asked, "What? Don't tell me you're still not over stepping back into the same country as your ex? If others knew that, they wouldn't need to try and find your Achilles' heel. Flash her picture and you roll over like a puppy."

Ryan's jaw tensed. "You've never been married. You wouldn't get it. You're a damn psychopath."

Waylon gave a light nod, completely unfazed. "Appreciate the flattery. Now stop whining and get back to work."

Ryan sighed.How was that even a compliment?
###Chapter 69 Dirty Threats


Around noon the following day, Alexia wrapped up her lecture and stepped out of the building,heading toward her car in the parking lot.

Just as she neared the basketball court, a troubling scene drew her attention-Brandon was pestering a young woman nearby.

At the court's edge, Brandon's jersey clung to him with sweat. With an oily grin, he reached for the girl's arm,oozing smug confidence.

The girl recoiled at once, her words breaking with tears. "Keep your hands off me! I'm not leaving with you!"

Irritation flashed across Brandon's face. "Tillie, do you understand what you're risking by saying no to me?The Gibson family doesn't even have to try to make someone like you disappear!"

His hand shot out again, aiming for Tillie Sanderson's wrist.

A swift hand yanked Tillie out of reach, followed by a sharp slap to the back of Brandon's hand.

Brandon flinched at the sting,spun around, and found Alexia standing behind Tillie, fierce and unyielding.

Crossing her arms, Alexia fixed him with a glare that could slice through steel. "Brandon, what gives you the right to corner a girl on campus?"

Brandon faltered for just a heartbeat under her stare, but indignation quickly took over.

"What is it with you, Alexia? Why do you always butt in? Can't you keep out of things that aren't your business?"

Alexia's stare didn't waver. "Funny, I was wondering why you're always caught making trouble wherever l turn up. You're harassing a girl, and yet you whine about interference? As a faculty member, it's my job to step in."

Gritting his teeth, Brandon jabbed a finger toward Tillie, who had tucked herself behind Alexia. "She's my girlfriend.What happens between us isn't your concern!"

Worry flickered in Tillie's eyes as she pleaded, "Don't believe him. We're not together anymore! Brandon's just tryìng to force me into drinking with other men, but | won't go!"

Tillie's courage took Brandon by surprise. He gave a bitter, mocking laugh. "Oh, please. You've done this plenty of thnes before. I've got pictures, remember? Don't act like some innocent angel now. The hypocrisy from you broke folks is unbelievable!"

"Does it matter if she's done this before?" Alexia stepped forward, her heeIs striking the pavement with a crisp warning that made Brandon retreat instinctively. She grabbed the collar of his jersey, the cold gleam of her platinum watch stung his eyes. "Pressuring a girl to drink with men and hoarding private pictures-do you think the police care more about your excuses or the evidence you keep on your phone?"

Brandon yanked himself away and flashed a wicked grin. "You really think you can stop me? P'll spread those photos everywhere. The whole campus will know what Tillie's really like! Let's see who's ruined first!"

The threat drained the color from Tillie's cheeks. Tears threatened at her eyes, and a faint tremor ran through her as she whispered, "Please, don't..."

Alexia caught the distress in her eyes. With a reassuring touch on Tillie's shoulder, she signaled that there was nothing to fear.

Only then did Alexia face Brandon straight on, her voice cutting through the air. "Brandon, you really think those pictures make you untouchable?"

A sneer curled Brandon's mouth as he retorted, "Who do you think you are, Alexia? You're just a teacher-don't get above yourself. The Gibsons don't answer to you. You should walk away while you still can, or l'll have Roger fire you myself!"

There was a cool, mocking curve to Alexia's smile. "The Gibson family, you say? Given your misdeeds,their name barely holds together."

Drawing her phone from her pocket, Alexia held it up so Brandon couldn't miss it."I've got your threats on record. Should I send it to the police or let the school board hear for themselves? How do you think they'll respond?"

Shock flashed across Brandon's face. Clearly, he hadn't counted on Alexia playing her own hand.

He clenched his jaw, spitting out the words. "You really think you can threaten me? Roger won't let this slide.Whether you go to the school or the police, it won't change anything."
"Big talk for someone backed into a comer." Amusement flickered across Alexia's face. "But you haven't seen anything I won't dare."
###Chapter 70 Apology


"Tell me, Brandon, do you honestly believe the Gibson family still holds all the strings? After losing your gambling license in Griffinham, your grandfather has been hobnobbing at every banquet, hoping to secure the west city project. Imagine what might happen if this recording and the bid file reached the officials at the exact same time. Think your family would even make it to the bidding round?"

Those words struck Brandon like a flash of lightning, his eyes going wide with shock.

The realization of what she knew sent a wave of cold sweat down his back. "That's not possible..."

Alexia's lips curled into a sly grin. "Is something wrong? Are you feeling nervous?"

Swallowing nervously, Brandon couldn't comprehend how a teacher like her knew so much about his family's affairs.

Every rival his family ever made seemed to flicker in his memory. If this scandal blew up and wrecked the bidding plan...

He shut the thought down before it could go further.

With Brandon still rattled, Alexia pressed her advantage. "Lost your nerve? Think I'm bluffing? That's fine.I'm happy to run an experiment. Let's see who ends up losing more."

Trying to steady his shaking hands, Brandon took a breath. "Please, I was just joking."

He didn't dare to push her any further.

For the first time, he understood just how serious things could get.

A small shake of the head accompanied Alexia's next words. "Not much of a joke, was it? You threatened a teacher today. I can't just let that go. What's your plan for making it up to me?"

In a stiff voice, Brandon forced out an apology.

Alexia's expression never softened. "You owe your real apology to someone else. Who did you hurt most?Apologize to her."

Tillie looked up, startled. She hadn't expected anyone to fight her corner with such determination.
After a long pause and some visible discomfort, Brandon finally muttered out an apology to Tillie. Alexia remained unimpressed. "Say it loud enough for everyone to hear!"

"I'm sorry!"

"And what is that? Are you glued to the spot? If you're really sorry, show some respect and bow."

Brandon gritted his teeth, his fists clenched tightly, but under Alexia's imposing presence, he lowered his head and bowed to Tillie. "I'm sorry!"

Not content, Alexia continued her critique. "You call that a bow? Bend lower, or it doesn't count."

Brandon's forehead was tight with effort.

Before he could grumble, Alexia added, "It's alright if you can't manage it. You'll get a front-row seat when your grandfather has to bow to the officials next time. Take notes from him."

Every word she spoke dripped with mockery and warning, leaving Brandon feeling utterly defeated.

Unable to meet anyone's gaze, he hunched over even more, voice cracking as he yelled, "I'm sorry!"

Their argument quickly drew a crowd, though Tillie seemed frozen in fear. Alexia, unfazed, let out a cold laugh. "Give me your phone."

Hesitation flickered across Brandon's face before he finally surrendered his unlocked phone.

Alexia scrolled through his gallery, erasing every photo of Tillie that crossed the line and clearing out any hidden backups.

When she finished, she tossed the phone back to him, her stare cold. "If you ever bother Tillie again or try to blackmail her, the Gibson family's reputation will be the first to go."

That warning lingered as she took Tillie by the arm and walked away, leaving Brandon standing alone,crushed.

Once they left the basketball court, Tillie couldn't hold back her tears any longer. "Thank you,Ms.Jenkins.I wouldn't have known what to do without you."

Alexia's hand landed gently on her shoulder, her words kinder now. "You don't have to be scared. If anything like this happens again, go straight to a teacher or the office. Never try to handle it all by yourself, alright?"
Tears still glistening on her cheeks, Tillie managed a nod. "I get it now. Thank you."

A gentle smile curved on Alexia's lips."Good. Make sure you grab a meal before you go home."

"Will do! See you!"

As Tillie hurried away, relief settled over Alexia. A quick glance at her watch made her realize she was running behind for lunch with Waylon.

She wasted no time and picked up her pace, heading straight for the parking lot.

Back on the court, realization finally hit Brandon. Though the photos were wiped from his phone, he had overlooked one thing-the recording still remained on Alexia's device.

How could such an obvious detail slip his mind?

A cold sweat broke out as he wondered what Alexia might do with that evidence. She could hold it over him or even threaten the Gibson family.

Driven by panic, Brandon smacked his forehead and dashed off, determined to catch up with her.

In the parking garage, Alexia was unlocking her car, reaching for the door, when an unfamiliar sound caught her attention. Instead of the usual hum of engines, faint whispers curled through the concrete, echoing softly through the space.

Instincts on high alert, she spun around, but nothing met her eyes-just empty shadows.

Just then, a familiar voice bounced off the garage walls.

"Alexia!"

The sound of her name cut through the stillness, unmistakable and urgent.

Looking up, Alexia spotted Brandon sprinting in her direction, closing the distance with every step.
###Chapter 71 Abduction


Annoyance etched across Alexia's face. "Why are you trailing me now?"

Brandon's chest heaved with each breath. "Delete the recording! Do it now!"

Before Alexia could fire back, her phone screen flashed-Waylon's name lit up. She started to answer."Hello."

Brandon lunged forward, reaching for her phone. "Who's on the other end? Give it here! I'll erase the recording myself!"

Sidestepping his grasp, Alexia snapped, "Brandon, enough of this bullshit!"

Waylon, hearing the tension in her voice, frowned on the other end. Brandon? What was he doing pestering Alexia now?

Growing more frantic, Brandon shouted, "Give me your phone! You're not leaving here until I get that recording back!" In a sudden burst, he yanked the driver's door open and dropped himself into the seat.

Rage colored Alexia's words. "Brandon, have you lost your mind?"

Her protest was cut short. Out of nowhere, hands snatched her phone from behind. Metal pressed cold and hard into her side.

A gun. Its presence was unmistakable.

"Don't make a sound," a low voice said in her ear. "Get in the car."

Alexia kept her composure, refusing to let fear show. Without warning, two more men emerged, forcing her roughly into the back seat. Brandon went rigid, eyes bulging with fear. "Who are you?"

A thug pressed the gun barrel hard against Brandon's head. "Keep your mouth shut if you want to stay alive.Start driving."

At that command, every trace of confidence melted away. Fingers shaking, Brandon fumbled with his seatbelt, barely able to steady himself. His eyes flickered up to the rearview mirror, where Alexia's face came into focus.
To his disbelief, she looked back with cold calm. Not a hint of fear or distress crossed her features, nothing like the panic that had seized him.

The car shot from the parking structure, tires screeching, as if it had been fired from a bow.

Waylon stared at his phone in fury, the abrupt call drop fueling his rage. "Simon, bring the car. Now."

Simon, who had heard every word, pieced the situation together-kidnapping. "Mr. Mason, allow me to take care of this."

A glare from Waylon cut him off, sharp as a blade. "I won't repeat myself."

Realizing his mistake, Simon felt sweat bead at his brow. "Understood. I'll handle it."

In no time, the car was ready, and Waylon slid inside, a laptop in hand.

As they sped through the city, blue light from the laptop washed over Waylon's stern face, sharpening every feature.

"Is everyone set?"

Simon dropped his voice. "All teams are in place and fully armed. We tapped intocity surveillance using the license plate. The manhunt has already begun."

Waylon's hands danced rapidly across the keyboard, streaming live feeds from the university's parking lot straight onto his screen.

On the screen, Brandon was behind the wheel, visibly rattled, and the armed thug beside him made Waylon's eyes narrow with pure,lethal intent.

Although Alexia looked unruffled on camera, Waylon recognized the mask she wore for protection-cool,unreadable, but never truly calm.

These men, judging by their ruthlessness, had a history of violence. Waylon understood the stakes.Every second counted if he was going to save her.

As for Brandon-utterly worthless bastard in a crisis.

Cold fury flickered across Waylon's face. He spoke with cutting clarity."Call Roger. Tell him to come pick up his useless cousin,"
Simon gave a swift nod and got to work without pause.

The getaway car screeched to a halt outside an abandoned factory on the city's edge.

Sliding out of the passenger seat, the scar-faced thug led the charge, his crew right behind him.Without warning, they jerked Alexia and Brandon from the car and hustled them inside, leaving no room for resistance.

"Boss, check out the lady-she's something else," one goon sneered, eyes hungry. "You take the first turn.I'll handle the man."

A wicked grin stretched across the scar-faced man's lips as he turned his full attention to Alexia, his gaze crawling over her with shameless anticipation.

Cornered in that rundown building, Alexia's allure only seemed to intensify-long hair spilling over her cheeks, delicate lines caught in the flickering light. Even in plain jeans and a crisp shirt, her figure turned every head.

Nobody could call her ordinary.

No wonder that jealous actress had wanted her gone.

Swaggering over with a mocking grin, the scar-faced thug clicked his tongue."Wel, aren't you something.Never picked up a catch like you before. Behave, darling, and I might just show you some kindness."

As his hand reached out, Alexia smoothly turned away, dodging his grasp as if he were nothing more than a bothersome insect.

For a fleeting second, something dangerous flashed in her eyes. It vanished, replaced by a mocking smile."By the way your men cower, you must be the big boss. Hilarious. Funny how a 'leader'like you has to kidnap a woman for attention. You must really be scraping the barrel these days. I bet you jump at any gutter job that comes your way."

Her words hit their mark. The henchmen's tempers flared, one snapping, "Shut it! We're with the Black Tiger Gang! You think we're some nobodies? You're way outta your league!"

Black Tiger Gang.

Recognition flickered in Alexia's mind. Ada had once warned her about this crew.
The clty's underworld had long been infected by thelf coruption--Black Tiger Gang was infamous for its backroom deals, tron-fisted rackets, and willingness to get dirty for a price.

A sudden gust rattled the battered doors, thet hinges shrieking in protest as wind tore through the ruined factory.

Tilting her head, Alexiá mocked, "So it's the famos Black Tiger Gang? The police is cracking down on yOUF Kind,yet you dare to kidnap me. Your employer must really hate me."

The scar-faced boss seized her chin, leering as he forced her to meet his gaze."Look at that-brains and beauty. Think you'll trick me into talking? Not a chance. You guessed one thing right, though. The police are swarming everywhere, so tonight, we're taking what we want before they find us."

His filthy fingers inched toward the front of her shirt, intent on tearing through the fabric.

Yet just as he moved in, Alexia's mouth twisted into a cold, pitiless grin. In one fluid movement, she slipped her wrists from the rope.
###Chapter 72 Fighting
In a single, decisive move, Alexia seized the scarred man's wrist and sent him crashing to the floor with a judo toss. Swiftly following up, her elbow found its mark at his temple, leaving him dazed and reeling.



Shock widened his eyes as he sprawled on the floor,glancing back to spot the frayed ropes abandoned nearby.



"How did you get loose?" he asked.



Without a word, Alexia only traced her thumb along the delicate ring on her pinky.



Her secret weapon, a ring concealing a silver needle,had proven its worth once again.



The two henchmen lunged at her with iron rods. Alexia spun on her heel, sent a rusted gasoline drum tumbling across the floor, and the noise sent both attackers scattering for cover.



Taking advantage of the chaos, the scarred man whipped out a pistol, voice cracking as he yelped,"Somebody, stop her!"



Gunfire erupted, a bullet shrieking past Alexia's ear and striking the warehouse wall. Another round struck an oil tank in the far corner. Flames shot skyward,bathing the scene in wild, flickering light. Red bloomed across Alexia's shirt, mixing with sweat and smoke.



From behind a pile of crates, Brandon froze at the gunshot, panic flooding his face. On trembling hands and knees, he tried to slink away unnoticed.


His luck ran out. The two thugs spotted his escape attempt and grabbed him by the collar.


"Where do you think you're going?" one sneered,yanking him back.



Brandon immediately broke down, begging, "Your target is her. I have nothing to do with this. I swear,just let me go and I'll disappear! My cousin runs Gibson Group-we're loaded! Please, I'm not ready to die!"



Seizing the opportunity, Alexia made her move,knocking the scarred man to the floor, wrenching the gun from his grip, and pressing the muzzle to his forehead.



Seeing this, the two goons aimed their guns at Alexia."Let him go or you're dead!"


With measured calm, Alexia dragged the scarred man into a perfect defensive position. "Let's find out who's got the quickest trigger," she replied, pressing the barrel harder and forcing his head back at an awkward angle.



A bead of sweat slid down his face. "Don't mess around.What do you know about guns?"



A sudden smile flickered across Alexia's lips. Without uttering a word, she coolly flipped the safety off with her index finger. "Why not take a wild guess? Do l look like someone who doesn't know how to fire a gun?"



A crisp click echoed through the warehouse, the unmistakable sound of the weapon being cocked chilling every ear.



Panic twisted the scarred man's face, and he snapped at his men, "Drop your guns! Right now! Do it!"



Uncertainty flashed between the goons. After a moment's hesitation, both reluctantly set their pistols on the floor.



Alexia took charge, her voice steady. "Brandon,gather those weapons."



Breaking loose, Brandon jerked free and hurried forward, fumbling to scoop up the guns.



Just then, the skinny thug's eyes widened in recognition."Wait,Brandon? You're Brandon Gibson!The guy who owes our boss a billion from gambling?"
Brandon froze in his tracks, color draining from his face.



A spark of realization hit the second thug. "It's him,alright! We've been talking about staging a protest outside Gibson Group just to get our money back!"


Evil gleamed in the skinny thug's eyes. "Brandon, take the gun and shoot her!"



The scarred man let out a furious curse. "Have you lost your mind? Don't you care what happens to me?"



Shrugging, the skinny one grinned. "Boss, there's a three-hundred-million bounty on her head! That's serious money. If you end up as collateral damage maybe the big boss will give us a little bonus. Brandon,if you fire your shot and help us take her down, there is a good chance our big boss will turn a blind eye to what you owe him. There is room for us to sit down and discuss the possibility of settling what you owe from your gambling.



Greed flickered in Brandon's eyes, and Alexia caught the hesitation. "Think before you act, Brandon. They'll toss you aside the second they get what they want."



The skinny man's voice rose sharply as he argued,"This is not about taking advantage of anyone. It is about working together as a team! Brandon, you need to see it clearly. If you join us in bringing her down, we will have her completely at our mercy. We can hand you a copy of the recording, and she is worth more than you think. With that in your possession, you will have thepower to force her into submission, and you will be free to demand anything your heart desires!"
###Chapter 73 The Fatal Moment
Brandon's grip tightened on the weapon, and he swung the barrel toward Alexia without the slightest hesitation.



Malice glinted in his eyes. "Don't put this on me.You're the reason I'm tangled up in all this. If you're angry, save it for whoever set this trap."



He squeezed the trigger. In a blur of motion, Alexia shoved the scar-faced man in front of her, the bullet punching through his chest.



With a gasp, the scar-faced man crashed to the floor,his body landing hard in front of the others.



No sooner had he fallen than the skinny thug lunged forward,snatching the gun from Brandon's stunned hand,and barreled after Alexia.



Lead whined through the air as bullets pinged off metal beams, orange sparks slicing past Alexia's side The gunman's shouts and wild curses bounced through the empty warehouse.



A quick check of her magazine revealed two rounds remaining.

That would have to do.



Wiping grime from her brow, Alexia scanned the space and spotted a half-open steel cabinet twenty meters away.



Boots pounded closer from the northwest, their precise rhythm hinting at military discipline.



She yanked the ancient breaker from the wall,copper wires exposed, and let them scrape against a nearby pin. Electricity sizzled as sparks flared.



The bald pursuer charged in, but Alexia reacted first,kicking the tangle of live wires straight at him. Metal met copper with a jolt; high voltage shot through his body, sending him convulsing to the floor.



Death claimed him in a matter of seconds.



A howl of rage tore from the skinny thug as he watched his companion's ggrisly fate. Fury overtook him,and he hurled a steel pipe toward Alexia.



She sidestepped the attack, leveling her pistol and squeezing off a shot in reply



A frantic warning burst from Brandon."Watch out!"



Reacting to the shout, the skinny man jerked his head aside just in time for the bullet to graze his ear.
A shriek erupted, panic overtaking bravado.



But for Brandon's call, Alexia's shot would have been lethal.



Alexia gave Brandon a frosty glare, mouth curling into a cold,mocking sneer.


"Come out, coward!" The thug's voice was ragged with fear and fury. "You think you can hide forever?I know that gun only has one round left! When you're out, I'll be waiting, and you'll beg for mercy!"



Staring at the long shadow she cast on the wall,Alexia recalled her teacher's words. With a single bullet left,she had to become that bullet. Defeat wasn't an option.



Crouching behind a barricade of barrels, Alexia grabbed a stray wooden stick and tossed it left.Predictably, the skinny thug's aim shifted,gun tracking the noise.



She moved in a heartbeat. Both pistols fired, and her foot lashed out, kicking the weapon from his hand The sound of a bullet ripping through flesh mingled with the heavy thud of broken ribs.



Pain ripped through the skinny man as he crashed to the floor, hacking and gasping, only to realize his foot was bleeding, a bullet having torn straight through.
Movement was impossible.



Frustration spilled out in a fist pounding the concrete."Damn it!" he spat, fury and humiliation etched on his face.



What a cunning woman!



Seizing her opening, Alexia sprinted for the exit,determination etched into every step.



Eyes narrowed, the skinny man slipped a dagger from his pocket and tossed it toward Brandon.



This was their last chance.



Brandon paused, torn by doubt.



Yet as he considered Alexia's fierce and stubborn spirit, he realized with a sinking feeling that if she managed to slip away now, it would only be a matter of time before she returned to hunt him down.



And it would mark his complete and utter downfall.



Dread settling in his gut, he snatched up the blade and tore off after Alexia.



Outside, Alexia darted into the open, scanning frantically. Her gaze landed on a white car, tucked away in the shadows of the corner lot.
Behind her, footsteps thudded urgently against the pavement.



Spinning around, she found herself facing Brandon's crazed eyes and the gleam of a dagger driving straight for her.


Wildness had seized him. "You're not getting away this time!"



A gunshot cracked through the night, sharp and sudden.



One bullet found its mark in Brandon's wrist. The knife clattered to the ground as he howled, collapsing in agony. "My hand! You've ruined my hand!"


Blood mingled with the cold night air, the metallic scent thick between them. Alexia's instincts kicked in;she whirled to see Waylon, radiating icy fury.



Within seconds, agents swept in and pinned Brandon to the ground. Simon stood to the side,eyes flicking to Waylon, surprise flickering in his usually unreadable gaze.



From Korbin, such violence would have been expected; he had been raised on military tradition,hardened by a life at the front.



But Waylon's place was in the polished halls of the elite. He was revered for his composure, a man others looked up to for his calm and unshakable grace.



Whenever he desired it, there were countless individuals eager to carry out his most unsavory tasks.



However, when it came to Alexia, he found himself willing to bend his own rules and grant her a rare exception.
###Chapter 74 His Embrace
 Relief flickered across Alexia s face as soon as Waylon appeared, her eyes lighting up while the tension in her shoulders melted away.


Though part of her had guessed that Waylon might trace trouble after their sudden phone disconnect, she had tried not to let herself hope.



Depending on anyone else had always felt riskier than counting on herself.



Before Alexia could come up with a story to explain the dead bodies of the thugs, Waylon was already there, wrapping her tightly in his arms.



His hold was fierce-unyielding, as if he could somehow protect her by keeping her close enough to become a part of him. He tucked his chin against her hair, breathing in the subtle scent, and with that, the storm inside him finally settled.



Pinned to his chest, Alexia could make out the wild,uneven thumping of his heart. The heavy beat vibrated through her own ribs, and before she could stop it, her pulse started racing in response.



A brief shock ran through her. She realized it was Waylon's embrace that had set her heart pounding so fast.



All around them, people took in the scene-some whispered behind cupped hands, a few stared, and others quickly looked away



Finally, Waylon released her, his arms dropping back to his sides.



A quick scan took in every detail-dust on her cheeks,smudges on her clothes-but her eyes still shone bright and impossible to ignore.



His gaze turned stormy when he noticed the streak of blood on her arm. Picking up on his mood,Alexia shrugged, voice light. "Just a scratch from the bulet.Nothing serious."



She hesitated only a moment, then offered a faint careful smile-completely sidestepping the fact that he'd just held her as if he'd never let go. As though nothing had passed between themat all. Instead,she asked, "So what brings you here?"



Waylon didn't hesitate. "You were in trouble. How could I not come? I'm just glad I made it in time."


Surprise flickered in Alexia's gaze, her eyes going round as Waylon's words sank in.



A gentle wind stirred, teasing the loose strands of hair on her forehead. Fot a fleeting second she wondered if spring was finally softening the citys edges. the breeze brushing her skin like a memory



The moment passed. Waylon s focus cut to Brandon.sprawled on the ground, twisted with pain and barely able to move.



His face hardened to stone. Without so much as a backward glance, he gave his order, voice cold enough to freeze. "Break his hands and legs."



"On it," came Simon's immediate reply.



Brandon's entire body went rigid. Dropping to his knees, he crawled desperately, voice shaking as he pleaded, "Mr. Mason, please! I'm begging you-don't!I didn't want any of this, I swear!"


A sneer played on Waylon's lips. "Who do you think you're begging for help? If you want forgiveness, turn around and ask her."



For a moment, Brandon seemed paralyzed. Then he turned, only to find Alexia looking back at him with a cold, unblinking stare.



Tears streamed down his cheeks as he dragged himself to her, sobbing. "Alexia, please, I'm sorry.I mean it! We're family. Think of my grandmother. Let me off, just this once! I'll never do anything like this again,I promise!"
Alexia's eves only grew colder her brows drawn tight "You're no family of mine Dont reach for something that isn't there."



In her world, loyalty was everything. Betrayal left no room for forgiveness



Simon moved without delay, giving a silent signal. His team grabbed Brandon and hauled him up, offering no compassion at all.



A baton tipped with jagged steel came down,smashing into the back of Brandon's knees with brutal force. The sickening crunch of bones snapping shattered the stillness of the factory, echoing like a gunshot.



For a moment, no sound escaped Brandon's lips-his mouth stretched wide in a silent scream before pure agony ripped the noise from his throat. The resulting howl was enough to chill the blood.


"Brandon!" Roger, who had just arrived with his crew,caught the tortured scream the instant he climbed out of the car.



He sprinted toward the sound, only to find Brandon lying on the ground, covered in blood, his legs broken.



Teeth gritted, Roger shot Waylon a look of dark fury."What the hell have you done to him?"
"You should be asking what hes done. Waylon's voice came back lee cold, a rare flash of anger sparking beneath thte words.



The temperature in the area dropped with Waylon's outburst, a suffocating chill sweeping through the space. No one else dared to move or even meet his gaze.



Roger's chest tightened, dread settling deep in his gut Facing Waylon's wrath was never easy.



From the ground,Brandon reached out, face twisted in agony. "Roger, help me..."



With fists clenched at his sides, Roger hesitated, then forced himself to bow his head before Waylon,humility creeping into his tone. "Whatever my cousin's done,the Gibson family will make amends.Please,let us set things right."



A slow, dangerous smile crept onto Waylon's lips,equal parts refined and menacing. "If you're serious about that, you can start by dropping to your knees and begging Alexia for forgiveness."
###Chapter 75 Refuse To Bow His Head
The moment the words left Waylons mouth, the space was filled with heavy tension



Every gaze snapped to Roger and Alexia, expectation simmering in the charged air.



Roger blanched, his skin turning ashen, shoulders locking up as if the weight of the moment was turning him to stone, pride fracturing under the strain.



He turned to Alexia; mixed feelings struck him-shock,disbelief,humiliation...



For a split second, Alexia's brows rose in genuine surprise, but her self-possession was back almost instantly.



Their standoff lasted only a moment before Roger dropped his eyes, shame washing over him



Waylon didn't so much as blink, his voice cold and dismissive. "If kneelingis too much for you, then disappear."



Roger's fists curled until his knuckles threatened to split, the sound stark in the charged quiet.
He glared at Waylon-the same figure who'd always cast a shadow over every entitled heir in the city, a mountain none of them had ever managed to climb.



Even now, with years behind them. Roger found it impossible to meet Waylon's gaze without feeling that old sting of being lesser



Waylon had always wielded power like a scalpel-slicing egos, cutting pride, never breaking a sweat as he did it.



"Roger, you have to help me," Brandon whimpered from where he lay sprawled, but Roger didn't move,his silence speaking volumes



Nothing horrified him more than the thought of losing face in front of Alexia-groveling, admitting guilt,or falling to his knees was unthinkable.



In his mind, he'd done nothing to deserve this.



Waylon sent Simon a meaningful look, and Simon caught on instantly.



Without a word, one of the men seized Brandon's injured hand, raised the blade, and cut off two fingers



A sickening snap rang out, followed by a screamn so sharp and desperate it seemed to slice the air. Blood streamed from what was left of Brandon's hand as he writhed,his curses breaking into pitiful raqqed sobs



Simon watched the scene unfold, gaze steady From the way the hand hung limp it was clear Brandon would never use it again



"Brandon..." Only then did Roger lurch forward desperately pressing on the wound, face drained of color.



Brandon's eyes, red and brimming with pain, glared at his cousin. "Why didn't you do anything?"



Unable to face him, Roger kept his head down, guilt eating at him.



A low chuckle rumbled from Waylon's chest. He turned to Alexia and ran a hand lightly through her hair, as if nothing grim had happened.



"We should go," he murmured, his voice soft, leaving everyone around them stunned.



Alexia stared at him, bewildered, but after a beat,she gave a small nod.



Waylon's eyes dipped to her shoes for a brief second.Before she could react, he leaned down and swept her into his arms with practiced ease.



Surprise locked her in place, her mind whirling.Instinctively, her hands gripped his shirt, her heart lurching in het chest I'm fine Just a few scrapes l can walk," she whispered



A hint of warmth crept into Waylon's gaze as he offered a playful remark, saying. Oh, sure. Battling gangsters in heels and getting off with a few scrapes?That's something else. But I'm carrying you anyway Indulge me,will you?"


As usual, his logic left her with no comeback.



Waylon's stride was unhurried, each step steady as he made his way to the sleek black sedan. Simon,always a step ahead, swung the door open before they reachedit.



Settling into the back seat, Alexia paused, her voice low. "What about the bodies in the factory?"



A shadow crossed Waylon's eyes. "Don't concern yourself. I'll take care of it."


She met his look, her tone turning earnest. "Thank you.Seems I'm racking up favors | can't repay."



A quiet sigh escaped him. "No debt this time. Let it go."



He reached for a medical kit resting on the seat, as if he'd anticipated every need. Their driver, catching on,raised the partition, leaving them in a cocoon of silence.

Alexia started to object. but Wayion's next command stopped her cold. "Take off your shirt


She stiffened, caught off guard. Are you going to check my injuries? It's nothing serious, really!"



Waylon didn't look away, his eyes steady and unreadable. "You can undress yourself, or I'll lend a hand.Your choice."



Alexia shot upright. "I've got it! I'll do it myself!"



Her quick reply drew a faint, almost teasing smile from him,tinged with the faintest disappointment.



Today she'd thrown on a basic button-up. As her fingers stumbled over the top button, she felt lucky that she'd worn a proper bra instead of her usual tape.



By the time she reached the last button, her hands had started to tremble, just enough to give her away.


With the shirt falling open, pale skin and a patchwork of bruises and cuts came into view-a silent testament to the violence she'd barely survived.



Waylon's jaw tightened, his features darkening. Just seeing her injuries made his chest ache with a cold,silent rage. What those thugs suffered wasn't nearly enough.

If it were up to him, Brandon would already be buried beside them.



Saying nothing, he cracked open the medical kit,soaked a cotton pad in antiseptic, and began tending to her battered skin with deliberate care.



As the cool liquid met her wounds, Alexia flinched,letting out a sharp hiss. "Ouch! That burns..."
###Chapter 76 Waiting For An Explanation
"You know how much it hurts. Stop trying to shoulder everything alone," Waylon remarked, his tone low and insistent.



Alexia shook her head. "That's not how life works.Sometimes you have to push yourself past the edge.If you want any shot at surviving, you learn to count on no one but yourself."



Waylon's eyes narrowed at her stubbornness, and with pointed deliberateness, he pressed the swab harder against her wound, almost coaxing tears from her eyes.



"Ouch, that stings! Stop! I'll handle it myself." Alexia barely got the words out before the car jerked to a sudden stop, sending her tumbling into Waylon's lap.



The unexpected closeness left Waylon frozen for a heartbeat, a surge of unfamiliar heat racing through him.



His ears turned an unmistakable shade of red,though he kept his face carefully composed.



Cradled against his chest, Alexia felt just as flustered She staited to push herself upright only to realize he'd instinctively tightened his hold in that split second. All she could breathe was the clean.unmistakable scent of his cologne, so familiar and strange all at once.



Her cheeks bloomed with color as well



It was Waylon who finally let her go after an awkward pause.



Neither quite knew where to look, both of them rattled by the moment.



Once he'd finished patching her up in silence, Waylon glanced at her pale face, his expression earnest."Alexia, you need to stop loving Roger."



For a moment, Alexia could only stare at him, caught off guard.



Her first impulse was to say she'd stopped loving Roger long ago.



Yet when she caught the gravity in Waylon's eyes something different slipped out. "Then who do you think I ought to love?"



Waylon's brows lifted, a flicker of surprise passing over his face at her unexpected reply



"That's up to you, isn't it? But Roger? He's not worth your time."


Waylon had never bothered to hide his low opinion of Roger, not even when they were kids.



Even during the years Alexia saw him as her competition, always bracing for a fight, she could never bring herself to be harsh with Roger.



But for Waylon, Roger was just an annoyance. He had never viewed Roger as any real threat, especially not when it came to the things that mattered to him.



Sometimes he wondered what strange twist of fate made him care so much about Alexia, or why someone as remarkable as her ever bothered with someone like Roger. But that curiosity never dug deeper than idle thought.



Now, looking back, he sometimnes wondered if things would be simpler had he claimed her for himself from the start.



Alexia let out a quiet snort, brushing off his concerns "At the last charity gala, I already told you. Roger's ancient history."



She felt no need to re-examine her past devotion to Roger-whether it had been out of love, guilt, or duty,it didn't matter anymore.



The true measure of moving on was reaching a point where the old entanglements faded leaving behind only indifference and the desire to never revisit them again.



Waylon grinned, a glimmer of satisfaction in his eyes."You've always known how to make a clean break."



"That's rich coming from you." Alexia couldn't help thinking his words always sounded backhanded."You didn't hesitate to hit 'block' and cut me out, either."


That jab caught Waylon off guard. His smile faltered for a second.



He ran a hand over his jaw, genuinely wounded as he dug up old memories. "If I recall, you were the one who told me you never wanted to see my face again You shut the door first."



Heat rose in Alexia's cheeks as she scoffed, "Can't a person say something in the heat of the moment?Honestly,you cut me off over one outburst? Then you block me everywhere, slam every door. You're just so cold, like nothing ever rattles you, always keeping your distance."



That particular history had always been a sore spot.She never managed to let it go without letting some sarcasm slip out.



Everyone was stubborn back then. Alexia took pride in her independence, while Waylon always seemed untouchable, as if nothing in the world could shake him



Sure, maybe she'd been the first to say something cruel. Did that mean she deserved to be shut out completely?



He'd slammed the door on her without a second thought, not even pausing for an apology. In Waylon's world,connections were just strings to be cut when he felt like it.



No matter how much time passed, thinking about it still got under her skin.



Waylon was surprised by the flash of anger on her face. "I thought we put that behind us last time you forgave me."



Why did it still sting for her?



Alexia fixed him with a hard stare. "You never even told me why you cut me off. Was it really so trivial?Why did you disappear without a word? By the time l asked for an explanation, you were already boarding a plane-telling me you'd never set foot here again."



She remembered being the one racing to the terminal to catch him, hoping for a real goodbye, believing their friendship mattered.



As the memories came rushing back, Alexia was almost startled by the force of her own feelings.
She'd convinced herself she didn't care anymore, that these questions had faded with time, but the knot in her throat and the tears prickling at her eyes proved otherwise.



She had always been waiting for an explanation.



Waylon caught the hurt in her eyes, saw how her anger trembled on the edge of tears, and for a moment,he was lost for words.



A sharp ache stabbed through him, cold detachment dissolving as regret took its place.
###Chapter 77 You Don't Need To Be Sorry
Waylon lowered his eyes. "I left the country because of my mother. Back then, her health was failing-her mind, too. She needed care, far from here. And,honestly,my family's chaos didn't help. According to their plan, I was never meant to come back at all."



Something in his tone sent a ripple through Alexia.She hesitated before asking, "Now that you're here again,your mom...?"



"She's gone."



That revelation left Alexia wordless, the air between them heavy.



Waylonbusied himself with the bandages, wrapping her wounds with practiced hands. "When her illness took hold, she became anxious and possessive. She cut me off from everyone I knew. But I can't hold it against her-she was sick. I remember who she used to be. She was extraordinary, before all that."



Once the last knot was tied, he met her eyes, earnest and unguarded. "I owe you an apology."



A gentle ache stirred in Alexia's chest, as if an old at rhost wound was being touched.



She shook her head. "You don't need to be sorry."



This time, she finally forgave him.



She'd always known what Waylon's family had been through. His mother,Jordyn Mason,was Cowan's only daughter, and three decades ago, she had been the brightest star in the upper circles. Graceful,generous,and remarkably gifted, she drew admirers wherever she went.



Despite her allure, Jordyn never married. Waylon was born with no father in sight-a fact that drew its share of whispers. But as the years passed, the gossip faded into silence.



No one in the city could rival Waylon. He had grown into the Mason family's living legacy, eclipsing every shadow that came before him. Yet behind all that strength stood Jordyn, whose careful guidance shaped his early years.



The car glided smoothly to a stop at Orchid Estate.



Confused, Alexia glanced out the window. "Why are we at your place?"



Waylon answered matter-of-factly, "Santino will look you over, just to be sure. You'll stay here tonight-it's easier that way."
"Butlreally am fine. These wounds don't even count,"she replied, but then caught the uhyielding look in Waylon's eyes-one that made it clear the decision was not up for dlebate.



"Fine. One check-up. You win." With a sigh, Alexia gave in, the fight going out of her.


Waylon seemed pleased with her answer, his face relaxing. "Any cravings for dinner?"



Alexia wasted no time rattling off a list-one fiery,rich dish after another, each more decadent than the last.The longer she went on, the deeper Waylon's frown dug in.



"You just got hurt. None of that for now. You need something light."



Alexia slumped in disappointment. "So what was the point in asking?"



A sly grin played on Waylon's lips. "I just wanted to know what to serve you next time."



That answer made her pause, caught off guard.



Once they left the car and stepped inside, they saw Santino waiting for them. The moment he spotted Alexia, his face lit up."Alexia! It's been forever!" He opened his arms wide for a welcoming hug.
Before Santino could get any closer. Waylon slipped in front of him. voice laced with mock disapproval "Tone it down. There's no need to make a scene."



The sharpness in his words made Santino falter, nearly tripping over his own feet.



With wounded dignity, Santino shot Waylon a reproachful look. "Not a shred of appreciation!basically watched you grow up! So rude!"



Amused by their squabbling, Alexia grinned and reached out her hands. "It's been ages, Santino."



Santino had once been both Jordyn's trusted physician and the ever-patient school doctor. Back in those days, Alexia had a reputation for stubbornness and a knack for trouble, earning her more visits to the infirmary than anyone else. She was impossible to forget.



They hugged each other as Santino took a moment to study her. Though a hint of pallor lingered on her cheeks, her energy was unmistakable-far better than the last time when she was sick and heartbroken.



With a knowing look, Santino teased, "I can see it in your eyes-you've been in another scrap. When will you stop getting into trouble, even now?"



Alexia folded her arms across her chest. "It's not my  requests now?"



He confirmed with a small nod. "Only if it's classical."


A rush of nostalgia hit her, and she smiled. "I never realized you could be this easygoing."



Waylon shook his head. "This isn't just a whim."



"So,what's the reason?"



His gaze softened. "I want to make you happy."
###Chapter 79 You're Impossible

Alexia's pulse quickened, her heart thumping in her chest.



She watched Waylon in the hush of the music room.the only sound the lazy stretch and occasional meow of the cat curled nearby.



It took a few moments-and Waylon's mildly curious look-for her to collect herself and return to the moment.



With a quick shake of her head, she straightened up,trying to appear composed. "All right, let's see what you can do with Chopin, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky."



Waylon went still, eyebrows raised in mock disbelief.



She shot him a mischievous grin. "What's with that look? Don't think I'm so easily impressed."



His calm didn't waver. "I'm game if you are. But are you sure you have the patience to listen to the whole set?"



Alexia retorted, "Since when do you think I give up so easily?"
Before another word could pass, the housekéeper's head appeared in the doorway. "Dinner's ready. Mr Mason, Miss Jenkins."



Alexia switched gears in a heartbeat. "Actually, food first sounds good!"



Waylon's quiet laugh followed her out of the music room.



Seated at the table, Alexia eyed her own plain,carefully portioned plate, then glanced longingly at the colorful,mouthwatering spread set before Waylon.Her voice dropped to a mutter, eyes narrowed with envy."Now that's just cruel."


Waylon kept his attention on his meal. "I told you already-bland food's the rule if you want to heal properly. It's for your own good."


"Still... this is punishment, not a meal." Alexia pouted,gaze fixed on the spicy shrimp nearby. That shrimp looked impossibly juicy, and she could almost taste it in her mind.



Lost in her craving, Alexia's daydreams were shattered as the very piece she'd been eyeing disappeared-Waylon had snatched it right off the platter. He met her wounded glare, popped the shrimp into his mouth without a hint of remorse, and then flashed her a teasing grin. "Delicious, actually. Want a bite?"
Alexia nodded so fast, it was almost comical


Waylon teased, "Guess you'll have to imagine how good it is."



Alexia shot him a scowl. "You planned this, didn't you?Had the housekeeper make all my favorites, filled the table with temptation, and then stuck me with this hospital food just to torture me?"



Waylon pretended to consider it, then replied,"I thought it might cheer you up. Even if you can't eat it,maybe the smell and sight will lift your spirits a little."



Alexia huffed, barely able to contain her frustration."Waylon, you're impossible. You're definitely doing this just to mess with me."



It was its own kind of torture-being forced to watch,unable to join in.



Waylon just blinked,all wide-eyed innocence, as if he hadn't the faintest clue what she meant. "You've got it all wrong."



Alexia's hands curled into fists, trying to hide how much it got to her.



His mouth said one thing, but his eyes told an entirely different story.
No surprises there-he was absolutely wicked.



A spark of mischief flickered in Alexia's eyes as a new plan formed. "On second thought," she declared,voice bright. "I want the full set-Chopin, Mozart,Tchaikovsky, the whole lot! We're pulling an all-nighter, and I'll be right here making sure you don't back out!"



Waylon froze mid-bite, then slowly set his fork back down. "That's a rather devious move."



The housekeeper watched their playful back-and-forth, her laughter hidden behind her hand.



Determined to win, Alexia launched into her late-night "supervision."



Yet fatigue from the day's chaos quickly caught up with her. Waylon, sly as ever, eased into a series of soothing lullabies, and before long, she'd surrendered -fast asleep on the sofa.



Once the last melody faded, Waylon turned to find her curled up, lost in dreams.



He crossed the room quietly, kneeling beside her to take in her peaceful expression.



Soft,steady breaths lifted her chest; her lashes brushed faint shadows onto her cheeks. Reaching out,
he gently tucked a strand of hair away from her face.



After a long nap, the cat stirred, stretching before springing onto the sofa it crept toward Alexia's outstretched hand, ready to curl up beside her, but before it could settle in. Waylon scooped the feline up and whisked it out of the room without a hint of apology



Morning brought a new visitor. Korbin arrived to see Waylon.



He stepped inside and immediately paused, catching sight of a pair of almond-toned heels with bright red soles lined up perfectly by the door-an unexpected detail that caught him off guard.



Korbin stood in the entryway, momentarily stunned.Had Waylon finally ditched his bachelor ways and invited a woman home? The sight of those heels was proof enough.



Word around town was that no one-aside from the staff-could set foot in this house unannounced. Even Cowan himself called ahead. Any woman allowed past the door had to be someone extraordinary.



"Seems Waylon had company last night." Korbin nodded at the shoes. "Come on,tell me-which lucky lady stayed over?"



While trimming her potted blooms, the housekeeper replied,"You know her too."



Korbin sprawled across the sofa, legs crossed,looking completely at ease. "I know many people. If I'm expected to guess every possibility, it might take all day. But if I had to pick the most likely candidate..."



His thoughts drifted to the charity gala, where Waylon had crowned Alexia in front of a crowd, sending whispers rippling through the room.
###Chapter 80 He Might've Gotten The Wrong Idea...
Korbin shook his head. Waylon and Alexia? Had they really buried the hatchet that quickly? Gone from sworn enemies to some kind of tender, intimate duo in the blink of an eye? That didn't sound like Waylon at all.



Korbin's thoughts were spiraling into wild speculation when the sound of footsteps descending the staircase snapped him out of his daze.He looked up-and there Alexia was, draped in soft loungewear.


Korbin's eyes nearly bulged from their sockets. No way-Waylon's mysterious love interest was actually her?



"Holy shit, it's really you?" Korbin blurted, springing off the couch in sheer disbelief.



Alexia froze, stared at him for three tense seconds,then wordlessly turned on her heel and strode back upstairs without a glance more.



Korbin stood rooted to the spot, baffled."Hey-wait!Why are you leaving? Where's Waylon? Didn't he spend the night with you?"
But Alexia didn't so much as flinch. Her pace quickened as she made her retreat.



Halfway up, she crossed paths with Waylon, who was just descending. Her expression tightened slightly as she leaned in and asked under her breath, "Where are the clothes I changed out of yesterday?"


"They were ruined. Obviously, I tossed them," Waylon replied matter-of-factly. "I've already ordered replacements-they'll be delivered soon."



Alexia bit her lower lip."Oh...okay."



She made to hurry past him, but Waylon reached out,catching her by the arm with a frown. "What's the rush?"



"Korbin's downstairs. He might've gotten the wrong idea about us. You should probably go explain." With that,she pulled her arm free and disappeared into her room.



Downstairs, Korbin watched Waylon approach and slung an arm over his shoulder. "Unbelievable! You finally get together with her and don't even give your best friend a heads-up? That's cold, man."



Waylon brushed him off coolly and gestured for a servant to bring two cups of coffee. "Don't overthink it. She was kidnapped last night, got injured, and stayed here to recover. That's all."
"Really?" Korbin's expression shifted from curiosity to concern. "Who was behind it?"



Waylon's eyes darkened. "Black Tiger Gang."



"Those bastards again." Korbin let out a low wvhistle and dropped onto the sofa. "Their old backer was Dane Warren, and you already wiped out his whole faction. And yet they still have the guts to make a move on someone close to you?"



Waylon remained composed. "Just because Dane fell doesn't mean there aren't others. Black Tiger Gang's survival never hinged on one backer alone."



When Dane' empire collapsed, it left behind a vacuum,and opportunists had rushed in to claim what they could. The Black Tiger Gang was just a blade hired by whoever paid the most. And as long as they remained useful, someone would keep swinging them.



Korbin read between the lines, his brow furrowing."They've had their claws in the entertainment industry for decades. It's been their playground. Sure, they're just thugs, but rooting them out completely won't be easy."



Waylon offered a faint smile, one laced with menace."They're more useful as bait-draw out the bigger players behind them. But first, they need a reminder of who they're dealing with."
The word "reminder" made Korbin tense. He was a soldier. His way of handling threats was blunt and direct.



But Waylon was a politician. A politician's tactics could be more lethal than a blade, more poisonous than a vial of cyanide.



And when Waylon said "reminder," Korbin knew things wouldn't stop at the Black Tiger Gang. The ripples would spread, sweeping in others, and the blood wouldn't just be theirs.



Noticing his friend's grim silence, Waylon took a measured sip of coffee. "So,what brought you here today?"



Korbin snapped back to the present. "I've been assigned to an overseas counterterrorism mission."



Waylon's gaze sharpened. "And your grandfather approved?"



The Douglas family had built a legacy across three generations of decorated soldiers. Korbin's grandfather was a legend-a name etched into military history. And as his only grandson, Korbin had long been groomed to carry that torch.



But after Korbin's father's sudden death, the old man had nearly pulled Korbin out of the military altogether just to protect what remained of the line



Korbin had refused,though.



He met Waylon's gaze, eyes steady. "If I just coast on my family's name, what would our legacy even mean?Soldiers prove themselves through battle, not lineage.I've waited long enough. The world shifts fast. And sometimes, all it takes is a word from people like you to redraw the board."



Waylon arched a brow. "That's quite the criticism.I didn'trealize you held such dim views about our friendship."



Korbin smiled faintly. "I'm only saying it because trust you. My family needs to rise further. My grandfather's cautious now-too cautious. But every family faces that moment. You either advance or become obsolete. And a militaryfamily without victories is nothing more than a broken gun."
###Chapter 81I Think He's Trying To Win My Affection
In Korbin's eyes, nothing mattered more than protecting the family's honor and carrying on its legacy.



He was driven. He couldn't stand the idea of the Douglas family falling behind or staying idle.



To him, holding power was like sailing through rough,unpredictable waters. If a family didn't have goals or direction, they could easily lose their way or even sink.



After listening, Waylon rested his hands on his knee,fingers clasped. His posture alone showed he wasn't someone easily swayed. "Alright then, what do you need from me?"



Korbin didn't hesitate. "I've been assigned to bring down the Styx Organization. You probably know their name-they've been playing with biochemical weapons for years. But lately, they've stepped it up-smuggling in illegal drugs and even kidnapping people for human experiments. It's becoming a major crisis."


Waylon frowned at the mention of that name. "The Styx Organization has deep international roots. Their network is a mess of shady deals and violent attacks.
The government's been wanting to take them down for years, but wasn't that mission originally meant for Richard Hayes? Why are you the one handling it now?"



It was a fair question. Korbin had made a name for himself in special forces, but given the Douglas family's influence, most assumed he had been placed in the military more for experience than actual danger



People didn't expect someone from such a powerful family to be thrown into the worst missions



"Richard is getting old." Korbin gave a casual shrug "The commander trusts me, and | acted fast-volunteered without telling my grandfather. So if anything happens to me out there, I'm counting on you to look after my grandfather and Ada."



Waylon looked at him with a deep gaze. "You're betting everything on this."



For noble families, protecting the bloodline was always a top priority. Most of the time,high-risk missions went to those with less to lose. People from powerful families usually took the safest, cleanest path to promotion.



Korbin grinned."So what? I've got what it takes to be a general. A man who's scared of taking risks doesn't belong in the army."



Waylon stepped closer, placing a firm hand on Korbin's shoulder. His voice was steady. "Then do one thing-come back alive."



Meanwhile, Alexia didn't have to wait long. Soon,the housekeeper knocked on the door, herarms full of shopping bags. "Miss Jenkins, the new clothes have arrived."



Alexia thanked her and brought the bags inside.



She opened the bags and stared at the clothes for a moment.



Everything was high-end, limited edition. Just the jacket alone was worth more than twNo hundred thousand.



After slipping into one of the outfits, she went downstairs, only to realize Korbin was already gone.



She turned to Waylon and offered a polite goodbye."Thanks for your help. I've got to get back to work.I'll transfer the money soon. And if you ever need something from me,just ask."



Waylon arched a brow. "Money? What money?"


She gestured at the jacket. "The clothes. That alone cost two hundred thousand."



Waylon's expression stiffened and his tone turned flat."No need to act so formal with me. I don't like it."
Alexia narrowed her gaze, folded her arms, and stepped closer. "You don't want to be friends, and yet you won't accept payment either. Waylon, what exactly are youI playing at?"



He didn't flinch, and took a step closer. "Shouldn't l be asking you? You're smart. Haven't you figured it out yet?"



As his handsome face leaned in, Alexia's heart skipped a beat.



A quiet battle of wits began between them



She met his intense gaze and pretended to stay calm."I don't know what you're talking about."



Waylon gave a slow smile, his eyes locked on her like he could see right through her. It was getting harder for her to keep pretending. "You know exactly what mean."



Once,no one had known her better than him.



Alexia didn't push back. Her fingers curled into her palms-this felt too much like the mind games they used to play.



Only now, the game had changed. She felt clumsier and more unsure.
"Waylon, your vague talk is seriously irritating," she muttered after a long pause.



Waylon chuckled. "And you're cure when you say yes and mean no."



Flustered,Alexia turned away first, her cheeks warm."Fine, since you're feeling generous, I won't bother paying you back."



With that, she left in a hurry.



Once she got into the car, she sat quietly for a bit,thinking. After a moment, she messaged Ada.



"I have a feeling Waylon's planning something, and it has to do with me."



Ada replied right away, "What?"



Alexia answered, "I think he's trying to win my affection."
###Chapter 82 | Came Here With A List Of Grievances Myself

Ada scanned the message and nearly let out a laugh right then and there.


She weighed her response for a good minute before sending anything back.


"Honestly, Waylon's got his eye on you-that's a major plus! You could totally reel him in. Guys that good-looking are made for a little harmless flirting,especially when it's Waylon we're talking about.Whoever ends up with him will have bragging rights forever!"



Alexia retorted, "You're impossible."


"Be real-with a face and body like his, you're not even a little tempted?"


That comment made Alexia pause. Her mind wandered for just a second.
The idea of being with him didn't seem so outrageous after all.


While she was lost in that thought, a new notification lit up her phone-Waylon's name on the screen.


The suddenness made her fumble, almost sending her phone flying.


Once she pulled up the chat, she saw that Waylon had dropped a file on Leif Saunders-one of the thugs that had kidnapped her.


A short message followed. "Leif cracked during last night's questioning.Marilee's the one who ordered the kidnapping. All the proof is in your inbox. What you do now is up to you."


Attached to the message were a handful of photos and a damning audio file.


With a tap, Alexia listened as Leif's terrified voice broke down, his confession spilling out between panicked screams.


Rage simmered beneath Alexia's skin. She'd suspected Marilee's involvement ever since the Black Tiger Gang grabbed her, but hearing the full admission made her blood boil.


Marilee hadn't been satisfied stirring up a mob on social media-she'd gone so far as to hire criminals to have her kidnapped. If she hadn't managed to escape or if Waylon hadn't shown up when he did,the outcome would have been unthinkable.



"I'm not going to spare her this time." Alexia's lips curled in contempt.



The Jenkins family clearly hadn't learned their lesson.





She tapped her fingers on the wheel, shifted gears,and floored it toward the Gibson family's.


The Gibson family was in uproar.


"Grandpa, you can't let this slide! Waylon has crossed every line!" Brandon sobbed, clutching Allen's leg in a desperate plea. Allen's gaze landed on his grandson's bandaged hand, and his heart twisted with pity.


Brandon had spent the night in the hospital after losing two fingers; now, newly discharged, he was determined to get justice.



When Allen first learned what had happened, the shock and fury nearly knocked him off his feet.


Eleanor's eyes flashed with anger, though her words came out cold. "You had it coming. Maybe now you'll think twice before sneaking off to those casinos."


Gloria's expression soured instantly. "Eleanor, how can you be so heartless? This is all on Waylon. No matter how many times Brandon messes up, he had no right to go that far! It's a direct insult to our family!"


Allen's gaze darkened as he turned to Roger, who stood quietly by. His anger spilled over."Why are you just standing there? You were present, weren't you?Why didn't you stand up to Waylon and defend Brandon?"
 Roger's eyes flicked to Brandon, who sat weeping on the floor. "Brandon started the trouble. And besides,Waylon showed up with numbers on his side. What was I supposed to do-fight a losing battle?"


Brandon's voice cracked, wounded. "Roger! How can you say that? If you'd just gotten on your knees before Alexia, I wouldn't have lost mny fingers!"


The words barely left his mouth before Roger snapped, his composure fracturing. His usually calm face hardened as he jabbed a finger at Brandon."Why should I kneel for you? I just bailed you out of a five hundred million debt, and now there's a one-billion charge waiting at mny company! You expect me to pay for your messes and beg for mercy too? When will you take responsibility for yourself, Brandon?"


Roger's rare outburst stunned everyone. Suddenly,the entire hall fell silent.


Disappointment hardened Eleanor's features as she fixed Brandon with a withering glare. "Another billion in debt, Brandon? Are you set on driving the Gibson family into the ground?"
Brandon's frustration exploded. "Isn't it enough I've lost my fingers? Must you keep piling on the blame?Would you only be satisfied if I was dead? This time I was the victim and our whole family got humiliated,but all you care about is the money! You claim I'm sinking the family, but when I'm in trouble, not a single one of you steps up! Even Alexia has Waylon fighting her battles. What use is family if you all turn your backs on me?"



His tirade jolted Allen from his silence.


Though his patience with Brandon had worn thin,Waylon's treatment of the family gnawed at his pride.He took a heavy breath. "Brandon may have made mistakes, but Waylon's disrespect cannot go unanswered. I'm going to visit the Mason family and demand justice!"


He was halfway to his feet when the doors flew open and Alexia swept into the living room,her presence sharp as a blade. "Demand justice? That's funny-l came here with a list of grievances myself!"
###Chapter 83 You'll Lose Your Remaining Fingers Too
The sharp voice made Brandon lift his head suddenly, his hands curling into tight fists.


It was Alexia.



She had the guts to show up again. If she hadn't seduced Waylon, he wouldn't be in this disaster now.


Roger looked up and saw Alexia step in, the light behind her outlining her figure.


Ever since the divorce talk, she seemed to shine more each time he saw her. There was something different about her-stronger, sharper. Roger found himself watching her, unable to look away, which had never happened in the past.


And truth be told, he hated how his feelings had changed.
Alexia had slapped him three times in the courthouse, yet the only thing stuck in his mind afterward was the look in her eyes-hurt and furious.He couildn't get that out of his head.


Gloria quickly got up and stepped protectively in front of Brandon. "Alexia, what do you want?" she demanded, her tone sharp and defensive.


Alexia gave a cold smile. "I came to deal with Roger and Brandon." She threw a glance at Roger. "Where's Marilee? Isn't she usually glued to your side?"


Roger avoided her eyes. "Marilee had things to do.Not everyone is as free as you."



The truth was, Eleanor had told him not to bring Marilee home. He didn't want to risk upsetting his grandmother, sohe didn't argue.


When Eleanor saw Alexia, her usual cold face softened a little. She waved kindly. "Come sit,Alexia."


Alexia replied calmly, "Thanks, but I'll stand."
Eleanor looked a bit let down by her answer.


Brandon shoved Gloria aside and stormed toward her. "You've got some nerve showing up! I swear, I'll make you pay!"


But before he could get any closer, Roger stepped in and blocked him. "What the hell are you doing?"


Brandon, now even angrier, glared at Roger. "I should be asking you! Why are you stopping me from giving her what she deserves?"



Roger let out an annoyed sigh. "If anything happens to her, you'll lose your remaining fingers too."


He didn't support the idea of Allen going after Waylon for answers either.



When Brandon got kidnapped, Waylon had given Roger the heads-up to rescue him. If Waylon really meant harm, he wouldn't have sent any warning at all.


Both of Brandon and Alexia were kidnapped. If Brandon hadn't sold Alexia out and messed everything up, Roger could've flipped the situation and pressured the Black Tiger Gang to wipe Brandon's debt clean.



But sadly, Brandon was more of a burden than help.


Brandon let out a mocking laugh. "You're scared-even in our own territory! I thought you had guts,Roger. Clearly, I was wrong!"


Alexia smirked coldly. "Why so worked up, Brandon?Didn't losing two fingers knock some sense into you?Maybe Waylon should've cut off all of your fingers."


"Grandpa, are you hearing this? How can she talk like that?" Brandon exploded with rage. "She ruined me,and she still dares to mock me!"


"That's enough!" Allen tapped his cane hard on the floor, his tone tight with control as he looked at Alexia."Why are you here?"


Alexia's voice dripped with sarcasm. "I came to talk about the divorce terms. Roger wants to kick me out with nothing. Everyone says your family's known for being generous, but I guess that generosity doesn't extend to the women you cast aside."


"What? Roger's leaving you wwith nothing?" Eleanor's fury surged, her finger trembling as she pointed at Roger. "Is this how you treat her? What about all those promises you made?"


Roger's expression turned cold. "She signed the prenup herself. She wasn't supposed to get much from the start. And now that she has Waylon backing her, she doesn't need a dime from me. Sure, I cheated, but she's no saint either. I don't plan on giving her a cent."


Gloria added with a scoff, "Yeah, like you actually need the money. That outfit alone probably costs tens of thousands-it's a limited edition from some luxury brand. It looks to me like you're living quite comfortably. So why go after my son's money? lf you're strapped for cash, just hit up Waylon. Or are you saving up in case he dumps you one day and you end up with nothing? That would be a smart move-very clever of you."
Gloria had always had a sharp tongue. From the day Alexia married into the family, she became Gloria's favorite target-someone to mock and nitpick at every chance. While Gloria basked in the surface-level respect Alexia showed her as an elder, deep down, she never truly wished Alexia well.
###Chapter 84 Confrontation
Alexia stood tall in the face of their derision. "You've lost the right to negotiate with me. Marilee paid criminals to abduct me, and Brandon tried to kill me.How ironic, Roger-these are the very people you hold dear."



Her cold words hung in the air, each syllable sharper than the last.



Roger went rigid at the accusation, Marilee's name knocking the wind from him. "Alexia, that's outrageous! Don't throw wild accusations around.How could Marilee possibly be involved?"


Allen and Eleanor exchanged worried glances,anxiety creeping into their features.


Allen's voice was gravelly. "Someone needs to explain what's happening here."


Eleanor's tone softened, supportive. "Don't let them intimidate vou, Alexia. Start from the beginning Tell us everything.


Under their urging, Alexia laid out every detail,holding nothing back.


As her story unfolded, the tension in the room grew thick-her ordeal was almost tangible.


Allen's hands clenched as he listened, his anger rising with every word about Brandon's treachery.


Eyes stinging with disappointment, he rounded on his grandson. "You're an utter disgrace!"


Had Alexia been telling the truth-and if Brandon hadn't turned traitor halfway through-she could have handled the Black Tiger Gang alone. The Gibson family could have flipped the whole situation,wiped out the gang, and cleared Brandon's debt in one stroke.


But thanks to Brandon's lack of foresight, everything fell apart.


Once so boastful, Brandon now shrank under Allen's furious glare, not daring to utter a single protest.


Alexia's voice was cold with contempt. "Maybe Brandon's attempt to kill me was someone else's idea, but Marilee hired the Black Tiger Gang to kidnap me. Roger, how do you plan to answer for vour girlfriend's crimes? You'd hate for her dirty laundry to become public, wouldn't you? It'd be a shame for her to be blacklisted and hounded out of show business."


She tapped her phone, letting the recording fill the room with Marilee's unmistakable voice.



"Alexia's at Afoross University. Grab her in the parking lot. You know what to do after that, right?Don't forget to send me the video when it's done.And make sure Roger gets a copy anonymously-l bet he'll love watching it."


Gloria's composure crumbled. "Why drag Roger into this? Even if this is all true, blame the Jenkins family for raising Marilee so poorly!"


"Oh? You think he can just walk away from this scandal?" Alexia's reply was cold, her gaze pinning Roger to the spot. "Roger, you once publicly declared you'd marry Marilee, even if it meant wearing the stain of adultery. With that kind of love,I'm sure you'll stand tall and face the consequences,won't you?"


Eleanor's complexion drained of color. "I will never accept a woman like her into this family! Roger, pick up your phone. Call Marilee here-now!"


Roger hesitated, voice faltering. "She might have other commitments right now..."


Eleanor shot him a withering look. "If she doesn't show up today, she can forget about ever setting foot in this house again!"


Left with no options, Roger made the call and arranged a car to fetch Marilee.


When Marilee finally arrived, anxiety clung to her.She scanned the room, confusion written on her face, until her eyes landed on Alexia-standing there with a cold, imperious presence.
A sense of foreboding crept into Marilee's chest.


Trying to sound innocent, she moved toward Roger."Roger, what's the matter? Why does everyone look so serious?"


Eleanor shot to her feet and delivered a stinging slap."You dare play dumb with me?"


The smack erased every ounce of pretense from Marilee's face, fear glimmering in her eyes."Eleanor..."


"Don't call me by my name-we're not friends, and we're certainly not family," Eleanor retorted. WVithin the Gibson family, even Allen respected her authority.


Alexia offered a graceful, mocking glance. "Drop the act, Marilee. Seeing me here in one piece-does that ruin your day? Or are you too busy wondering what happened to your hired goons?"


A jolt of panic flickered in Marilee's eyes; her heart thudded painfully in her chest. How on earth did Alexia uncover her plot so fast?
Biting her lip, Marilee forced a weak smile. "I have no idea what you mean. Alexia, are you always this paranoid? You see conspiracies everywhere."


Alexia's smirk widened. "Paranoia or not, the truth always has a way of surfacing in court."


She pressed play on her phone, letting Marilee's incriminating words echo through the room once again.


With each damning sentence, Marilee's face drained of color. A chill crawled down her spine as beads of cold sweat broke out along her skin.
###Chapter 85 Panic
When Roger saw Marilee's pale face and how quiet she was, he asked in disbelief, "Marilee, is that really you?"


Marilee quickly shook her head, her eyes welling up with tears. "No, that's not me! Alexia, how can you say that voice is mine? Watch what you say-l can sue you for slander!"


Alexia arched an eyebrow and smiled coolly. "The call came from a number tied to your real name. Still in denial? We can always let the court handle it. I've got witnesses and experts ready to confirm the voice.But maybe it won't even get that far. Once this audio goes public, I'm sure the entertainment world would love to step in and teach you a lesson. Isn't that so,superstar?"



Marilee's face turned red. "You're disgusting!"


Alexia narrowed her eyes and sneered, "Me?
Disgusting? You weren't saying that when it was you playing dirty. You just can't handle it now that the tables have turned. I won't stop until you've lost everything."


Marilee froze at the cold smirk on Alexia's face. A chill ran down her spine, and without thinking,she moved behind Roger for cover.


mf you try to destroy my name, you'll be fighting the Jenkins family and Roger too! My parents raised you,Alexia. And this is how you repay them? You're cruel and ungrateful!"


Alexia's gaze turned icy. "Still playing the victim? Not even a hint of guilt. There's no point in dragging this conversation out."



Before she could walk away, Eleanor reached for her hand. "Alexia, I understand you've been hurt. I truly do. But can we please handle this quietly? Let's not drag the Gibson family into this..."


Eleanor cared deeply about how the Gibson name was seen. Roger and Marilee's affair wasn't exactly a secret in their social circle, or even among fans, but so far, it hadn't gone public.


She and Allen had always wanted Roger to move into politics. Things hadn't gone.as planned, but if his reputation was completely ruined now, he'd never get another shot.


And since Marilee was still tied to Roger, any hit on her would end up damaging him too.


Understanding the risk, Eleanor lowered her voice and pleaded, "Please, let's settle this in private."


Her hands shook slightly as she held Alexia's,something Eleanor had rarely ever done, showing how desperate she was.


That moment stirred something deep inside Alexia.Her heart tightened with mixed emotions.


Growing up, the rest of the Jenkins family had kept their distance, but Eleanor had always shown her warmth. To Alexia, she was more of a grandmother than anyone else ever had been. It was because of Eleanor that she tried to get close to Roger back then -just so they could be friends and share happy moments.


"Eleanor, I've told you everything. If I hadn't been lucky, I wouldn't even be standing here today. I gave everything to this family after I married in. I did my part-whether it was running the house or looking after Gloria when she broke her leg. I was there, day and night, for two years. But what did I get back? A husband who cheated, a mother-in-law who never stopped criticizing me, and years of being treated like | didn't matter." While speaking, Alexia held out her hand,showing the rough calluses on her palm.


"After the divorce, I couldn't even look at my hands without wondering what kind of spell I'd been under.Why was I bending over backward for people just to be seen as a good wife? A good daughter-in-law?And then it hit me-what's the difference between that and being a maid? Except maids actually get paid."


 
Her words cut through the air like a blade. No one could say a word. They were stunned into silence.


Gloria, however, flushed red with shame and quickly lashed out. "Well, you only have yourself to blame for not getting pregnant! Two years have passed, and still no child. The Gibson family won't keep a woman who can't have kids. If you can't give Roger an heir,it's a disgrace to him! This marriage needs to end!"


Her harsh words made Roger, who'd stayed quiet all this time, go stiff. "Mom, this has nothing to do with Alexia."


Allen suddenly turned to Roger, eyes wide. "Are you impotent or something?"


The question made both Roger and Marilee freeze in place. Marilee knew better than anyone about Roger's capabilities.


"No. In two years of marriage, I never touched her."Roger clenched his teeth.


If he was being honest, a part of him regretted it now.


Eleanor and the others stared at him in disbelief. But it was Gloria who reacted the most-she looked as if she'd just been slapped. It didn't make any sense to her.


From the start, she'd disapproved of Alexia. The girl was just too pretty-far too noticeable. Even before marriage, Alexia had attracted the attention of countless men. There had always been buzz around her.


In Gloria's eyes, someone like that spelled trouble.


And sure, after marriage, Alexia toned herself down.She dressed modestly and acted respectfully,but Gloria never bought into it.



So she kept pushing Alexia down with insults and cold words, thinking it was the only way to keep her in check.



But now, hearing that Roger had never even touched her?



This marriage had never been real to begin with, so Alexia saw no point in pretending anymore. Roger was a fool-he had the perfect opportunity handed to him and still managed to throw it away.
###Chapter 86 | Want Him To Walk Away With Absolutely Nothing
Marilee latched onto Roger's arm like her life depended on it, the two of them looking like a pair from some overdone drama.



Allen chuckled bitterly and shook his head. "If you had insisted on marrying Marilee back then, do you think we could've stopped you? The Jenkins family isn't some giant we couldn't touch. Roger, you always play it safe, and that's exactly why you keep losing."


Had Roger defied them at the time, Allen would've been furious but also proud. At least then, his grandson would've shown some backbone, some drive to take control of his own life. But instead,Roger had become a man who couldn't even manage his personal affairs, let alone accomplish anything meaningful.
Allen never liked interfering in Roger's private life,but in his opinion, no real man would let both his marriage and his family spiral into such chaos.


Roger had really let him down.


Meanwhile, Brandon, who'd been watching everything like a spectator at a show, suddenly laughed out loud. "So Roger's heart was always with Marilee, huh? Two whole years, and he never once touched you, Alexia. How pitiful! No matter how hard you tried, you were never the real deal. No matter how tightly you hold on to what doesn't belong to you, it'll eventually slip through your fingers and return to its rightful owner."


"That kind of marriage, that kind of man?" Alexia scoffed. "No, thanks. Since the divorce talk, life's been way better. There are tons of men out there who are more decent than Roger. His so-called loyalty? Not even worth pocket change. If Marilee wants it, she can have it-I'm not interested."


Roger's face darkened, his fists tightening at his sides."Alexia, do you really have to be so cruel?"
 Marilee stood by his side with tears in her eyes, but inside, her heart was burning with rage.


Alexia met Roger's eyes without a shred of hesitation. "Does it sting to hear the truth? Good.That's exactly why I said it. What are you going to do about it? Endure it, just like I had to."


Roger looked like he was going to explode, but Alexia turned her attention to Brandon, who still had that smug look. "By the way, Brandon,aside from trying to kill me, remember that other nasty thing you did?I wasn't bluffing-push me again and I'll forward that report straight to the top brass before the bidding even starts. Forget the bid; the Gibson family won't even get to show up."



Brandon's grin disappeared in an instant.


Allen picked up on the tension and frowned. "What report? What is she talking about? Brandon, what exactly did you do?"


Eleanor could sense the whole thing spiraling out of control. She gently held Alexia's hand, her tone Abs..urgent. "Alexia, please, can you do this for me? I know I'm asking a lot, but if you just agree to let it go and not report anything, I'll give you whatever you want.Anything."


Alexia looked down at Eleanor's aged hands gripping hers tightly, as if she were the only hope left.


"And how exactly do you plan to fix this, Eleanor?"


Eleanor's eyes lit up with a hint of hope. "How about this? You and Roger finalize the divorce right away,and he gives you half of his personal assets.Would that be acceptable?"


Roger's head shot up. "Absolutely not! We signed a prenup, and she's not entitled to much. Why should she walk away with half my wealth now?"


Eleanor's patience snapped. "If you don't agree,Marilee's reputation will be ruined, our family will lose the bid, and Brandon might end up behind bars.Don't you get it? Sometimes you've got to pay up to protect the bigger picture. I don't care if you love her or not, at the very least, you shouldn't be this stingy  or cruel."


Eleanor's words left Roger completely speechless.He could only grit his teeth and stare at the floor.


Turning back to Alexia, Eleanor softened her tone again. "Alexia, would that be acceptable to you?"


Alexia didn't even flinch. Her voice was flat. "Half?That's too generous. I want him to walk away with absolutely nothing."

###Chapter 87 There Was Still Hope For A Comeback

The second those words left Alexia's lips, the entire room went still-every pair of eyes locked on her in disbelief.



Roger was the first to snap. "Have you completely lost it, Alexia?" he barked with fury flaring in his eyes.


Gloria was seething. "You want my son to walk away with nothing? Do you even hear yourself? After everything he's worked for, you think you can strip him clean? Keep dreaming!"


Marilee, though careful not to upset Alexia right now,also thought the demand was ridiculous. Surely Allen and Eleanor wouldn't actually go along with this.


Alexia just gave a casual shrug. "Alright then, see you in court. Good luck making it to next week's bidding,though."

As Alexia began to walk off, Eleanor reached out quickly. "Wait, Alexia! We can still talk. Nothing's set in stone yet!"


Roger's brow furrowed as he growled, "Grandma,did you not hear her? Let her walk away-l'm not agreeing to this madness!"


Allen's voice rang out sharp and cold. "Enough! Not another word from you!"


Roger was caught off guard by the scolding from both grandparents. A sinking feeling began to grow in his chest, warning him that things were about to get worse.


Allen's eyes didn't waver as he spoke to Alexia. "T'll give you two-thirds of Roger's personal assets.That's the best offer."


Alexia slowly tucked a lock of hair behind her ear, her voice calm but firm. "Not enough. I want him to walk out with nothing."


"Alexia..." Eleanor's voice trembled, almost pleading.
Can't you rethink this?"


Alexia shook her head lightly, flashing a sugary-sweet smile. "I've been more than reasonable. Is Roger's money really worth gambling the entire Gibson family's future? If I leak whatI've got, it won't just block your bid-it'll bring the whole empire crashing down. And trust me, both your grandsons will go down with it."


Eleanor was shocked by how calm but cold Alexia sounded.



She looked like a totally different person-strong and sharp, like a knife ready to cut.


Roger gritted his teeth and snapped, "You don't have to take everything, Alexia! You're getting too greedy.Don't push your luck too far!"


Alexia tilted her head, pretending to be confused."Why are you shouting at me? You should be blaming your brilliant cousin and your equally clueless girlfriend. Oh, and let's not forget-you cheated on me. Obviously, there's a price for that. And seriously,
a who turns down more money? If you handed me the whole Gibson family, I'd manage just fine."


That offhanded comment sent a cold shiver through everyone in the room.


Watching their stunned faces, Alexia broke into a cheerful grin. "Oh, come on. Don't look so scared.I was just joking. Relax."


Gloria jumped to her feet and pointed at Alexia."Enough of the games! Just say what you want and stop acting all high and mighty! Don't make such big demands and waste everyone's time."


Alexia slipped her hand free from Eleanor's grip and folded her arms with ease. "I'm not playing around.Those are the terms-Roger walks out broke, or we go to war. I'll start tonight, and one by one, I'll bring you all down."


She threw a bold, deliberate look at Marilee, who instinctively shrank back in fear.


Ever since the live stream scandal, she had realized that Alexia wasn't someone to be underestimated.When it came to steering public opinion, Alexia was as skilled as any top PR expert. And if her secrets ever got out, Alexia wouldn't have to lift a finger-her competitors would do the dirty work for her.


She couldn't believe she had been foolish enough to trust Dina. If she could turn back time, she'd have stayed far away from this disaster.


"Roger..." Marilee whispered, holding onto his sleeve.Her eyes were red and full of tears, and she looked weak and helpless.


Even Brandon, who had been so arrogant moments ago, lost his composure. He grabbed onto Roger's leg like a drowning man reaching for a lifeline."Roger, I've already lost two fingers! You didn't help me last time. Are you really going to stand by again and watch?"



Surrounded by all the begging and shouting, Roger suddenly felt drained. A heavy tiredness washed over him.
The room stayed silent for a long timne until Alexia finail lost her patience. "So? Have you decided or not? I'm leaving."


'We'll accept your terms." Eleanor's quiet voice broke the tension.


Allen didn't say a word. His silence was as good as agreement.



Roger's voice trembled. "But Grandma..."



Everything he had built-years of effort, every dollar saved, even the wealth handed down from his father -was slipping through his fingers. The ache in his chest was unbearable.



Eleanor's voice was calm, but her expression was worn and tired, aged by the weight of the situation."What choice do we have? Do you want Marilee and Brandon to end up behind bars? We're old now; our reputations don't matter anymore. But you still have a future. The Gibson family still means something. As for money, it can always be made again."
The company was still standing. As long as that remained, there was still hope for a comeback.

###Chapter 88 Divorce

Watching the scene unfold; Roger hesitated, his hands balling and relaxing as he wrestled with his thoughts.


Just as Alexia was about to turn and walk out, he finally gathered his resolve and called after her.


"I'l go along with your conditions," Roger said,drawing in a shaky breath. "But you have to promise this ends here. You can't come after them again."


Alexia paused, her gaze sharpening. After a beat, she gave a nod that sounded almost genuine. "Agreed.As long as they stay out of my way, they'll never hear from me again."


Gloria, not ready to accept defeat, opened her mouth to protest, but Eleanor squeezed her hand tightly."Unless you want this to blow up even worse for our family,you'll keep quiet."
Gloria snapped her mouth shut, simmering with frustration, but knowing she'd never had much pull in the Gibson family.


Marilee chewed her lip, shrinking closer to Roger,forced to listen as he and Alexia ironed out the final terms of the divorce.



Alexia's tone left no room for negotiation. "Since we're clear that Roger leaves with nothing,there's nothing left to discuss. My lawyer will prepare the agreement, and you'll sign it. Be at the courthouse by nine tomorrow. If you're late, I can't promise I won't take action you'll regret."


Marilee's resentment boiled over at those words.Alexia was insufferable! Why had the Black Tiger Gang botched the job? She cursed Dina for promising it would all be handled seamlessly.


She had bought Dina's empty promises, and now Alexia stood poised to walk away with every last one of Roger's assets.


After leaving the Gibson family's residence, Alexia called her lawyel:.


The lawyer sounded stunned by the request. "Roger actually agreed to walk away with nothing? I was bracing for a brawl with his lawyer. How did you pull that off,Alexia?"


Alexia's tone was light, almost amused. "Honestly, I barely had to do anything-his girlfriend and cousin did the work for me. Just focus on getting that agreement finished and send it over tonight."


"You got it. I'll make sure you're more than satisfied with the agreement."


"Appreciate it. Let's catch up for lunch sometime soon."


Wearing a sharp royal blue suit, the lawyer leaned over her office window, watching the swirl of traffic and grinned. "Why not tomorrow? Once you're free of that marriage, we'll throw you a party."


Alexia faltered. "You think that's necessary?"


"Absolutely! Kicking a loser to the curb is cause for champagne and celebration. That's settled. I'll text you the plans. Make sure you bring Ada-I haven't seen her in ages."


With that, she cheerfully ended the call.


Alexia smiled to herself, shaking her head. After all this time, her friend hadn't changed-still fearless,still delightfully outrageous.


At the cafe beside the courthouse the following morning, Roger showed up before she did. He flipped through the agreement in silence, face set in stone,and signed without a word.



He glanced at the woman sitting across from him-so distant, so unyielding-and a strange wave of confusion washed over him.


His mind wandered back two years, to the day they'd made it official. Alexia's face had held no hint of today's chill.


He remembered sunshine spilling through the windows. She'd been waiting in a white dress, the cafe buzzing around her, a picture of quiet grace in the middle of chaos.


The moment Roger walked in, she'd caught his eye immediately. Something about her presence that day -poised and mesmerizing-stood out.


He recalled how sour his mood had been. He hadn't planned to be gentle. But when she looked up and smiled, he'd felt a fleeting urge to see where things might go.


"Let's get this over with." Alexia's voice snapped him out of the memory, cool and businesslike.


Roger simply nodded, a flicker of awkwardness crossing his face as he returned the agreement.


Together, they exited the cafe, keeping distance between them. Only after the last formality at the courthouse was complete did Alexia finally exhale.


She could finally breathe. The nightmare of their marriage was at last behind her.


Without giving Roger a backward glance, Alexia pivoted and strode toward the exit.


Roger watched her retreat, a restless discomfort gnawing at him as she moved further away.


"Alexia!" he called out, his voice echoing through the hall and drawing a few curious glances, yet she didn't so much as flinch.


Not once did she glance over her shoulder.


Leaving the courthouse behind, Alexia put Roger's voice-and all that came with it-in the past.


She stepped into sunlight, clouds drifting lazily across a wide blue sky. Eyes half-closed, she felt a peacefulness she hadn't known in ages.


"Today isn't the only good day-tomorrow looks bright,too."

 ###Chapter 89 Gigolos
After a moment of thought, Alexia snapped a quick photo of the corner of her divorce agreement and uploaded it to her feed.



For the caption, she simply typed, "Free!" and added a peace sign emoji.


As soon as it went live, she chuckled at herself. The post felt a bit childish, but she didn't care.


Right now, she just wanted to let the world know how she felt. Immature or not, it was her truth.


Moments later, a notification popped up. Curious,she tapped on it and saw that someone had already liked and commented on her post.


Ada had written, "Congrats! We're going out tonight to celebrate-no excuses!"



Even through a screen, Ada's energy was infectious. Grinning, Alexia typed back a quick reply confirmning she'd be there.


Then a message came from Andre. "Congrats! You're gonna find someone way better! Don't forget to keep me in mind-I'm still single and ready anytime!"


Alexia exhaled a long sigh and replied, "Thanks for the compliment, but seriously, why are you still like this? You know I'm not into playboys."


She had never taken Andre's pursuit seriously.


On the other end, Andre's grin faltered as he read her response.



For once, his usual charm couldn't cover the sting.His playful reputation had done him no favors, and now, he was realizing just how much it had cost him,especially with someone like Alexia.


Regret sowly settled in his chest.


Just as Alexia was setting her phone down, it buzzed again, and this time with a call from her lawyer friend,Sylvia Courtenay. "The private room's booked at the club tonight. Come have fun with Ada and me."


Alexia accepted without hesitation, asked for the address, and got ready to head out.


Meanwhile, Waylon sat quietly with his phone in hand. He stared at Alexia's post on his feed for a long time before finally tapping the like button.


Star Club was one of the hottest venues in Afoross,known for its live band performances and the idol groups that often graced its stage. The place pulsed with energy every night, attracting the city's trendiest crowd.



When Alexia stepped through the entrance, she didn't even have to try to make an impression-heads turned naturally as she passed through.


Up on the second floor, leaning against the railing, a girl perked up the moment she spotted her. "Tripp,hey! A stunning woman just walked in downstairs.I swear she looks exactly like your first love!"


Tripp Webster gave an eye-roll. "Don't start, Zoe.
Shouldn't you be studying? What are you even doing here?"



Zoe Webster retorted, "What's wrong with taking a little break? Even students need fun. And this is your club, remember? You're the boss, not me. But seriously, go look for yourself. She looks just like that girl from the photo you used to hide back in high school!"


Tripp's cheeks colored slightly. "Why are you still bringing that up? It was so long ago."


Still, curiosity tugged at him. He got up and joined her by the railing.


"There... by the entrance." Zoe pointed eagerly.


Down below, the club was alive. The music thumped,the crowd swayed, and the energy was electric. But Alexia stayed composed. She wasn't swayed by the noise or the chaos, nor did she seem irritated by any of it.



She had a delicate yet striking beauty-lively features paired with an unmistakable elegance. But it was the confidence in her eyes, bold and unshaken, that left a lasting impression.


Tripp blinked, momentarily stunned. The resemblance to his old crush was uncanny.


When Alexia finally reached the private room, Ada and Sylvia were already waiting inside.


What truly caught her off guard, though, were the two perfectly lined rows of strikingly handsome men,all decked out in sleek butler uniforms.


Ada and Sylvia were clearly having the time of their lives, grinning ear to ear.



Sylvia, one of Alexia and Ada's closest friends from their university days, had always been borilliant and fiercely loyal. Back in law school, she was not only top of the class but also the undeniable campus beauty.


"Alexia!" Sylvia beamed as she raised her glass.
 
"You're finally here! Tonight's all about you! Look at these handsome guys. Go ahead-take your pick and enio!


Alexia blinked in surprise. "Well, this is definitely not "hatlexpected."


Noticing her slight discomfort, one of the younger men came over with a kind smile. "Come and sit with me."



Maybe it was his boyish charm or the gentle coaxing tone, but Alexia found herself agreeing and sat down with him. As soon as she settled in, the young man popped open a chilled bottle of champagne and poured her a glass with smooth precision.


She took a small sip and glanced at his face-he was undeniably attractive, with bright eyes that made her feel a little unsettled. "How old are you, exactly?"


He smiled, a bit shyly. "Just turned eighteen last month."



That nearly made Alexia choke on her drink.


Alarmed, he leaned forward and gently patted her back as she coughed. "Hey, are you alright?"
###Chapter 90 Is She Saving Herself For Someone

Eighteen?


The image of Nolan, also eighteen and buried in textbooks, flashed through Alexia's mind.


She turned to the boy beside her and asked,"Shouldn't you be in school? Is this some kind of after-school gig?"


He rubbed the back of his neck, a little sheepish. "I'm not in school anymore. And don't worry. Even if I'm young, I know what I'm doing. I'm just as good as the older ones, maybe better."


The other men froze for a moment, shooting him looks full of contempt.


Still shaken, Alexia glanced over at Sylvia and called her out. "You're a lawyer, Sylvia! Don't you feel the least bit ashamed hiring someone so young?"
Sylvia, who was casually leaning into the man next to her, responded with a grin, "He said he's a pro, didn't he? He's just earning his way. You need to stop that savior complex of yours. You spentyears cleaning up the Jenkins and Gibson families' mess like it was your job. It drained you. Now that you're finally free,why not startliving for yourself?"


Ada chimed in, "Right? Sylvia's got a point. Women who overthink everything just end up tired and heartbroken. Look around-these guys are eye candy! Let yourself breathe a little."


Alexia didn't bother protesting. She reminded herself that this night was about unwinding. So, she waved at a few of the guys, told them to bring her drinks and help her relax, but strictly no getting too close.


Sylvia sighed,catching on to Alexia's guarded vibe.After a few rounds of drinks, she suddenly clapped her hands. "Let's spice things up with a card game!"


The game was a bold one-the person who drew the King card could command anyone to do anything. It was flirty, wild, and perfect for this kind of party.

The game began, and Ada pulled the King card first.She dared Sylvia to give a cheek kiss to a guy present. But Sylvia, never one to hold back, grabbed the guy beside her and gave him a long,fiery kiss that lasted nearly a minute. Alexia stared, wide-eyed,nearly getting up to leave.


Sylvia reached out and pulled her back down."Alexia, come on, why so shy? Look-money,affection, and physical needs don't have to come from the same man. Just split it up and enjoy life.Why burden yourself?"


Alexia admired her boldness but sighed. "I don't think I can do that, though."


Sylvia raised a brow. "Why not? Don't tell me none of them are your type."


Alexia gave a half-laugh, avoiding the question by staying quiet.


Sylvia squinted, sensing something was off. She turned to Ada and whispered, "She's been married.How is she still so shy? Is she saving herself for  Ada paused, scratching her head. "Oh right, didn't you hear? There were rumors that Alexia and Waylon were pretty close."


Sylvia's eyes went wide. "Wait, Waylon? Why was I the last to know something this juicy?"


Her voice climbed too high, prompting Ada to quickly nudge her and whisper, "Keep it down, will you?"


Sylvia blinked, regaining her composure, then leaned in with a curious smile. "So, what's the story there?Waylon,huh? Alexia's really something!"


Ada shrugged. "Honestly, I don't know."


Sylvia's lips lifted into a sly smile. A playful idea sparked in her mind, and without much thought, she took a quick photo of Alexia with the men around her.Leaning closer to Ada, she whispered, "Do you and Waylon follow each other on Facebook?"


Ada nodded in confusion. "Yeah.Why?"
 Sylvia sent the photo over, still grinning slyly. "You know exactly what to do with this."


Ada caught on instantly but looked hesitant. "Won't it come off too obvious if I post it?"


With an easy smirk, Sylvia crossed her arms. "It's just a casual get-together. Acouple of group photos,post them like we're having a blast, and it'Il all come off effortlessly."


Her tone turned playful. "If he has feelings for her,this will definitely shake him up tonight."


Ada shook her head, half-laughing. "You're terrible,Sylvia!"


But Sylvia's smile slowly vanished, her voice growing serious. "If this doesn't bother him at all, then he's not worthy of her."


Ada immediately agreed. "You're absolutely right!"


Without wasting time, she got to work-picked the best photos, added a playful filter, and uploaded them to her social media.
Her caption read, "It's been ages since | dropped by Star Club. Tonight's boys? Total eye candy. Who wants to go home when it's this fun?" Just to stir the pot a little more, she made sure to tag both Alexia and Sylvia at the end.
###Chapter 91 A Kiss
Waylon hadn't really been checking social media lately, but late that night, his phone buzzed with a message from Elton.


"Unbelievable! After Alexia ditched her husband,she'd rather seek the company of a male escort.Imagine that."



Attached beneath it was a screenshot of Ada's latest post.


Waylon's brows knitted together, and as he scrolled through the photos, a shadow passed over his face.


His eyes stayed on the picture of Alexia smiling with a group of men.


She looked happy.


Without saying a word, he stood up and walked out.On his way, he bumped into Simon, who was coming in with coffee.


Simon looked confused. "Mr. Mason, where are you headed?"



Waylon gave a cold smile. "To go get someone."


Sensing the stormy look on his face, Simon offered quickly, "I'll come along. I'll driv/e."


"No thanks," Waylon replied curtly. "You're too slow behind the wheel."



Then, without another glance, he turned and left.


Simon stood there, momentarily dejected by the rejection. But then it hit him-Waylon was going to drive himself. Panic started to bubble up.


Waylon wasn't just fast-he drove like he owned the road.



And judging by his expression, tonight's drive might be wild enough to cost him his license.


Nervous, Simon grabbed his keys, ready to follow,but by the time he got downstairs, Waylon had already roared off in his car.


Meanwhile, Elton leaned back in his chair, looking pleased with himself. He'd done his part and could already picture the chaos about to hit Alexia.


Right then, Bella walked over and quietly handed him a fresh cup of coffee.


Elton took a sip, nodding with approval. "You're getting better at this."


Bella gave a faint smile. "I'm glad it suits your taste."


Staring at her always composed, almost expressionless face, Elton asked, "Don't you ever feel lonely, being with me like this?"


Bella looked slightly caught off guard, then gently shook her head. "You've always treated me kindly."


"Still, being under someone else's thumb can't be truly fulfilling."


Bella kept her eyes lowered, her voice calm and firm.

"I've never cared much about freedom. What matters more to me are the things I can keep, like comfort and security, not some unclear feeling of being emotionally free."


Elton chuckled at her reply and tilted her chin up."You really are clever, even if you act like you're made of stone. Do you still have Alexia's business card?"



Bella stayed quiet for a few seconds, then slowly shook her head.



Elton smiled faintly as he lightly traced her lips with his thumb, the gesture both gentle and warning."If that's really the case, good. But if I find out otherwise, you won't like it. Got it?"


Bella nodded, calm as ever. "Don't worry. I understand."



Alexia remained completely unaware of what was heading her way.


Sylvia happened to draw the King card this time.Alexia had a strange feeling in her gut, and not the good kind. Her instinct proved right when Sylvia shot her a sly grin and pointed at her.


"Alexia, how about giving the guy next to you a kiss?Come on, we're not breaking any laws here.Honestly, this is the best age for a man, full of charm.Think about it. Men cheat all the time, even when they're married. So why shouldn't you,as a divorced woman, get to explore a little, too? The world is full of delicious options, and we deserve to enjoy them."


The young man beside Alexia gave an encouraging smile.


To him, Alexia was far from an ordinary client. Sure,money mattered in his line of work, but when a woman looked like that, charm often overtook price tags.


Beauty like hers didn't walk in every day. He was eager, his eyes lighting up as he subtly leaned closer and closed his eyes, waiting for her to come in.


Alexia hesitated, her mind swirling with thoughts she didn't expect.
Was it really that easy? Could she really satisfy her desires with someone she barely knew? Was it possible to separate the heart from physical longing so easily?


She was inches away, about to place a soft kiss on the young man's cheek, when a sudden noise from outside shattered the moment.


The door burst open without warning, making Sylvia and Ada jump in surprise. Alexia's head snapped toward the noise, and her whole body went still when she saw who was standing there.
###Chapter 92 Jealousy
\Waylon stood in the doorway, the crisp white shirt outlining the firm definition of his arms.


His mouth was set in a hard line, and his attention locked onto thne man beside Alexia with a fierce intensity.


The man stiffened under the pressure,clearly rattled.He took a nervous step back, trying to avoid Waylon's focus.



Alexia's eyes widened at the sight of him. "Why are you here?" she asked, caught off guard.


Waylon gave a dry laugh. "Why do you think?" His eyes flicked over to Ada.


Feeling the tension fill the room, Ada immediately shrank behind Sylvia.


Sylvia gave her a reassuring squeeze, doing her best to appear unfazed, though the tension in her posture betrayed her unease.


When it became clear Alexia didn't grasp what was going on, Waylon's jaw tightened. He marched forward without pause, shoving the man away and pulling Alexia close without asking.


His hands came up to her face, giving ita brief shake as his voice dripped with contempt. "Alexia, is this really your idea of fun? You've got awful taste if this is what you're into."


The insult landed like a punch. The men around them looked crushed, pride visibly dented.


Even Sylvia flinched, stung by the implication. Taking a breath, she forced a smile through clenched teeth."These are the finest in the city. You can't even book them for less than a million per night."


Waylon tilted his head, a mocking smile playing on his lips. "If that's your definition of premium, no wonder real quality's hard to find."
Sylvia's expression twitched in annoyance. Ada gently rubbed her back, whispering, "Don't let him get to you."


Waylon had always known how to hit a nerve. That much hadn't changed.


Alexia pushed his hand away, baffled. "Waylon, what are you doing right now?"


He gave a faint snort, the corner of his mouth lifting."What am I doing? Isn't it clear? My jealousy is practically gleaming."


The bluntness of his reply left her momentarily speechless. Her heart skipped, and a warm flush crept up her ears.


"It was just a game," she mumbled.


Waylon raised an eyebrow, his voice tinged with mockery. "A kissing game? With strangers? That's your idea of fun?"


Embarrassment flared in her chest, mingling with irritation. "That's none of your business. Who do you think yyou are to me?"


The air shifted between them, the tension rising. Off to the side, Sylvia and Ada exchanged looks, silently enjoying the show as if watching a scene unfold in one of their favorite romance dramas.



Waylon didn't take offense. He studied her face carefully. "That depends. Who do you want me to be?"



His forwardness caught her off guard. She quickly looked away, avoiding the question. Her tone turned brisk as she faced the others. "Actually, I just remembered I've got plans tonight. I'm heading out,bye!" She snatched her bag from the couch and walked off without giving them time to respond.


Sylvia let out a long sigh, raising her hand in a half-hearted wave. "Alright, bye."


Before leaving, Waylon sent a cold stare in Sylvia's direction. "This shouldn't repeat itself."


Sylvia huffed, smacking her thigh. "What a drama queen!"


Ada nudged her and whispered, "Can you not say that so loudly? He's still close by."


The truth was, Waylon wasn't someone they wanted to cross.



Meanwhile, Alexia stood in the elevator, her thoughts spinning out of control, thelingering alcohol only making everything worse.


She couldn't think straight, everything kept circling back to Waylon. The way he'd looked at her, steady and sincere.



She felt her heart race. Maybe she really was falling for him.



But even admitting that to herself felt too risky.


She had just gotten out of a terrible marriage. How could she be swayed again so soon? And by Waylon,of all people?


Sure, he was confident, good-looking, and seemed to have everything together, but was she truly that fragile? Did a single moment of affection fromn him really throw her off balance?


They had spent most of their lives as rivals, not lovers.





"I can't afford to lose. Not now. Not ever," she muttered under her breath, as if the words could shield her. "It's probably just hormones... or maybe the alcohol talking."



Her thoughts ran so wild, she didn't see the person in front of her until it was too late. She walked straight into him.


Clutching her forehead, she winced. "Sorry, I wasn't paying attention."


The man she bumped into, Tripp, looked surprised.But the moment he recognized her features, he seemed thrown off. "It's alright," he replied, sounding flustered.


Alexia offered a faint, polite smile. Her head still felt light from the impact, and she reached for her phone, planning to book a ride.


Tripp hesitated, then took a breath and spoke up."Excuse me, could I get your contact number?"
###Chapter 93 Are You Coming Home With Me
Alexia did not even bother to lift her eyes. "No."


Tripp stood there, feeling awkward and let down as he stared at her. "Do you have a boyfriend?"


Before she had a chance to answer, Waylon caught up and grabbed her hand. He ignored Tripp completely. "Alexia, I never knew you could be so shy."


Color rushed into Alexia's cheeks. She jerked her hand back and covered her ears, darting ahead."Who's shy? That's not me!"


Waylon let out a quiet laugh, trailing behind her with slow steps. His eyes softened with a look she could not quite name.


Tripp watched their exchange until they disappeared through the doorway. He pulled out a cigarette, lit it,
and took a few slow puffs before the urge faded awav.


So she already had a boyfriend. Disappointment settled over him.


In the end, Alexia could not flag down a taxi and ended up getting swept into Waylon's car instead.


All around them, the city sparkled under the night lights, cars rushing by in every direction.


Alexia sat in the passenger seat, her head clouded from drinking, and found herself sneaking glances at Waylon,studying his features quietly.


Her eyes drifted to his lips.


She remembered hearing once that men with lips like his were considered the most alluring, the kind that drew women in without effort.


Whether or not that was true, Alexia could not deny that Waylon had an undeniable charm. If he had ever wanted to, the rumors about his love life could have filled a book by now.
Yet the truth was-if it had not been for her, his reputation would have stayed spotless.


A man like that made it hard for her not to fall for him,but she could not help worrying that it might all end in heartbreak once again.


She must have let her eyes linger too long, because when the car stopped at a red light, Waylon glanced over with a curious look. "What were you staring at just now?"


Alexia hesitated for a moment, then pointed out the window and said simply, "It just looks beautiful."


Waylon followed her finger and saw a huge flower bed woven with bright neon lights. Nearby, a fountain sparkled in the glow, reminding him of stars scattered across the night.


He took in the scene for a moment. "You're right, it really is beautiful."


Alexia grinned. "That's because I've got an eye for spotting beauty."

Before she could say anything more, she heard Waylon's quiet laugh close to her ear. "Alexia, I was talking about you. You look amazing with the lights on your face."


His comment sent her heart skipping. She glanced up at his warm smile, keeping her guard up around this dangerously charming man. "You keep flattering me while I'm tipsy. Are you hoping I'll come home with you tonight?"


Waylon arched his eyebrow, a flash of surprise showing before his usual calm returned. "Then... are you coming home with me?"


Alexia's cheeks turned pink. "No way! I'mn going to my own place."


He just grinned and played along. "Whatever you say."


After their playful banter, Alexia felt a wave of drowsiness wash over her. Before long, she drifted off, her head resting against the seat, lips parted as she slipped into gentle, even breaths.

Waylon let out a silent sigh. He noticed how she kept her guard up, yet somehow, she was not all that distant.


When they finally pulled up to Alexia's place, Waylon reached over and gently nudged her awake. "Come on, we're here."


Still lost in a sleepy haze, Alexia turned away and complained quietly about feeling dizzy.


Waylon asked, "Do you want me to carry you inside?"


Without a second thought, Alexia stretched out her arms. "Yes, please. I really don't want to walk."


If she wanted to be carried, then he was happy to help.



Waylon leaned down and scooped her up, holding her securely in his arms. Alexia tucked herself against him, shifting now and then as she searched for a more comfortable spot to rest.


She kept fidgeting, and it made the walk up to her apartment a bit of a challenge for Waylon.
Once they reached her door, he prompted her to open it. Thankfully, her place was equipped with a fingerprint lock.


After setting her down on the living room couch,he carefully smoothed out her tangled hair. She remained sound asleep, eyes closed and breathing softly.


Waylon glanced at Alexia, still tipsy and peaceful,then headed for the kitchen to check the fridge.


He decided he would cook some soup before heading out.

###Chapter 94 A Passionate Kiss

Once the soup was done, Waylon leaned over and lightly nudged Alexia's shoulder. "Wake up."


Alexia slowly blinked her eyes open, still dazed from the alcohol. Her usually clear gaze was hazy. She took a small sip of the soup, then frowned in disgust."Oh my god, what is this? Did you boil gym socks?"


Waylon, a bit offended, scratched his chin, looking slightly embarrassed. "Is it seriously that bad?"


Alexia pouted, setting the spoon down. "You always test your questionable cooking on me."


Waylon kept a deadpan expression. "Clearly, it's the soup's fault. Not mine."


Alexia pushed the bowl aside. The bitterness didn't help sober her up, it only made her more irritable.Annoyed with how disoriented she still felt, she abruptly tugged at Waylon's tie, pulling him down onto the sofa with her.


"You're really something," she muttered, tracing his face with her fingers like she was trying to memorize every line. "You know what people say about me?That I snagged you with my looks. But have they seen you? Maybe you seduced me with that annoyingly perfect face of yours. Has anyone ever thought of that?"



Waylon blinked, surprised by her boldness. Then a slow, dangerous smile crept onto his face. "And here I thought you were shy," he murmured, leaning in until their foreheads almost touched. His voice dropped. "How about a lesson then? You show me how you'd like to be seduced."



Alexia's thoughts were too foggy to come up with a clever comeback. She wasn't prepared for his voice to sound that seductive.



Acting on impulse, she brought her hands to his jaw,tilted his face slightly, and pressed her lips to his without a second thought.
Waylon was caught off guard as her soft lips met his.


The kiss started clumsily, hesitant and brief, but Waylon quickly took over, turning it into something deeper, more purposeful.


Every movement of his lips was deliberate, stirring a growing heat between them, wrapping the room in tension.



Alexia was breathless, her strength melting beneath the intensity of his kiss. Sensing the awkward angle,Waylon slipped his arms around her waist and effortlessly pulled her onto his lap. His lips wandered -from her mouth to her jawline, brushing over her cheeks and settling behind her ear, before trailing sensually down her neck.



Alexia couldn't resist him. His touch, his breath-they felt addictive.



Her body reacted in a way she didn't understand,craving more. It wasn't just about the kisses anymore.

She found herself wanting something deeper,something she'd never felt with anyone else.


With every caress, her desire deepened, going beyond mere physical contact. As the buttons of his shirt came undone, Waylon paused, his breath catching in his throat.


The way she looked up at him-glassy eyes, swollen lips-was enough to shatter any shred of control he had left.



But then, a flash of logic cut through the haze.He remembered that she didn't hold her alcohol well.


If they crossed the line now, she might not even remember it. Worse, she could wake up and shrug it off with a vague "I was drunk." He didn't want that,not with her.



With that in mind, he leaned down and bit her lower lip, just hard enough to sting.


The metallic tang of blood touched his tongue,and Alexia suddenly blinked, startled back to reality.

The heat in Waylon's eyes hadn't disappeared. He reached out, brushing his fingers lightly across her flushed lips, his voice low and rough. "Do you really think I'm that easy to win over, Alexia?"


He had his pride. When it came to her, he couldn't settle for anything less than sincere love.


When she didn't respond and just stared at him,dazed and unsure, Waylon let go of her and adjusted the collar she had tugged out of place.


"If you want me, then give me your heart."


Without waiting for a reply, he turned and walked out,closing the door behind him.


Alexia sat there, confused and overwhelmed. She tried to figure out what he meant, but before she could make sense of anything, sleep took over.


The next morning, her internal clock did its job and woke her on time, though her head felt like it had been run over.


Still half-asleep, she slowly made her way to the bathroom to freshen up.


As she stood in front of the mirror, something caught her eye-the faint bite mark on her lips and the reddish patches trailing down her neck.


She froze, staring blankly for a few seconds before the memories of the last night came rushing back in fragments. The kisses. The touches. Waylon's breath on her skin. Her cheeks turned bright red.


Alexia groaned softly and raked a hand through her hair, feeling a mix of regret and embarrassment flooding in.


What on earth had gotten into her last night? She actually flirted with Waylon like that? So boldly?


And the worst part wasn't her own boldness-it was that he had walked away.


Yes,he left. In the middle of all that! Why? Did he not want her? Or was she just not irresistible enough?


Alexia had a history of forgetting things when she drank too much, and beyond the kissing, everything Waylon had said was a blur.


Staring at her reflection, Alexia puffed her cheeks,then nodded with mock confidence. "Still pretty.Clearly, the problem's not me. Waylon's just got questionable taste."


But even as she joked to herself, a new anxiety started creeping in. After everything that happened last night, how was she supposed to face him again?
 
###Chapter 95 You'll Spend Your Whole Life Stuck In Alexia's Shadow

Marilee had just wrapped up her work when her phone suddenly rang. It was Evelyn calling,demanding that she come home immediately.


The second she entered the house, Marilee spotted her mother in the living room. Evelyn's expression left no doubt that she was furious.


An uneasy knot formed in Marilee's stomach. "Mom,why did you want me to come back so urgently?"


Evelyn sneered, "Isn't it obvious? Eleanor stormed in here and tore into us, saying we'd raised a foolish,careless daughter!"


"You all know?" Marilee blurted out, scrambling to explain herself. "Mom, I never meant for things to spiral like this. The Black Tiger Gang..."


Before Marilee could explain further, Evelyn silenced her with a swift gesture. Rising from the couch, she marched right up to Marilee and, without warning,slapped her hard across the face.


The sound echoed through the room.


Staggered, Marilee stared at her mother, disbelief and tears filling her eyes. "Mom..."


Evelyn could barely contain her frustration. "How many times do I need to remind you? Your choices reflect on everyone in the Jenkins family, not just yourself! If you weren't certain about the plan to take Alexia, why did you stick with it? Do you realize how much leverage the Gibson family has over us now? If word gets out, your future's on the line, and so is the reputation of the Lady Cat brand, and even Jenkins Group's stock is at risk. Haven't you noticed our stocks dropping? Are you really trying to make things even worse for us?"


That was the final straw. Feeling utterly wronged,Marilee lost control. She tossed her bag onto the floor, voice trembling with anger. "How much more do you expect me to take? I hate Alexia. Are you ever going to stand up for me? You kept me in someone else's home when I was little. I had to chase after Alexia in everything, even matching her test scores because you insisted on it. After every exam, you'd send me her grades to remind me how far behind l was. Alexia is all you care about. I've never been good enough for you, not even when I was a kid!"


Evelyn's patience snapped, her finger stabbing the air in accusation. "What nonsense are you spouting now? How many times do I have to remind you that Alexia was only a walking blood supply for you.I made it clear-once you recovered, you'd come home. Have you ever been denied anything you wanted? Did you ever go without? Alexia never even had a fraction of your allowance. When you dreamed of becoming an actress, I moved mountains to get you into show business."


Marilee, on the verge of breaking, screamed back,"So what would've happened if I never got better?Would Alexia get to keep my spot as your daughter forever? You brought her in because I was sick,just so nobody would whisper about our family. I never asked to be sick! Mom, didn't you know why l'd be sick in the first place?"


Evelyn's hand shot out, cutting her off with another harsh slap. "Enough! Not another word!"


The pain from that blow wasn't just on Marilee's cheek. It tore right through her heart.


Disappointment heavy in her voice, Evelyn went on,"Why did I get stuck with such a foolish child? You have no sense of priorities. You let your feelings dictate every move and never think about the consequences. This mess you started, you're going to fix it. Listen closely. You're done with Roger. I don't want to hear his name again. I've arranged for you to meet the heir to the Brooks family. The introduction is set for next Saturday, and you will be there."


Tears streaming down her face, Marilee stood her ground. "I'm not walking away from Roger. He's the only one who's ever really cared about me."


Evelyn let out a low chuckle. "I know you're just lashing out because you're upset. But let's be honest, the Gibson famnily isn't what they used to be.If you tie yourself to Roger, you'll end up miserable.You've always thrived on luxury and everyone's admiration. Are you truly prepared to throw all that away for a man Alexia cast aside?"


A cold wave swept over Marilee, leaving her stunned by her mother's ruthless words. "But you promised could be with Roger. That's what you told me."


Evelyn simply turned her back, folding her arms with an air of indifference. "All I ever wanted was for you to keep Roger on a string, to make Alexia jealous and humiliated. I never expected you to actually fall for him."


Marilee's fingers dug into the fabric of her dress,her knuckles turning white.


"Now that their marriage is over, you have no reason to hang on to Roger. He was just a convenient pawn.As a Jenkins, you should be aiming higher, planning for your future. I want more for you than what Alexia has, so much more. The Brooks family is new money,but their influence is growing by the day. I've worked  hard to set up this introduction. Don't throw it away.If you miss this chance, you'll spend your whole life stuck in Alexia's shadow!"
###Chapter 96 I'm Sure You'll Come Around
Marilee bit her lower lip before asking, "So that's it?Everything Alexia did just gets swept under the rug?"


Evelyn let out a long breath and leaned back into the couch, rubbing her temples as if trying to calm a headache.



"Listen, Marilee, you've got to stop looking at this emotionally and start thinking smart. If you connect with the Brooks family, you'll have real power behind you. Now, if you're still set on payback, I can help,but only if you start thinking clearly. Go on this date,and I promise, Alexia won't get off easy."


Marilee's heart didn't feel as heavy after hearing that.A part of her was starting to consider Evelyn's offer.


After all, her mother wasn't lying-she had the looks and the brains. She deserved someone better than Roger.


Maybe going on the date wouldn't be so bad, as long as Roger never found out.


Meanwhile, Roger sat alone at a bar, drowning his mood in alcohol.


Halfway into his drink, a waiter placed a martini in front of him.



Roger narrowed his eyes. "This isn't mine. You've got the wrong table."


"Actually, that one's from me," a voice chimed in from nearby before the waiter could reply.


Roger turned to see a man strolling over, wearing a bold red shirt, hair slicked back like he was auditioning for a movie, and a flashy Rolex catching the light.



The man stopped by their table and greeted him casually, "You must be Roger Gibson. I've heard a lot about you. I'm Vinson Hardy."
Roger gave him a once-over, his eyes briefly showing a flicker of contempt.


A nouveau riche.


Roger wasn't interested, and he kept his tone frosty "Take your drink and leave."


But Vinson didn't flinch. He pulled out the chair across from Roger and sat down. "Mr. Gibson, you really do live up to your reputation. But how long can you keep up this arrogant act? Gibson Group hasn't exactly been shining in the stock market lately. I also heard you're after the west city project. Honestly,some people just have terrible instincts-doesn't matter how rich they are; they'll still waste it all."


Roger set his glass down and shot him a deadly glare. "Since when do nobodies like you have opinions on the Gibson family? Walk away while I'm still being polite."


Vinson just shrugged like it was nothing. "Funny thing. I'm one of the investors here. If someone's getting kicked out, it won't be me."
Roger's expression turned colder. "Owning part of a bar doesn't mean you get to be a pest."


Vinson lit a cigarette, took a slow drag, then casually slid a business card across the table to Roger. "I'm here with a genuine offer. Rather than putting all your energy into flashy tourism ventures, have you thought about pivoting toward something bigger?These days, it's the tech companies that shape the future. You know that better than anyone. Otherwise,you wouldn't have started Black Dawn Tech. But let's be honest, your products haven't quite hit the mark,and the funding hasn't exactly been smooth either.So why not team up with us? It could be the push your company needs."



Roger gave the card a quick look, not hiding his skepticism.



"Dracnesse International Biotech? A regional manager?" Roger read aloud with a raised brow, then let out a dry laugh. "What kind of no-name operation is this? Never heard of it."

Vinson stubbed out his cigarette. "True, we're under the radar and not huge yet, but our research team is top-tier-way ahead of what your guys are working with at Black Dawn Tech."


Roger leaned back, clearly uninterested, and didn't even try to mask it. "Your team's resume doesn't concern me. Black Dawn Tech's future lies in Al and digital tech-not biotech. We're not even in the same lane,so what exactly are you trying to prove here?"


Vinson raised an eyebrow and looked straight at him,his tone sharp. "Are you really unaware, or just choosing to ignore it? Black Dawn Tech's falling stock and market pessimism all stem from one thing -investors have lost confidence in your company.You've had no real product release in ages. To the outside world, it's starting to look like a scam. How long do you think you can survive by sellingjust ideas? Our company has a capable research team,but we lack a strong platform in this country. If we partner up, you can take the naming rights and half the product copyright."
Roger's expression changed the moment he heard that. "I'll have to think it over."


Still, Vinson didn't back off. "Take all the time you need, but I'm sure you'll come around. The summit's just around the corner, right? It's the best time for you to reflect. Sit in the audience, listen to the discussions, and see for yourself if anyone brings up those failing sectors the Gibson family is still trying to hold on to."
###Chapter 97 Have Some Faith In Your Cooking,Will You
Today was the last day Alexia would be bringing Waylon glazed ribs.


As she packed the lunchbox, her face looked serious.


A lot had happened over the past week. She had canceled on Waylon twice because of personal matters.



Thinking about it now, she realized it wasn't fair and didn't match her values of being honest and reliable.


So today, feeling genuinely remorseful, she made the lunch with care, hoping to use this chance to apologize for how recklessly she'd behaved the night before.



No matter what their relationship was or might turn into, that didn't justify her impulsiveness.
 Carrying her guilt, Alexia showed up at Waylon's office right around lunchtime.


As the elevator doors opened, she ran right into Waylon in the hallway.


His usual calmness somehow made her feel even more self-conscious. "Hi, Waylon," she greeted, a bit stiffly.


Waylon arched a brow and let out a small chuckle,though it felt slightly forced. "What brings you by without any warning?"


" just remembered I had to bring you the batch of glazed ribs today-the last time."


"The last time, huh? You make it sound like I won't be around to eat any more."


Alexia quickly waved her hand and gave a nervous laugh. "No, no, don't say that! You'll get plenty more and live a long, healthy life!"


Simon, watching from nearby, couldn't help but frown.What was going on between the two now?
Waylon nodded politely. "'Thank you, but I won't be able to enjoy your ribs today. I've got a two-hour meeting starting in ten minutes."


"That's alright. I'll wait. I have something I need to talk to you about in person," Alexia replied, keeping her smile intact.


Waylon shot Simon a look, and Simon instantly understood. "Ms. Jenkins, this way please. You can wait in the lounge."


"Thanks," Alexia said politely with a small nod.


She walked over to the sofa, sat down quietly, and waited patiently.


One hour went by.


Then two.


Then three.



And finally-four.


Her calm and quiet patience slowly turned into full-blown frustration.
A million wild thoughts flooded her mind.


Why was Waylon still not back? Was he doing this on purpose?


Was he angry? Most likely!


She smacked her forehead in disbelief.


Seriously? Had she actually believed he'd return?She must've been out of her mind. Of course he was playing with her.


Waylon was clever. If he wanted to mess with someone, he could do it in his sleep. He must be mad, and this was payback.


"Waylon, you stingy jerk!" she muttered under her breath.



And just as her frustration hit its peak, the door finally opened and Waylon walked in.


Caught off guard, Alexia shot up from the couch in a panic, only to lose her balance and fall right back down with a thud.
 Leaning against the doorframe wwith his usual calm demeanor, Waylon raised a brow and smirked."Alexia, what were you calling me just now?"


Alexia quickly smoothed down her messy hair and acted as if nothing had happened. "What? I didn't say anything. You must've imagined it. Didn't you say the meeting would last two hours? | waited nearly four. Is this how a man of honesty and integrity behaves?"



Instead of getting flustered, Waylon remained cool and composed. "There were some unexpected delays. But when exactly did I ever say I was honest and trustworthy? Do you have a time, place, or quote? Or was that just something you made up in your sleep?"


Alexia was at a loss for words. His comebacks were way too sharp.


She huffed, unable to hold it in any longer. "Waylon, I honestly pity the girl who ends up dating you."


Unbothered, he shot back, "Don't waste your sympathy on others. You'd do better worrying about yourself."


Maybe it was guilt over what happened the night before, or maybe she just didn't have the energy to argue-either way, Alexia found herself unusually patient with Waylon today. "I actually came to talk to you about something."


Waylon's expression shifted slightly, his gaze focusing on her. "Alright, I'm listening."


Just as she opened her mouth to speak, an unexpected sound cut her off-her stomach growled loud and clear.



Waylon's eyes instantly dropped to her flat stomach.


Mortified, Alexia slapped a hand over her face.If only she could sink into the floor right then and there.


"You haven't eaten?" Waylon asked, frowning. "You seriously sat here for four hours without touching a thing? Are you insane?"


"I just wasn't hungry before," she muttered defensively.


Waylon walked over and took her wrist. "Come on,let's go get food."


"But I made glazed ribs," she mumbled, thinking it'd be easier to just warm them in the microwave.



Waylon, as if he knew what she was thinking,looked over and said, "Alexia, those are mine. I'll eat them tonight."


Alexia blinked, confused. "But they're not even fresh anymore. Doesn't that bother you?"


Waylon reached out and tapped her forehead gently with his knuckles. "Have some faith in your cooking,will you? Whatever you make tastes good no matter when I eat it."

###Chapter 98 Could This Be Her Revenge
Alexia was momentarily taken aback.


No one had ever said something like that to her before.



For most of her life, cooking had been a basic skill-nothing more than a way to survive. She never really tried to make it special. It was only later, when she moved away for high school and lived alone in a small rented apartment, that she began to put more effort into it. With no one around, it became a quiet way to pass time.


Even after marriage, she kept cooking regularly. Part of it was routine, but mostly, it was because Gloria had a leg injury and needed someone to handle things in the kitchen. Gloria would often make comments like, "It's a simple joy to enjoy a meal cooked by my daughter-in-law."

Alexia still remembered one particular conversation with Gloria that left a bitter taste in her mouth. She had suggested hiring a maid, but Gloria had shut her down, saying, "You've married my son. That makes you one of us. You're expected to contribute to this family."


Alexia had been baffled. "I married your son, not sold myself to your family. It's not like maids are that expensive."


Gloria had let out a cold laugh before snapping,"That's easy for you to say. If it weren't forthe Gibson family, your family would've gone under long ago. Your family came to us, begging Roger to marry you. Don't forget, your mother had you sign the prenup without even blinking. She knew what she owed. So don't act so high and mighty. You're here to repay their debt. Understand? Now go and cook."


Even now, thinking back to those words, Alexia could still feel the sting. They had been sharp,humiliating,and impossible to forget.


But what made her feel even more ashamed now was how hard she had tried-how much of herself she poured into that family, tiying to win over Gloria and protect the Jenkins family's reputation in the eyes of the Gibsons. She had been so eager to please, and for what?



"What are you zoning out for?" Waylon's voice gently tugged her back to the present.


Startled, Alexia blinked and forced a faint smile. "I was just thinking... no one's ever complimented my cooking before."


Naylon let out a snort. "That's probably because hey don't know good food when they taste it. But didn't I praise it before?" He paused, pouting slightly.I clearly remember complimenting it once. You just orgot."


Her eyes twinkled with amusement as she looked at him, catchinghis mock-offended expression. Even annoyed, he somehow still managed to be charming.


They walked out of the elevator side by side. The building stood in the heart of the city's busiest district, surrounded by designer boutiques and elegant restaurants.


"I made a dinner reservation," Alexia said. "Since we missed lunch, this one's on me."


Wayion gave a soft sigh. "Alexia, do you really enjoy treating people to meals this much? Honestly, if we're being fair, it was my fault for making you wait all that time."


Before he could say more, Alexia shot him a cheeky glare. "I'm glad you realize that."


Waylon froze, clearly caught off guard by her quick comeback. Though she was offering to treat him,it was obvious she wasn't exactly thrilled about it.


As they stepped out of the elevator together, heads started turning.


The reason was simple-until now, no woman had ever exited the building alongside Waylon. Alexia was the first, and her appearance instantly stirred curiosity throughout the building.
"Whoa, who's that stunning woman with Mr. Mason?She seems really close to him."


"She looks familiar. I think l've seen her on a livestream before."


"Wait, is that Alexia? The one who clapped back at Marilee's fans-the so-called fake daughter?"


"Seriously? That's her? She's even more gorgeous in real life!"



"How on earth did she end up with Mr. Mason? She must have something special..."


Even Alexia could feel the heat of all those curious glances. But oddly enough, when she was with Waylon, the rumors and stares didn't bother her.


Just as they were about to exit, Alexia suddenly came to a stop and turned to him. "Wait here for me.I just need to take care of something real quick. I'll be right back!"


Before Waylon could even respond, she was already darting off, disappearing into the crowd.
At the building entrance, people flowed in and out.Some employees, upon seeing Waylon, quickly changed course to avoid him altogether. Others, a little braver, gave nervous bows before hurrying away. Everyone was curious why Waylon was waiting at the entrance.



Who was he waiting for? It couldn't be Simon,because he wouldn't dare to make Waylon wait.



"It's been almost twenty mninutes. Has anyone ever seen Mr. Mason wait this long for anyone?"


"This is wild. It's always people waiting for him. Not the other way around."


"Right? In the business world, who would even dare let Mr.Mason wait?"



"But here he is, waiting at the entrance like a regular person. This is huge!"


"So who is it? Who's important enough for Mr. Mason to stand here like this?"


The crowd kept whispering among themselves, while Wavion stood still, with one hand casually in his pocket. He checked his watch, his eyes narrowing slightly as he wondered what was taking Alexia so long.


Could this be her revenge? Was she trying to get even by making him wait four hours in return?
###Chapter 99 Mrs. Mason
Alexia stepped into the flower shop and browsed through the fresh blooms. She picked out some yellow roses and a few daisies. With the shop assistant's help, she arranged themn into a lovely new bouquet.



As they tied the ribbon, the assistant smiled and asked, "Miss, is this for someone special or just a treat for yourself?"


Alexia cradled the bouquet in her arms, her smile gentle. "A friend."


The woman beamed. "Well then, whoever that friend is, man or woman,they're very lucky."


With the bouquet in hand, Alexia hurried back toward the building. As she ran under the golden sun, hair bouncing and flowers pressed to her chest, she turned more than a few heads.
Strangers paused in their tracks just to watch her. In that moment, she looked like something out of a movie-effortless, glowing,real.


When she reached the entrance, she waved at Waylon, completely unaware of the shock on the faces around her.



Breathless from the run, her cheeks flushed a soft pink, and her eyes sparkled as she stopped in front of him.


With a radiant smile, she held out the bouquet. "This is for you."


A wave of silence passed over the small crowd nearby.





Was she really handing flowers to Waylon just like that? Was this some kind of public confession?


Caught off guard, Waylon stared at the bouquet,visibly surprised.


He took the flowers, his fingers brushing against the petals."Yellow roses? What do they mean?"

"They're for apologies," Alexia said, her voice soft but clear. "They stand for sincerity and friendship.But really, before anvthing else, I just wanted to thank you."


Waylon glanced up, intrigued. "Thank me?"


She nodded, her gaze fixed on him with quiet warmth. "Thank you for coming back into my life. I don't know what fate has planned for us, but l'm really grateful we crossed paths again. Meeting you again is wonderful."


Because of him, she was able to close a painful ###Chapter in her life much faster than she ever expected.


Waylon studied her for a long second, tilting his head. "Do you always disarm people like this?"


Alexia blinked in confusion. "I'm just being honest."


Waylon let out a low chuckle and leaned in slightly."Well, it's the first time a woman's ever given me flowers, so I wouldn't know."
Alexia froze for a moment, unsuire how to respond.


"But Alexia, if anyone deserves thanks, it's you. You should be thanking yourself. For some people, your presence is the best gift."


Hearing that, Alexia quickly looked away, trying not to get lost in his magnetic gaze. She cleared her throat and shifted the topic. "Anyway, I also wanted to say sorry about last night."


Waylon, now absently adjusting the bouquet in his hands, gave her a side glance. "A casual apology like that? No way. That's something we'll need to talk about properly. And do you really want to air our private business in front of everyone?"


Alexia turned her head and realized a sizable crowd had formed, eyes wide with curiosity, whispers swirling around them like a breeze.


Without thinking twice, she grabbed Waylon's arm and dragged him away. "Let's jst go!"


Waylon didn't resist, letting her pull him along. A faint smile tugged at his lips. "By the way, I prefer irises over roses. Just keep that in mind next time."


Alexia shot him a look, her voice dry. "Then buy them yourself."


Nearby, a group of employees exchanged stunned glances, struggling to believe what they had just seen.



As Alexia and Waylon walked off together under the curious gaze of everyone around, it didn't take long for whispers to explode into full-blown gossip, filling the air with wild speculation.


"Did you see that? Mr. Mason actually accepted those flowers!"


"Unbelievable. I wonder if I start showing up with flowers every day, will I stand a chance?"


"You? With your face? Simon wouldn't even let you past security!"


"Let's be real, guys. It's not about flowers or tricks.It's about being the right person. If you're the one,
even a piece of string looks like a diamond."


"I told you! Alexia's on another level. That girl's playing in the big leagues!"


Just then, Simon cut through the crowd, clearly annoyed by the gossip. He shot them a sharp look."Who gave you permission to call her by her first name?"


The group looked at each other, confused. "Uh, then what are we supposed to call her?"


Simon gave a quiet sigh. "You might have to call her Mrs.Mason someday."
###Chapter 100 You're Pushing Your Luck

At the restaurant, Alexia didn't hold back and ordered enough dishes to cover the entire table. She even toyed with the idea of adding a cocktail for some liquid courage.


However, the weight of Waylon's piercing stare made her rethink it. In the end, she settled for a glass of juice.



As they waited for their meals, Alexia tried to break the tension. She cleared her throat, fumbling for words. "About what happened last night... I was pretty out of it. I was drunk. I crossed a line, and I shouldn't have dragged you into it."


Waylon, completely unbothered, looked as though he'd been expecting this. "How much do you actually remember?"
Alexia hesitated, chewing on her lip as she tried to piece things together. "Um... I remember kissing you.That's about it."


A chill crept into Waylon's voice. "Just that? You don't remember anything else? Nothing from before or after?"



Confusion flickered in Alexia's eyes. She seemed to be silently asking, "What else did I miss?"


Seeing her bewildered face, Waylon feIt a strange mix of annoyance and helplessness.


He reminded her, "Do you even recall why I was there in the first place?"



Starving, Alexia grabbed a cherry tomato and took a big bite before she answered, "Now that you mention it, I wanted to ask you that, too. What's the reason you showed up? You looked upset, and you and Sylvia were about to start a fight."


For a brief moment, Waylon's face went still, and a faint twitch pulled at the edge of his mouth.

Looking back, he was beyond grateful that he'd managed to leave when he did. If he hadn't, Alexia would probably be denying everything right now, and she'd have gotten away with even more than just a kiss.



The waiter appeared with their food just then, placing a plate of beef stew and mashed potatoes in front of Alexia. She picked up her spoon, ready to eat, but Waylon's voice drifted across the table, calm and clear. "I was jealous. That's why I came."


Stunned, Alexia's spoon clattered onto the table.


Unfazed, Waylon simply nodded at the waiter to bring her a replacement.



When the waiter brought over a fresh spoon,Waylon noticed Alexia still staring blankly, caught completely off guard. "You look shocked. Didn't expect me to say that, did you?"


Alexia remained rooted in place, almost as if she hadn't heard him at all.
Waylon leaned in, voice steady. "No matter how surprised you are, I'm not taking it back. And you can't pretend those words didn't reach you."


Fluistered, Alexia grabbed her spoon and dug into her stew, clearly hoping to change the subject. "Can we just eat?"


Waylon's gaze turned unreadable, shadows flickering in his eyes.


A moment later, the server placed a steaming plate of crawfish on the table.



Alexia slipped on a pair of gloves and started peeling,but soon realized Waylon hadn't touched his food,the tension growing between them. Trying to lighten the mood, she asked, "You're not hungry?"



Waylon rested his chin on his hand, watching her with lazy amusement. "Why don't you peel one for me?"



Alexia shot him a look. "Half the point of eating crawfish is doing it yourself."
With a faint smile, Waylon replied, "I can live without that experience. You do it."


Irritation flashed across Alexia's face as she bit into a piece of crawfish, shooting him a glare. "You're pushing your luck."


Waylon's laughter was quiet but unmistakable. "And some people are quite skilled at acting clueless."


Alexia was about to answer, but before she could get a word out, a woman's voice called out, smooth and pleasant, "Mr.Mason?"


Turning, Alexia spotted a young woman in a smoky lavender silk dress.



Long, glossy waves of hair framed her delicate features. Her skin glowed under the crystal chandelier, and a pair of dramatic, blood-red gemstone earrings sparkled at her ears, completing her striking look.


An absolutely gorgeous woman! Alexia took in the woman's elegance, unable to hide her admiration.
She quietly sipped her juice, watching the exchange unfold.


Waylon raised an eyebrow, showing mild surprise,though his voice stayed as frosty as ever. "What brings you here?"


For a moment, the woman hesitated, but quickly found her composure. "Oh, nothing important. I'm just out with friends and happened to notice you here,so | wanted to say hello."


Waylon offered nothing in return, letting a heavy silence fill the space.


As the quiet stretched on, the woman tried again,forcing a cheerful tone. "By the way, my birthday's coming up next week. Will you be able to make it?"


Waylon's answer was swift and unyielding. "I won't.I'm busy."


Clearly caught off guard by his bluntness, she blinked in surprise. "But your grandfather mentioned you'd be there."
That comment made something inside Alexia tighten.She shot a glance at Waylon, noticing how his face darkened for just a second before he masked it with his usual cool indifference.


"If you're relyìng on my grandfather's promises, why bother asking me?"


The woman wasn't about to give up that easily. She kept her smile in place, brushing off the rejection with practiced grace. "Well, even if you skip the party, I'll look forward to your present." She let her gaze slide over to Alexia, a not-so-subtle challenge in her eyes.


Alexia's looks were impossible to ignore, and the woman, Selena Brooks, took note-she studied Alexia with barely hidden suspicion before returning her attention to Waylon.


With a sweet, almost innocent smile, she asked Waylon, "And who might this be? Are you going to introduce us?"
